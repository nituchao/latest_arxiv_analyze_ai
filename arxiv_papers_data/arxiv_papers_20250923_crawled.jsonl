Among these ML and AI approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to be a very promising approach by several authors. However, a problem with using Reinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control is the reliability of the trained RL agents due to the dynamically changing distribution of the input data with respect to the distribution of the data used for training. This presents a major challenge and a reliability problem for the trained network of AI agents and could have very undesirable and even detrimental consequences if a suitable solution is not found. Several researchers have tried to address this problem using different approaches. In particular, Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta RL) promises to be an effective solution. In this paper, we evaluate and analyze a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach called MetaLight and show that, while under certain conditions MetaLight can indeed lead to reasonably good results, under some other conditions it might not perform well (with errors of up to 22%), suggesting that Meta RL schemes are often not robust enough and can even pose major reliability problems."}

However, this same capability introduces a critical risk of what we term knowledge-driven hallucination: a phenomenon where the model's output contradicts explicit source evidence because it is overridden by the model's generalized internal knowledge. This paper investigates this phenomenon by evaluating LLMs on the task of automated process modeling, where the goal is to generate a formal business process model from a given source artifact. The domain of Business Process Management (BPM) provides an ideal context for this study, as many core business processes follow standardized patterns, making it likely that LLMs possess strong pre-trained schemas for them. We conduct a controlled experiment designed to create scenarios with deliberate conflict between provided evidence and the LLM's background knowledge. We use inputs describing both standard and deliberately atypical process structures to measure the LLM's fidelity to the provided evidence. Our work provides a methodology for assessing this critical reliability issue and raises awareness of the need for rigorous validation of AI-generated artifacts in any evidence-based domain."}

This work introduces a diagnostic framework for expert systems that not only evaluates but also facilitates the transfer of expert behaviour into LLM-powered agents. The framework integrates (i) curated golden datasets of expert annotations, (ii) silver datasets generated through controlled behavioural mutation, and (iii) an LLM-based Agent Judge that scores and prescribes targeted improvements. These prescriptions are embedded into a vectorized recommendation map, allowing expert interventions to propagate as reusable improvement trajectories across multiple system instances.

FragmentRetro recursively combines molecular fragments and verifies their presence in a building block set, providing sets of fragment combinations as retrosynthetic solutions. We present the first formal computational analysis of retrosynthetic methods, showing that tree search exhibits exponential complexity $O(b^h)$, DirectMultiStep scales as $O(h^6)$, and FragmentRetro achieves $O(h^2)$, where $h$ represents the number of heavy atoms in the target molecule and $b$ is the branching factor for tree search. Evaluations on PaRoutes, USPTO-190, and natural products demonstrate that FragmentRetro achieves high solved rates with competitive runtime, including cases where tree search fails. The method benefits from fingerprint screening, which significantly reduces substructure matching complexity.

Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its misaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires different strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing anti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme on far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming is driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to pre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" -- such as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as a proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then stress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26 OOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert action rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our mitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal previously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after additional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often demonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal evidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness increases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in covert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness. While we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational awareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to rely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard English. We encourage research into alignment mitigations for scheming and their assessment, especially for the adversarial case of deceptive alignment, which this paper does not address."}

Rule-based systems offer high interpretability, deterministic behavior, and ease of implementation in stable environments, making them ideal for regulated industries and safety-critical applications.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration between LLMs and external tools.Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP can autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital setting.Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated with the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct agent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the infection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were retrospectively analyzed. Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was measured.Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools. Except for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy. Performance was lower in the complex task requiring time-dependent calculations. Most errors arose from incorrect arguments or misinterpretation of tool results. Responses from EHR-MCP were reliable, though long and repetitive data risked exceeding the context window.Conclusions: LLMs can retrieve clinical data from an EHR via MCP tools in a real hospital setting, achieving near-perfect performance in simple tasks while highlighting challenges in complex ones.

However, their static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands -- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by privacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches, including retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often computationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or continuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift: rethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in capability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies knowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than encoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics to dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by removing the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or access to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves predictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten ones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security guarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal prevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions. This ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against unauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for deployment in sensitive and regulated environments. Overall, by embedding removability into the architecture itself, this work establishes a new foundation for designing modular, scalable and ethically responsive AI models."}

Our method uses text or images to guide object placement and layout in 3D scenes, with 3D Gaussian Splatting and Score Distillation Sampling improving shape accuracy and rendering stability. Extensive experiments show that CausalStruct generates 3D scenes with enhanced logical coherence, realistic spatial interactions, and robust adaptability."}

Plummer,Margrit Betke", "title": "Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning", "abstract": "Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges. For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering, we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS."}

We evaluate combinations of data curation on a controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image generation.

Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision.

Motion retargeting is a crucial step in enabling robots to acquire reference trajectories when exploring locomotion skills. However, current methods focus on motion retargeting frame by frame, which lacks scalability. Could we directly convert large-scale human motion into robot-executable motion through a more efficient approach? To address this issue, we propose Implicit Kinodynamic Motion Retargeting (IKMR), a novel efficient and scalable retargeting framework that considers both kinematics and dynamics. In kinematics, IKMR pretrains motion topology feature representation and a dual encoder-decoder architecture to learn a motion domain mapping. In dynamics, IKMR integrates imitation learning with the motion retargeting network to refine motion into physically feasible trajectories. After fine-tuning using the tracking results, IKMR can achieve large-scale physically feasible motion retargeting in real time, and a whole-body controller could be directly trained and deployed for tracking its retargeted trajectories. We conduct our experiments both in the simulator and the real robot on a full-size humanoid robot. Extensive experiments and evaluation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework."}

In Phase 1, PILOT translates natural language persona descriptions into multidimensional profiles with normalized scores across linguistic and psychological dimensions. In Phase 2, these profiles guide generation along measurable axes of variation. We evaluate PILOT across three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral Large 2, Deepseek-R1, LLaMA 3.3 70B) using 25 synthetic personas under three conditions: Natural-language Persona Steering (NPS), Schema-Based Steering (SBS), and Hybrid Persona-Schema Steering (HPS). Results demonstrate that schema-based approaches significantly reduce artificial-sounding persona repetition while improving output coherence, with silhouette scores increasing from 0.098 to 0.237 and topic purity from 0.773 to 0.957. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: SBS produces more concise outputs with higher topical consistency, while NPS offers greater lexical diversity but reduced predictability. HPS achieves a balance between these extremes, maintaining output variety while preserving structural consistency. Expert linguistic evaluation confirms that PILOT maintains high response quality across all conditions, with no statistically significant differences between steering approaches."}

While originally proposed for the language data, they quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities with various signal geometries. Despite this versatility, generalizing the attention mechanism to scenarios where data is presented at different scales from potentially different modalities is not straightforward. The attempts to incorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based on ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar problems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a mathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data. We then mathematically derive the neural attention mechanics for the proposed construct from the first principle of entropy minimization. We show that the derived formulation is optimal in the sense of being the closest to the standard Softmax attention while incorporating the inductive biases originating from the hierarchical/geometric information of the problem. We further propose an efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to compute our derived attention mechanism. By incorporating it within transformers, we show that the proposed hierarchical attention mechanism not only can be employed to train transformer models in hierarchical/multi-modal settings from scratch, but it can also be used to inject hierarchical information into classical, pre-trained transformer models post training, resulting in more efficient models in zero-shot manner."}

However, in the mammalian visual system, there are connections within each visual cortical area, known as lateral (or horizontal) connections. These would roughly correspond to connections within CNN feature maps, and this important architectural feature is missing in current CNN models. In this paper, we present how such lateral connections can be modeled within the standard CNN framework, and test its benefits and analyze its emergent properties in relation to the biological visual system. We will focus on two main architectural features of lateral connections: (1) recurrent activation and (2) separation of excitatory and inhibitory connections. We show that recurrent CNN using weight sharing is equivalent to lateral connections, and propose a custom loss function to separate excitatory and inhibitory weights. The addition of these two leads to increased classification accuracy, and importantly, the activation properties and connection properties of the resulting model show properties similar to those observed in the biological visual system.

The models analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures, whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models.

To answer this question, we contribute a systematic comparison between human and machine-generated slang usages. Our evaluative framework focuses on three core aspects: 1) Characteristics of the usages that reflect systematic biases in how machines perceive slang, 2) Creativity reflected by both lexical coinages and word reuses employed by the slang usages, and 3) Informativeness of the slang usages when used as gold-standard examples for model distillation. By comparing human-attested slang usages from the Online Slang Dictionary (OSD) and slang generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3, we find significant biases in how LLMs perceive slang.

We first present a novel perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed. The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones.

In the first stage, heuristic trajectory sampling cluster (HTSC) is generated in the Frenet coordinate system using third-order interpolation with fifth-order polynomials and momentum-constrained trajectory optimization (MTO) constraints to ensure smoothness and feasibility. After first stage cost evaluation, the second stage leverages a residual-enhanced actor-critic network with LSTM-based temporal feature modeling to adaptively refine trajectory selection in the Cartesian coordinate system. A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with weight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages, supporting human-centered optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-ResB-PPO achieves significantly faster convergence, attaining stable policy performance in approximately half the training iterations required by the PPO baseline, while simultaneously enhancing both reward outcomes and training stability. Compared to baseline method, the selected model reduces average cost and cost variance by 30.3% and 53.3%, and lowers ego and obstacle risks by over 77%. These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in enhancing robustness, safety, and real-time feasibility in complex assistive planning tasks."}

In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10.

The proposed \"Chunk Knowledge Generation Model\" adopts a T5-based multi-task learning structure that simultaneously generates titles and candidate questions from each document chunk while extracting keywords from user queries.

To circumvent this data and modality gap, we present SightSound-R1, a cross-modal distillation framework that transfers advanced reasoning from a stronger LVLM teacher to a weaker LALM student on the same audio-visual question answering (AVQA) dataset. SightSound-R1 consists of three core steps: (i) test-time scaling to generate audio-focused chains of thought (CoT) from an LVLM teacher, (ii) audio-grounded validation to filter hallucinations, and (iii) a distillation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for the LALM student.

The system has a compact, locally deployed model, which is supplemented by a larger, remote model, which is accessible via the network by incurring an offloading cost. For each sample, our system first uses the locally deployed model for inference. Based on the output of the local model, the sample may be offloaded to the remote model. This work aims to understand the fundamental trade-off between classification accuracy and these offloading costs within such a hierarchical inference (HI) system. To optimize this system, we propose an online learning framework that continuously adapts a pair of thresholds on the local model's confidence scores. These thresholds determine the prediction of the local model and whether a sample is classified locally or offloaded to the remote model. We present a closed-form solution for the setting where the local model is calibrated. For the more general case of uncalibrated models, we introduce H2T2, an online two-threshold hierarchical inference policy, and prove it achieves sublinear regret. H2T2 is model-agnostic, requires no training, and learns in the inference phase using limited feedback. Simulations on real-world datasets show that H2T2 consistently outperforms naive and single-threshold HI policies, sometimes even surpassing offline optima. The policy also demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts and adapts effectively to mismatched classifiers."}

However, given the limited context size of LLMs, a fundamental question arises: Which examples should be selected to maximize performance on a given user query? While nearest-neighbor-based methods like KATE have been widely adopted for this purpose, they suffer from well-known drawbacks in high-dimensional embedding spaces, including poor generalization and a lack of diversity. In this work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled, information theory-driven perspective. We first model an LLM as a linear function over input embeddings and frame the example selection task as a query-specific optimization problem: selecting a subset of exemplars from a larger example bank that minimizes the prediction error on a specific query. This formulation departs from traditional generalization-focused learning theoretic approaches by targeting accurate prediction for a specific query instance. We derive a principled surrogate objective that is approximately submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm with an approximation guarantee. We further enhance our method by (i) incorporating the kernel trick to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit mappings, and (ii) introducing an optimal design-based regularizer to encourage diversity in the selected examples. Empirically, we demonstrate significant improvements over standard retrieval methods across a suite of classification tasks, highlighting the benefits of structure-aware, diverse example selection for ICL in real-world, label-scarce scenarios."}

In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map, from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while consistently outperforming our baseline encoder."}

We define a distribution as ideal if the minimizer of any cost-sensitive risk on it is guaranteed to have exact group-fair outcomes (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity)-in other words, it has no fairness-utility trade-off. We formulate an optimization program for optimal steering by finding the nearest ideal distribution in KL-divergence, and provide efficient algorithms for it when the underlying distributions come from well-known parametric families (e.g., normal, log-normal).

Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global deformation field.

Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs is well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the MetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited in diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance generation approach, termed as \\textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse training problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies. LSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features into a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space leads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity. By leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with minimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a diversified problem set, termed as \\textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the effectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe their generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios. Extensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to existing training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only demonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal interesting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization."}

First, most existing dynamic GNN methods are built on temporally fixed static graphs, which fail to reflect the evolving nature of brain connectivity during seizure progression. Second, current efforts to jointly model temporal signals and graph structures and, more importantly, their interactions remain nascent, often resulting in inconsistent performance. To address these challenges, we present the first theoretical analysis of these two problems, demonstrating the effectiveness and necessity of explicit dynamic modeling and time-then-graph dynamic GNN method.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end pipeline.

Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence refinement, and pose estimation.

Building on this view, we introduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVD), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and theoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and extract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence gradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained models. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to steer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We theoretically prove that SVD is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of full fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the steering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVD paired with four standard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 points and open-ended truthfulness by 2 points, with similar gains (1-2 points) on commonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT adapter.

Even approaches aiming for geometric fidelity often result in too smooth meshes due to the ill-posedness of the problem. We present a novel framework for highly detailed dynamic reconstruction that extends the static 3D reconstruction method NeuralAngelo to work in dynamic settings. To that end, we start with a high-quality template scene reconstruction from the initial frame using NeuralAngelo, and then jointly optimize deformation fields that track the template and refine it based on the temporal sequence. This flexible template allows updating the geometry to include changes that cannot be modeled with the deformation field, for instance occluded parts or the changes in the topology.

To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is built atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow transformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level, easy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and recomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's adaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic pipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling policy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving 1.1x-2.13x speedup in end-to-end training throughput."}

More in detail, we investigate well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity.

This enables the synthesis of permutation circuits on any topology that can be embedded within the rectangular lattice, without the need to re-train the model. In this paper we show results for 5x5 lattice and compare them to previous AI topology-oriented models and classical methods, showing that they outperform classical heuristics, and match previous specialized AI models, and performs synthesis even for topologies that were not seen during training.

This paper introduces G-WindCast, a novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear, and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind dynamics.

To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository generation from scratch.

To ensure this alignment, a naive solution would be to retrain the agent using a reward function that encodes the user's specific preferences. However, such a reward function is typically not readily available, and as such, retraining the agent from scratch can be prohibitively expensive. We propose a more practical approach - to adapt the already trained policy to user-specific needs with the help of human feedback. To this end, we infer the user's intent through trajectory-level feedback and combine it with the trained task policy via a theoretically grounded dynamic policy fusion approach. As our approach collects human feedback on the very same trajectories used to learn the task policy, it does not require any additional interactions with the environment, making it a zero-shot approach. We empirically demonstrate in a number of environments that our proposed dynamic policy fusion approach consistently achieves the intended task while simultaneously adhering to user-specific needs."}

On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers.

We develop a mathematical approach that systematically quantifies how causal power is distributed among variables in a system, using a recently derived closed-form expression for the Möbius function of the redundancy lattice. The formalism is then illustrated by decomposing the causal power in logic gates, cellular automata, chemical reaction networks, and a transformer language model. Our results reveal how the distribution of causal power can be context- and parameter-dependent. The decomposition provides new insights into complex systems by revealing how causal influences are shared and combined among multiple variables, with potential applications ranging from attribution of responsibility in legal or AI systems, to the analysis of biological networks or climate models."}

While the \"personification\" enhances human experiences of interactivity and adaptability of LLMs, it gives rise to critical concerns about content safety, particularly regarding bias, sentiment and toxicity of LLM generation. This study explores how assigning different personality traits to LLMs affects the toxicity and biases of their outputs. Leveraging the widely accepted HEXACO personality framework developed in social psychology, we design experimentally sound prompts to test three LLMs' performance on three toxic and bias benchmarks. The findings demonstrate the sensitivity of all three models to HEXACO personality traits and, more importantly, a consistent variation in the biases, negative sentiment and toxicity of their output. In particular, adjusting the levels of several personality traits can effectively reduce bias and toxicity in model performance, similar to humans' correlations between personality traits and toxic behaviors. The findings highlight the additional need to examine content safety besides the efficiency of training or fine-tuning methods for LLM personification. They also suggest a potential for the adjustment of personalities to be a simple and low-cost method to conduct controlled text generation."}

However, in practical settings, the generative model is often learned from limited data, introducing approximation errors that can degrade performance or lead to unsafe behaviors. To address these challenges, Robust MDPs (RMDPs) offer a principled framework for planning under model uncertainty, yet existing approaches are typically computationally intensive and not suited for real-time use. In this work, we introduce Robust Sparse Sampling (RSS), the first online planning algorithm for RMDPs with finite-sample theoretical performance guarantees. Unlike Sparse Sampling, which estimates the nominal value function, RSS computes a robust value function by leveraging the efficiency and theoretical properties of Sample Average Approximation (SAA), enabling tractable robust policy computation in online settings.

We propose the GraphSTAD system, which employs convolutional and graph neural networks to learn local spatial characteristics induced by particles traversing the detector and the global behavior owing to shared backend circuit connections and housing boxes of the channels, respectively. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal evolution of the extracted spatial features. We validate the accuracy of the proposed AD system in capturing diverse channel fault types using the LHC collision data sets. The GraphSTAD system achieves production-level accuracy and is being integrated into the CMS core production system for real-time monitoring of the HCAL. We provide a quantitative performance comparison with alternative benchmark models to demonstrate the promising leverage of the presented system. Code:this https URL."}

Building on this insight and prior work, we theoretically introduce a novel likelihood-based evaluation metric BBScoreV2. Empirically, we demonstrate that the stochastic latent space induces a \"clustered-to-temporal ordered\" mapping of language model representations in high-dimensional space, offering both intuitive and quantitative support for the effectiveness of BBScoreV2.

Discovering informative representations of normal samples is crucial to detecting anomalies effectively. Recent self-supervised methods have successfully learned such representations by employing prior knowledge about anomalies to create synthetic outliers during training. However, we often do not know what to expect from unseen data in specialized real-world applications. In this work, we address this limitation with our new approach Con$_2$, which leverages prior knowledge about symmetries in normal samples to observe the data in different contexts. Con$_2$ consists of two parts: Context Contrasting clusters representations according to their context, while Content Alignment encourages the model to capture semantic information by aligning the positions of normal samples across clusters. The resulting representation space allows us to detect anomalies as outliers of the learned context clusters. We demonstrate the benefit of this approach in extensive experiments on specialized medical datasets, outperforming competitive baselines based on self-supervised learning and pretrained models and presenting competitive performance on natural imaging benchmarks."}

To tackle this, previous studies have proposed expanding the query with a couple of additional (user-related) features related to it. However, they may be suboptimal to effectively augment the query, and there is plenty of other information available to augment it in a relational database. Motivated by this fact, we present a novel retrieval framework called Database-Augmented Query representation (DAQu), which augments the original query with various (query-related) metadata across multiple tables. In addition, as the number of features in the metadata can be very large and there is no order among them, we encode them with the graph-based set-encoding strategy, which considers hierarchies of features in the database without order. We validate our DAQu in diverse retrieval scenarios, demonstrating that it significantly enhances overall retrieval performance over relevant baselines."}

However, these oversee affine transformations which may represent better the changes in the images actually happening in natural conditions. Humans can be particularly invariant to these natural transformations, as opposed to the digital ones.In this work, we propose a methodology to evaluate any image quality metric by assessing their invariance to affine transformations, specifically: rotation, translation, scaling, and changes in spectral illumination. Here, invariance refers to the fact that certain distances should be neglected if their values are below a threshold. This is what we call invisibility threshold of a metric. Our methodology consists of two elements: (1) the determination of a visibility threshold in a subjective representation common to every metric, and (2) a transduction from the distance values of the metric and this common representation. This common representation is based on subjective ratings of readily available image quality databases. We determine the threshold in such common representation (the first element) using accurate psychophysics. Then, the transduction (the second element) can be trivially fitted for any metric: with the provided threshold extension of the method to any metric is straightforward. We test our methodology with some well-established metrics and find that none of them show human-like invisibility thresholds.This means that tuning the models exclusively to predict the visibility of generic distortions may disregard other properties of human vision as for instance invariances or invisibility thresholds. The data and code are publicly available to test other metrics."}

Cooperative driving leverages the connectivity ability of CAVs to achieve synergies greater than the sum of their parts, making it a promising approach to improving CAV performance in complex scenarios. However, the lack of interaction and continuous learning ability limits current cooperative driving to single-scenario applications and specific Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA). To address these challenges, this paper proposes CoDrivingLLM, an interactive and learnable LLM-driven cooperative driving framework, to achieve all-scenario and all-CDA. First, since Large Language Models(LLMs) are not adept at handling mathematical calculations, an environment module is introduced to update vehicle positions based on semantic decisions, thus avoiding potential errors from direct LLM control of vehicle positions. Second, based on the four levels of CDA defined by the SAE J3216 standard, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (COT) based reasoning module that includes state perception, intent sharing, negotiation, and decision-making, enhancing the stability of LLMs in multi-step reasoning tasks. Centralized conflict resolution is then managed through a conflict coordinator in the reasoning process. Finally, by introducing a memory module and employing retrieval-augmented generation, CAVs are endowed with the ability to learn from their past experiences. We validate the proposed CoDrivingLLM through ablation experiments on the negotiation module, reasoning with different shots experience, and comparison with other cooperative driving methods."}

Specifically, it utilizes a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topologies. Building upon this, DiRW incorporates a node-wise learnable path aggregator for generalized node representations.

The standard training procedure for CBMs is to predefine a candidate set of human-interpretable concepts, extract their values from the training data, and identify a sparse subset as inputs to a transparent prediction model. However, such approaches are often hampered by the tradeoff between exploring a sufficiently large set of concepts versus controlling the cost of obtaining concept extractions, resulting in a large interpretability-accuracy tradeoff. This work investigates a novel approach that sidesteps these challenges: BC-LLM iteratively searches over a potentially infinite set of concepts within a Bayesian framework, in which Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as both a concept extraction mechanism and prior. Even though LLMs can be miscalibrated and hallucinate, we prove that BC-LLM can provide rigorous statistical inference and uncertainty quantification.

Further, we observe that once LLMs generate incorrect tokens early on, there is a higher likelihood that subsequent tokens will also be factually incorrect. To this end, in this work, we propose Streaming-VR (Streaming Verification and Refinement), a novel approach designed to enhance the efficiency of verification and refinement of LLM outputs. Specifically, the proposed Streaming-VR enables on-the-fly verification and correction of tokens as they are being generated, similar to a streaming process, ensuring that each subset of tokens is checked and refined in real-time by another LLM as the LLM constructs its response.

In this paper, we explore the use of small neural networks -- which we refer to as the InfluenceNetwork -- to estimate influence values, achieving up to 99% cost reduction. Our evaluation demonstrates that influence values can be estimated with models just 0.0027% the size of full language models (we use 7B and 8B versions). We apply our algorithm of estimating influence values (called NN-CIFT: Neural Networks for effiCient Instruction Fine-Tuning) to the downstream task of subset selection for general instruction fine-tuning. In our study, we include four state-of-the-art influence functions and show no compromise in performance, despite large speedups, between NN-CIFT and the original influence functions. We provide an in-depth hyperparameter analyses of NN-CIFT. The code for our method can be found here:this https URL."}

Ramamurthy", "title": "Sparsity May Be All You Need: Sparse Random Parameter Adaptation", "abstract": "Full fine-tuning of large language models for alignment and task adaptation has become prohibitively expensive as models have grown in size. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods aim at significantly reducing the computational and memory resources needed for fine-tuning these models by only training on a small number of parameters instead of all model parameters. Currently, the most popular PEFT method is the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which freezes the parameters of the model and introduces a small set of trainable parameters in the form of low-rank matrices. We propose simply reducing the number of trainable parameters by randomly selecting a small proportion of the model parameters to train on, while fixing all other parameters, without any additional prior assumptions such as low-rank structures. In this paper, we compare the efficiency and performance of our proposed approach to other PEFT methods as well as full parameter fine-tuning. We find our method to be competitive with LoRA when using a similar number of trainable parameters. Our findings suggest that what truly matters for a PEFT technique to perform well is not necessarily the specific adapter structure, but rather the number of trainable parameters being used."}

As CLIP is increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is becoming even more critical to understand its limitations and embedded social biases to mitigate potentially harmful downstream consequences. However, the question of what internal mechanisms drive both the impressive capabilities as well as problematic shortcomings of CLIP has largely remained unanswered. To bridge this gap, we study the conceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we propose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that measures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with specific concepts. Our soft-pruning experiments reveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as pruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning random or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential concepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific reasoning, and video-language understanding. Moreover, we prove that high CCS heads learn spurious correlations which amplify social biases. These results position CCS as a powerful interpretability metric exposing the paradox of performance and social biases in CLIP models."}

We build upon the concept of temporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the dynamics of the system, ensuring meaningful relationships between dynamic states.

To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference.

Through a semi-structured interview study (N=11), we map the RS practitioner workflow within large technology companies, focusing on how technical teams consider fairness internally and in collaboration with other (legal, data, and fairness) teams. We identify key challenges to incorporating fairness into existing RS workflows: defining fairness in RS contexts, particularly when navigating multi-stakeholder and dynamic fairness considerations. We also identify key organization-wide challenges: making time for fairness work and facilitating cross-team communication.

Current approaches rely on contrastive learning, which are shown to be effective on distinguishing hate and non-hate sentences. Humans, however, detect implicit hate speech by first identifying specific targets within the text and subsequently interpreting how these target relate to their surrounding context. Motivated by this reasoning process, we propose AmpleHate, a novel approach designed to mirror human inference for implicit hate detection. AmpleHate identifies explicit target using a pretrained Named Entity Recognition model and capture implicit target information via [CLS] tokens. It computes attention-based relationships between explicit, implicit targets and sentence context and then, directly injects these relational vectors into the final sentence representation. This amplifies the critical signals of target-context relations for determining implicit hate. Experiments demonstrate that AmpleHate achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming contrastive learning baselines by an average of 82.14% and achieve faster convergence.

In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in the future."}

Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder.

Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning. Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data."}

Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates.

To address this gap, we explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at their respective key layers.

This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework specifically designed to capture the complexity of features in LLMs. Unlike approaches that assign a single description per neuron, common in many automated interpretability methods in NLP, PRISM produces more nuanced descriptions that account for both monosemantic and polysemantic behavior. We apply PRISM to LLMs and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score)."}

This vision includes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human collaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional Interactive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the language they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language understanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with robots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem.In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that work closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better collaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system with a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts with both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its experiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three specific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and present a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each. Finally, we discuss what it will take to turn these simple experiments into an operational system where LLM-assisted language understanding is a part of an integrated robotic assistant that uses language to collaborate with humans."}

The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed \"language\", albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask: (i) Can a small LM represent the \"language of browsing\" better than a large LM? (ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences? (iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved alignment."}

However, the inclusion of excessive retrieved documents substantially increases the input length, leading to higher computational costs. Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved documents into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods often compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression targets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot guarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task. To address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method designed to achieve lossless context compression for RAG. CORE employs reinforcement learning to optimize the compression process without relying on predefined compression labels, which enables the compressor to generate summaries that maximize the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. With a high compression ratio of 3\\%, our method not only avoids performance degradation compared to prepending full documents across all datasets but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points.

In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale.

Existing AI for software engineering leaderboards (e.g., SWE-bench) focus solely on solution accuracy, ignoring the crucial factor of effectiveness in a resource-constrained world. This is a universal problem that also exists beyond software engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must also be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of new metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness scores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome (e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time). In this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by re-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench benchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics. We found that AI system's effectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself, but on how well it integrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in a resource-efficient manner. We also identified systematic challenges such as the \"token snowball\" effect and, more significantly, a pattern of \"expensive failures\". In these cases, agents consume excessive resources while stuck on unsolvable tasks - an issue that not only limits practical deployment but also drives up the cost of failed rollouts during RL training. Lastly, we observed a clear trade-off between effectiveness under the token budget and effectiveness under the time budget, which plays a crucial role in managing project budgets and enabling scalable reinforcement learning, where fast responses are essential."}

While gray-box approaches leverage selective \"structural knowledge\" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them \"structural aspects\"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of \"opportunities\" for improved \"modular performance modeling\". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling \"hardness\", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an \"analytical matrix\" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role.

Our framework incorporates a Process Reward Model that automatically generates fine-grained rewards through subgoal progress, redundancy detection, and action verification. Additionally, a dynamic weighting mechanism prioritizes high-impact decision points during training. Experiments on Online-Mind2Web and our self-constructed C-WebShop datasets demonstrate that TGPO significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher success rates with fewer redundant steps."}

Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 40.2% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.28 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D.. In downstream applications, AToken enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization."}

A STRIDE-driven threat model and attack-tree analysis guide the design. At startup, each boot stage is measured into TPM PCRs.

In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent Identification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field Control (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task of selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case adversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems are coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we first decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform, resulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that enables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational complexity. We then reformulate the upper-level combinatorial problem as a MDP with dense rewards from our regularized mean-field Bellman operator, enabling us to sequentially identify the most vulnerable agents by greedy and RL algorithms. This decomposition provably preserves the optimal solution of the original HAD-MFC.

We propose BiRQ, a bilevel SSL framework that combines the efficiency of BEST-RQ with the refinement benefits of HuBERT-style label enhancement. The key idea is to reuse part of the model itself as a pseudo-label generator: intermediate representations are discretized by a random-projection quantizer to produce enhanced labels, while anchoring labels derived directly from the raw input stabilize training and prevent collapse.

Results show significant differences in vulnerability across models and modalities. Pixtral 12B exhibited the highest rate of harmful responses (~62%), while Claude Sonnet 3.5 was the most resistant (~10%). Contrary to expectations, text-only prompts were slightly more effective at bypassing safety mechanisms than multimodal ones. Statistical analysis confirmed that both model type and input modality were significant predictors of harmfulness. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust, multimodal safety benchmarks as MLLMs are deployed more widely."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), however, have made the problem more approachable. While LLM agents are becoming more widely applied to intermediary tasks such as slang detection and slang interpretation, their generalizability and reliability are heavily dependent on whether these models have captured structural knowledge about slang that align well with human attested slang usages. To answer this question, we contribute a systematic comparison between human and machine-generated slang usages. Our evaluative framework focuses on three core aspects: 1) Characteristics of the usages that reflect systematic biases in how machines perceive slang, 2) Creativity reflected by both lexical coinages and word reuses employed by the slang usages, and 3) Informativeness of the slang usages when used as gold-standard examples for model distillation. By comparing human-attested slang usages from the Online Slang Dictionary (OSD) and slang generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3, we find significant biases in how LLMs perceive slang. Our results suggest that while LLMs have captured significant knowledge about the creative aspects of slang, such knowledge does not align with humans sufficiently to enable LLMs for extrapolative tasks such as linguistic analyses."}

This paper introduces Climb (Cross-Lingual Interaction-aware Multilingual Balancing), a novel framework designed to systematically optimize multilingual data allocation. At its core, Climb introduces a cross-lingual interaction-aware language ratio, explicitly quantifying each language's effective allocation by capturing inter-language dependencies.

Or does language play a more transformative role in human cognition, allowing us to have thoughts that we otherwise could (or would) not have? Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science have reinvigorated this old question. We argue that language may hold the key to the emergence of both more general AI systems and central aspects of human intelligence. We highlight two related properties of language that make it such a powerful tool for developing domain--general abilities. First, language offers compact representations that make it easier to represent and reason about many abstract concepts (e.g., exact numerosity). Second, these compressed representations are the iterated output of collective minds. In learning a language, we learn a treasure trove of culturally evolved abstractions. Taken together, these properties mean that a sufficiently powerful learning system exposed to language--whether biological or artificial--learns a compressed model of the world, reverse engineering many of the conceptual and causal structures that support human (and human-like) thought."}

One of the primary factors behind the advancement of speech technology is self-supervised learning. Most self-supervised learning algorithms are designed with full utterance assumption and compromises have to made if partial utterances are presented, which are common in the streaming applications. In this work, we propose a chunk based self-supervised learning (Chunk SSL) algorithm as an unified solution for both streaming and offline speech pre-training. Chunk SSL is optimized with the masked prediction loss and an acoustic encoder is encouraged to restore indices of those masked speech frames with help from unmasked frames in the same chunk and preceding chunks. A copy and append data augmentation approach is proposed to conduct efficient chunk based pre-training. Chunk SSL utilizes a finite scalar quantization (FSQ) module to discretize input speech features and our study shows a high resolution FSQ codebook, i.e., a codebook with vocabulary size up to a few millions, is beneficial to transfer knowledge from the pre-training task to the downstream tasks. A group masked prediction loss is employed during pre-training to alleviate the high memory and computation cost introduced by the large codebook. The proposed approach is examined in two speech to text tasks, i.e., speech recognition and speech translation. Experimental results on the \\textsc{Librispeech} and \\textsc{Must-C} datasets show that the proposed method could achieve very competitive results for speech to text tasks at both streaming and offline modes."}

To address this limitation, we introduce Concept Unlearning (CU) as a new requirement for LLM unlearning. We leverage knowledge graphs to represent the LLM's internal knowledge and define CU as removing the forgetting target nodes and associated edges. This graph-based formulation enables a more intuitive unlearning and facilitates the design of more effective methods.

Many existing unlearning methods aim to suppress undesirable outputs through additional training (e.g., gradient ascent), which reduces the probability of generating such outputs. While such suppression-based approaches can control model outputs, they may not eliminate the underlying knowledge embedded in the model's internal activations; muting a response is not the same as forgetting it. Moreover, such suppression-based methods often suffer from model collapse. To address these issues, we propose a novel unlearning method that directly intervenes in the model's internal activations. In our formulation, forgetting is defined as a state in which the activation of a forgotten target is indistinguishable from that of ``unknown'' entities. Our method introduces an unlearning objective that modifies the activation of the target entity away from those of known entities and toward those of unknown entities in a sparse autoencoder latent space. By aligning the target's internal activation with those of unknown entities, we shift the model's recognition of the target entity from ``known'' to ``unknown'', achieving genuine forgetting while avoiding over-suppression and model collapse. Empirically, we show that our method effectively aligns the internal activations of the forgotten target, a result that the suppression-based approaches do not reliably achieve. Additionally, our method effectively reduces the model's recall of target knowledge in question-answering tasks without significant damage to the non-target knowledge."}

We then apply targeted clustering analyses to probe for phonetic vs. semantic discriminability in model representations. Speech-based representations remain phonetically dominated with visual grounding, but in contrast to text-based representations, visual grounding does not improve semantic discriminability. Our findings could usefully inform the development of more efficient methods to enrich speech-based models with visually-informed semantics."}

Building on this view, we introduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVD), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and theoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and extract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence gradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained models. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to steer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We theoretically prove that SVD is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of full fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the steering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVD paired with four standard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 points and open-ended truthfulness by 2 points, with similar gains (1-2 points) on commonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT adapter.

As we prove, while the convex hull of the token states still converges to a convex polytope, its structure can no longer be fully described by a maximal alignment set, prompting the introduction of quiescent sets to capture the invariant behavior of tokens near vertices. We show that these sets play a key role in understanding the asymptotic behavior of the system, even under time-varying alignment sensitivity parameters. We further show that localmax dynamics does not exhibit finite-time convergence and provide results for vanishing, nonzero, time-varying alignment-sensitivity parameters, recovering the limiting behavior of hardmax as a by-product.

To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository generation from scratch.

Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning when training solely on target model outputs.

We prepared eleven retrieval models employing four training approaches: monolingual, cross-lingual, translate-train-all, and a novel mixed method combining cross-lingual and monolingual techniques. Evaluation on an in-domain dataset demonstrates that the mixed approach achieves promising results across diverse retrieval scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of how different training configurations affect the embedding space and their implications for multilingual retrieval effectiveness. Finally, we discuss deployment considerations, emphasizing the cost-efficiency of deploying a single versatile, lightweight model for real-world MLIR applications."}

Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition, which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically, low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal interaction at both local and global representations of image information. Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding, 0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis.

However, given the limited context size of LLMs, a fundamental question arises: Which examples should be selected to maximize performance on a given user query? While nearest-neighbor-based methods like KATE have been widely adopted for this purpose, they suffer from well-known drawbacks in high-dimensional embedding spaces, including poor generalization and a lack of diversity. In this work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled, information theory-driven perspective. We first model an LLM as a linear function over input embeddings and frame the example selection task as a query-specific optimization problem: selecting a subset of exemplars from a larger example bank that minimizes the prediction error on a specific query. This formulation departs from traditional generalization-focused learning theoretic approaches by targeting accurate prediction for a specific query instance. We derive a principled surrogate objective that is approximately submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm with an approximation guarantee. We further enhance our method by (i) incorporating the kernel trick to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit mappings, and (ii) introducing an optimal design-based regularizer to encourage diversity in the selected examples. Empirically, we demonstrate significant improvements over standard retrieval methods across a suite of classification tasks, highlighting the benefits of structure-aware, diverse example selection for ICL in real-world, label-scarce scenarios."}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration between LLMs and external tools.Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP can autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital setting.Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated with the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct agent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the infection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were retrospectively analyzed. Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was measured.Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools. Except for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy. Performance was lower in the complex task requiring time-dependent calculations. Most errors arose from incorrect arguments or misinterpretation of tool results. Responses from EHR-MCP were reliable, though long and repetitive data risked exceeding the context window.Conclusions: LLMs can retrieve clinical data from an EHR via MCP tools in a real hospital setting, achieving near-perfect performance in simple tasks while highlighting challenges in complex ones. EHR-MCP provides an infrastructure for secure, consistent data access and may serve as a foundation for hospital AI agents.

We show how this perspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling to new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive science points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these issues.

Further, we observe that once LLMs generate incorrect tokens early on, there is a higher likelihood that subsequent tokens will also be factually incorrect. To this end, in this work, we propose Streaming-VR (Streaming Verification and Refinement), a novel approach designed to enhance the efficiency of verification and refinement of LLM outputs.

However, challenges remain when using LLMs for generating ML libraries using ASPLs because 1) this task is complicated even for experienced human programmers and 2) there are limited code examples because of the esoteric and evolving nature of ASPLs. Therefore, LLMs need complex reasoning with limited data in order to complete this task. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive self-improvement agentic system.

We argue that identifying the boundary between fact and fair is essential for meaningful fairness evaluation. We introduce Fact-or-Fair, a benchmark with (i) objective queries aligned with descriptive, fact-based judgments, and (ii) subjective queries aligned with normative, fairness-based judgments.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods aim at significantly reducing the computational and memory resources needed for fine-tuning these models by only training on a small number of parameters instead of all model parameters. Currently, the most popular PEFT method is the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which freezes the parameters of the model and introduces a small set of trainable parameters in the form of low-rank matrices. We propose simply reducing the number of trainable parameters by randomly selecting a small proportion of the model parameters to train on, while fixing all other parameters, without any additional prior assumptions such as low-rank structures. In this paper, we compare the efficiency and performance of our proposed approach to other PEFT methods as well as full parameter fine-tuning. We find our method to be competitive with LoRA when using a similar number of trainable parameters.

Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) struggles to address these issues, as it rigidly trains models on single gold-standard responses without modeling nuanced strategy trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Strategy Optimization (CSO), a novel approach that optimizes strategy selection preferences at each dialogue turn. We first leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search to construct ESC-Pro, a high-quality preference dataset with turn-level strategy-response pairs. Training on ESC-Pro with CSO improves both strategy accuracy and bias mitigation, enabling LLMs to generate more empathetic and contextually appropriate responses.

In this work, we scrutinize the robustness of reward models and the extent of such overfitting. We build **reWordBench**, which systematically transforms reward model inputs in meaning- or ranking-preserving ways. We show that state-of-the-art reward models suffer from substantial performance degradation even with minor input transformations, sometimes dropping to significantly below-random accuracy, suggesting brittleness. To improve reward model robustness, we propose to explicitly train them to assign similar scores to paraphrases, and find that this approach also improves robustness to other distinct kinds of transformations.

Generative large language models trained to align with human goals have achieved high zero-shot performance across a wide variety of tasks. As of yet, it is unclear how well these models perform on biomedical relation extraction (RE). To address this knowledge gap, we explore patterns in the performance of OpenAI LLMs across a diverse sampling of RE tasks.Methods: We use OpenAI GPT-4-turbo and OpenAI's reasoning models o1 and GPT-OSS to conduct end-to-end RE experiments on seven datasets. We use the JSON generation capabilities of GPT models to generate structured output in two ways: (1) by defining an explicit schema describing the structure of relations, and (2) using a setting that infers the structure from the prompt language.Results: Our work is the first to study and compare the performance of the GPT-4, o1 and GPT-OSS for the end-to-end zero-shot biomedical RE task across a broad array of datasets. We found the zero-shot performances to be proximal to that of fine-tuned methods. The limitations of this approach are that it performs poorly on instances containing many relations and errs on the boundaries of textual mentions.Conclusion: LLMs exhibit promising zero-shot capabilities in complex biomedical RE tasks, offering competitive performance with reduced dataset curation costs and NLP modeling needs but with increased perpetual compute costs.

This study asks: How safe are current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions. Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs are more vulnerable to meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation, elevated vulnerability persists.

To address these limitations, we present HydraRAG, a training-free framework that unifies graph topology, document semantics, and source reliability to support deep, faithful reasoning in LLMs. HydraRAG handles multi-hop and multi-entity problems through agent-driven exploration that combines structured and unstructured retrieval, increasing both diversity and precision of evidence.

Current approaches rely on contrastive learning, which are shown to be effective on distinguishing hate and non-hate sentences.

Motivated by this reasoning process, we propose AmpleHate, a novel approach designed to mirror human inference for implicit hate detection. AmpleHate identifies explicit target using a pretrained Named Entity Recognition model and capture implicit target information via [CLS] tokens. It computes attention-based relationships between explicit, implicit targets and sentence context and then, directly injects these relational vectors into the final sentence representation. This amplifies the critical signals of target-context relations for determining implicit hate. Experiments demonstrate that AmpleHate achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming contrastive learning baselines by an average of 82.14% and achieve faster convergence.

When doing so, it is common practice to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in the future."}

Although these methods produce consistent estimates under theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions. First, we study how each methods performance scales with the number of expert annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in finite samples."}

Existing moderators mainly practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs, introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of 29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in responses on average.

However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain (IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains on widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines."}

However, in real-world settings, one often only has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated with attribution performance.

Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs without altering their original architectures or introducing significant computational overhead.

Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as the final text embedding.

However, the inclusion of excessive retrieved documents substantially increases the input length, leading to higher computational costs. Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved documents into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods often compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression targets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot guarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task. To address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method designed to achieve lossless context compression for RAG. CORE employs reinforcement learning to optimize the compression process without relying on predefined compression labels, which enables the compressor to generate summaries that maximize the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. With a high compression ratio of 3\\%, our method not only avoids performance degradation compared to prepending full documents across all datasets but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points.

Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions.

Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles.

Existing fine-tuning-based compression methods either operate post-hoc pruning, risking disruption to reasoning coherence, or rely on sampling-based selection, which fails to remove redundant content thoroughly. To address these limitations, this work begins by framing two key patterns of redundant reflection in LRMs--Confidence Deficit, wherein the model reflects on correct intermediate steps, and Termination Delay, where reflection continues after a verified, confident answer--through a confidence-guided perspective. Based on this, we introduce ConCISE (Confidence-guided Compression In Step-by-step Efficient Reasoning), a framework designed to generate concise reasoning chains, integrating Confidence Injection to boost reasoning confidence, and Early Stopping to terminate reasoning when confidence is sufficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to baseline methods, fine-tuning LRMs on ConCISE-generated data yields a better balance between compression and task performance, reducing length by up to approximately 50% under SimPO, while maintaining high task accuracy."}

This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework specifically designed to capture the complexity of features in LLMs. Unlike approaches that assign a single description per neuron, common in many automated interpretability methods in NLP, PRISM produces more nuanced descriptions that account for both monosemantic and polysemantic behavior.

Importance sampling is the standard tool for correcting this distribution mismatch, but large policy gaps lead to skewed weights, high variance, and unstable optimization. Existing methods mitigate this issue with KL penalties or clipping, which passively restrict updates rather than actively reducing the gap. We propose a simple yet effective data rewriting framework that proactively shrinks the policy gap before training. For each problem, correct model-generated solutions are kept as on-policy data, while incorrect ones are rewritten through guided re-solving, falling back to expert demonstrations only when needed. This aligns the training distribution with the target policy, reducing variance and improving stability. To handle residual mismatch after rewriting, we additionally apply importance sampling during training, forming a two-stage approach that combines data-level alignment with lightweight optimization-level correction.

Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts.

With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single, general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual content.

Thus, the inability to identify uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering, we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS."}

Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon acceptance."}

In this work, we investigate whether recently developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity. Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However, its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial."}

To address these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN- and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images, achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%.

Two pre-training objectives dominate the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting detailed findings on two widely-used datasets."}

Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision.

Having the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence.

However, existing pruning-based approaches often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \\emph{selection} mechanism to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an \\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation."}

To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition, which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically, low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal interaction at both local and global representations of image information. Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as emotion and sentiment recognition.

We first present a novel perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed. The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones.

Lee,Hongil Yoon", "title": "GS-Scale: Unlocking Large-Scale 3D Gaussian Splatting Training via Host Offloading", "abstract": "The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU, leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity) improvement."}

In this paper, we present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to effectively solve the proposed model.

In handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features. Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and is competitive with recent image generation networks."}

Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map, from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to eliminate redundancy.

To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling, which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2) CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context.

Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels. Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue, such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii) maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or domain labels during representation learning."}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method suitable for various tasks.

Open in-situ datasets from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models. Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps.

Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence refinement, and pose estimation.

Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work, we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC."}

Despite significant advancements in VSR over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon two key insights: (i) learning an initial \\textit{coarse} alignment between visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content facilitates the subsequent learning of \\textit{precise} visual-to-speech mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions, refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3 benchmarks.

Real-world point clouds are inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all of them both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding boxes.

To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do not fare well on AcT2I.

To address the problem, we propose a simple yet effective contrastive strategy named \\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{P}re-fixing, \\textbf{L}ocal \\textbf{A}djusting for \\textbf{S}upervised \\textbf{C}ontrastive learning (GPLASC). Specifically, to avoid task-level confusion, we divide the entire unit hypersphere of representations into non-overlapping regions, with the centers of the regions forming an inter-task pre-fixed \\textbf{E}quiangular \\textbf{T}ight \\textbf{F}rame (ETF). Meanwhile, for individual tasks, our method helps regulate the feature structure and form intra-task adjustable ETFs within their respective allocated regions. As a result, our method \\textit{simultaneously} ensures discriminative feature structures both between tasks and within tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into any existing contrastive continual learning framework. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness."}

In standard PnP methods, the denoiser is applied directly in the image domain, serving as an implicit prior on natural images. This paper considers an alternative analysis formulation of PnP, in which the prior is imposed on a transformed representation of the image, such as its gradient. Specifically, we train a Gaussian denoiser to operate in the gradient domain, rather than on the image itself. Conceptually, this is an extension of total variation (TV) regularization to learned TV regularization. To incorporate this gradient-domain prior in image reconstruction algorithms, we develop two analysis PnP algorithms based on half-quadratic splitting (APnP-HQS) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (APnP-ADMM). We evaluate our approach on image deblurring and super-resolution, demonstrating that the analysis formulation achieves performance comparable to image-domain PnP algorithms."}

These models include afferent connections (retina and LGN to the visual cortex) and long-range projections (connections across different visual cortical areas). However, in the mammalian visual system, there are connections within each visual cortical area, known as lateral (or horizontal) connections. These would roughly correspond to connections within CNN feature maps, and this important architectural feature is missing in current CNN models. In this paper, we present how such lateral connections can be modeled within the standard CNN framework, and test its benefits and analyze its emergent properties in relation to the biological visual system. We will focus on two main architectural features of lateral connections: (1) recurrent activation and (2) separation of excitatory and inhibitory connections. We show that recurrent CNN using weight sharing is equivalent to lateral connections, and propose a custom loss function to separate excitatory and inhibitory weights. The addition of these two leads to increased classification accuracy, and importantly, the activation properties and connection properties of the resulting model show properties similar to those observed in the biological visual system.

In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10.

This study introduces an adaptive focal loss function that dynamically emphasizes both hard and easy regions, taking into account their respective difficulty levels and annotation variability. The proposed methodology has two primary strategies: integrating a standard focal loss function as a baseline to design an adaptive focal loss function for proper prostate capsule segmentation. The focal loss baseline provides a robust foundation, incorporating class balancing and focusing on examples that are difficult to classify. The adaptive focal loss offers additional flexibility, addressing the fuzzy region of the prostate capsule and annotation variability by dilating the hard regions identified through discrepancies between expert and non-expert annotations. The proposed method dynamically adjusts the segmentation model's weights better to identify the fuzzy regions of the prostate capsule. The proposed adaptive focal loss function demonstrates superior performance, achieving a mean dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.940 and a mean Hausdorff distance (HD) of 1.949 mm in the testing dataset.

To address these challenges, we propose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework that improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage process of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to acquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios.

In this paper, we extend the investigation of Neural Collapse to the biased datasets with imbalanced attributes. We observe that models will easily fall into the pitfall of shortcut learning and form a biased, non-collapsed feature space at the early period of training, which is hard to reverse and limits the generalization capability. To tackle the root cause of biased classification, we follow the recent inspiration of prime training, and propose an avoid-shortcut learning framework without additional training complexity. With well-designed shortcut primes based on Neural Collapse structure, the models are encouraged to skip the pursuit of simple shortcuts and naturally capture the intrinsic correlations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method induces better convergence properties during training, and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on both synthetic and real-world biased datasets.

The calibration in fusion between sensors such as LiDAR and camera was always supposed to be precise in previous work. However, in reality, calibration matrices are fixed when the vehicles leave the factory, but mechanical vibration, road bumps, and data lags may cause calibration bias. As there is relatively limited research on the impact of calibration on fusion detection performance, multi-sensor detection methods with flexible calibration dependency have remained a key objective. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the sensitivity of the SOTA EPNet++ detection framework and prove that even slight bias on calibration can reduce the performance seriously. To address this vulnerability, we propose a re-calibration model to re-calibrate the misalignment in detection tasks. This model integrates LiDAR point cloud, camera image, and initial calibration matrix as inputs, generating re-calibrated bias through semantic segmentation guidance and a tailored loss function design. The re-calibration model can operate with existing detection algorithms, enhancing both robustness against calibration bias and overall object detection performance. Our approach establishes a foundational methodology for maintaining reliability in multi-modal perception systems under real-world calibration uncertainties."}

However, these oversee affine transformations which may represent better the changes in the images actually happening in natural conditions. Humans can be particularly invariant to these natural transformations, as opposed to the digital ones.In this work, we propose a methodology to evaluate any image quality metric by assessing their invariance to affine transformations, specifically: rotation, translation, scaling, and changes in spectral illumination. Here, invariance refers to the fact that certain distances should be neglected if their values are below a threshold. This is what we call invisibility threshold of a metric. Our methodology consists of two elements: (1) the determination of a visibility threshold in a subjective representation common to every metric, and (2) a transduction from the distance values of the metric and this common representation. This common representation is based on subjective ratings of readily available image quality databases. We determine the threshold in such common representation (the first element) using accurate psychophysics. Then, the transduction (the second element) can be trivially fitted for any metric: with the provided threshold extension of the method to any metric is straightforward. We test our methodology with some well-established metrics and find that none of them show human-like invisibility thresholds.This means that tuning the models exclusively to predict the visibility of generic distortions may disregard other properties of human vision as for instance invariances or invisibility thresholds. The data and code are publicly available to test other metrics."}

Concurrently, input images introduce inherent challenges such as photometric variability and sensor noise, complicating the reverse engineering process. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that conditionally factorizes the task into two sub-problems. First, we leverage vision-language foundation models (VLMs), a finetuned Llama3.2, to predict the global discrete base structure with semantic information. Second, we propose TrAssembler that, conditioned on the discrete structure with semantics, predicts the continuous attribute values. To support the training of our TrAssembler, we further constructed an annotated CAD dataset of common objects from ShapeNet.

In particular, we identify that one fundamental challenge as the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) nature of the generative model of interest. More concretely, on the input end, the model typically consumes both speech signals and character guidance (e.g., identity and emotion), which not only poses challenge on learning capacity but also hinders further adaptation to varying guidance; on the output end, holistic human motions mainly consist of facial expressions and body movements, which are inherently correlated but non-trivial to coordinate in current data-driven generation process. In response to the above challenge, we propose tailored designs to both ends. For the former, we propose to pre-train on data regarding a fixed identity with neutral emotion, and defer the incorporation of customizable conditions (identity and emotion) to fine-tuning stage, which is boosted by our novel X-Adapter for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. For the latter, we propose a simple yet effective transformer design, DU-Trans, which first divides into two branches to learn individual features of face expression and body movements, and then unites those to learn a joint bi-directional distribution and directly predicts combined coefficients. Evaluated on BEAT2 and SHOW datasets, Combo is highly effective in generating high-quality motions but also efficient in transferring identity and emotion.

To address this gap, we introduce the Industrial Screen Printing Anomaly Detection Dataset (ISP-AD). It presents challenging small and weakly contrasted surface defects embedded within structured patterns exhibiting high permitted design variability. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest publicly available industrial dataset to date, including both synthetic and real defects collected directly from the factory floor. Beyond benchmarking recent unsupervised anomaly detection methods, experiments on a mixed supervised training strategy, incorporating both synthesized and real defects, were conducted. Experiments show that even a small amount of injected, weakly labeled real defects improves generalization. Furthermore, starting from training on purely synthetic defects, emerging real defective samples can be efficiently integrated into subsequent scalable training. Overall, our findings indicate that model-free synthetic defects can provide a cold-start baseline, whereas a small number of injected real defects refine the decision boundary for previously unseen defect characteristics. The presented unsupervised and supervised dataset splits are designed to emphasize research on unsupervised, self-supervised, and supervised approaches, enhancing their applicability to industrial settings."}

As CLIP is increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is becoming even more critical to understand its limitations and embedded social biases to mitigate potentially harmful downstream consequences. However, the question of what internal mechanisms drive both the impressive capabilities as well as problematic shortcomings of CLIP has largely remained unanswered. To bridge this gap, we study the conceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we propose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that measures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with specific concepts. Our soft-pruning experiments reveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as pruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning random or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential concepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific reasoning, and video-language understanding. Moreover, we prove that high CCS heads learn spurious correlations which amplify social biases. These results position CCS as a powerful interpretability metric exposing the paradox of performance and social biases in CLIP models."}

Experiments show CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a cross-dataset generalization effect. We then rethink and question whether explicit thinking in RFT is always necessary. Challenging the convention that explicit thinking is crucial for the success of RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, exploring RFT without thinking by introducing a simple equality accuracy reward. We evaluate No-Thinking-RL on 6 diverse tasks across different model sizes and types. Experimental results reveal three key findings: 1). Visual perception tasks do not require thinking during RFT, as No-Thinking-RL consistently outperforms or matches Thinking-based RFT across model sizes. 2).} Models with limited capabilities struggle to generate high-quality CoT for RFT, making Thinking-based RFT less effective than No-Thinking-RL. 3). There are inconsistencies between the answers in the thinking and answer tags for some responses of thinking-based RFT, which show lower accuracy than the overall accuracy. We hypothesize that explicit thinking before verifiable answers may hinder reward convergence and reduce performance. To test this hypothesis, we propose Think-After-Answer, which places thinking after the answer to mitigate this effect for experimental verification. Lastly, we conduct a pilot study to explore whether MLLMs can learn when to think during RFT, introducing an Adaptive-Thinking method. Experiments show that it converges to a specific prompt depending on model capability and task complexity, achieving comparable or better performance than both Thinking and No-Thinking-RL. This suggests MLLMs can adaptively decide to think or not based on their capabilities and task complexity."}

However, the task becomes considerably more complex when a sign is partially obscured by surrounding objects, such as tree branches, billboards, or other elements of the urban environment. In our study, we investigated how partial occlusion of traffic signs affects their recognition. For this purpose, we collected a dataset comprising 5,746 images, including both fully visible and partially occluded signs, and made it publicly available. Using this dataset, we compared the performance of our custom convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieved 96% accuracy, with models trained using transfer learning. The best result was obtained by VGG16 with full layer unfreezing, reaching 99% accuracy. Additional experiments revealed that models trained solely on fully visible signs lose effectiveness when recognizing occluded signs. This highlights the critical importance of incorporating real-world data with partial occlusion into training sets to ensure robust model performance in complex practical scenarios and to enhance the safety of autonomous driving."}

To overcome them, computational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow multiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be unmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of superimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is critical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed images for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are trained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not cognizant to the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called indiSplit that is cognizant of the severity of the above mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is based on InDI, a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal starting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We introduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the degradation level (mixing asymmetry) of a given input image and (ii) a degradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference across all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in fluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and empirically demonstrate the applicability of indiSplit on $5$ public datasets.

Recent deep learning models, including Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods, have shown promising results in brain tumor image identification but still face limitations in handling uncertainty and generalizing across diverse medical conditions. Traditional KD methods often rely on a context-unaware temperature parameter to soften teacher model predictions, which does not adapt effectively to varying uncertainty levels present in medical images. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for optimal teacher-student model selection and a novel context-aware predictor approach for temperature scaling. The proposed context-aware framework adjusts the temperature based on factors such as image quality, disease complexity, and teacher model confidence, allowing for more robust knowledge transfer. Additionally, ACO efficiently selects the most appropriate teacher-student model pair from a set of pre-trained models, outperforming current optimization methods by exploring a broader solution space and better handling complex, non-linear relationships within the data. The proposed framework is evaluated using three publicly available benchmark datasets, each corresponding to a distinct medical imaging task. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving top accuracy rates: 98.01% on the MRI brain tumor (Kaggle) dataset, 92.81% on the Figshare MRI dataset, and 96.20% on the GastroNet dataset.

To fill these gaps, we introduce the Road and Bridge Semantic Change Detection (RB-SCD) dataset. As the first benchmark to systematically target semantic change detection of roads and bridges, RB-SCD offers comprehensive fine-grained annotations for 11 semantic change categories. This enables a detailed analysis of traffic infrastructure evolution. Building on this, we propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD). MFDCD integrates multimodal features in the frequency domain through two key components: (1) the Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC), which leverages wavelet transform to decompose visual features, enabling it to robustly model the continuity of linear transitions; and (2) the Textual Frequency Filter (TFF), which encodes semantic priors into frequency-domain graphs and applies filter banks to align them with visual features, resolving semantic ambiguities.

In Kyrgyzstan, more than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification performance.The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and generalization."}

However, the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution, the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in cross-resolution SAR target detection."}

While recent research has explored both graph-based and grid-based approaches, key limitations remain. Graph-based methods effectively capture non-Euclidean spatial structures but often incur high computational overhead, limiting their practicality in large-scale systems. In contrast, grid-based methods, which primarily leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer greater computational efficiency but struggle to model irregular spatial patterns due to the fixed shape of their filters. Moreover, both approaches often fail to account for inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, as they typically apply a shared set of parameters across diverse regions and time periods. To address these challenges, we propose the Deformable Dynamic Convolutional Network (DDCN), a novel CNN-based architecture that integrates both deformable and dynamic convolution operations. The deformable layer introduces learnable offsets to create flexible receptive fields that better align with spatial irregularities, while the dynamic layer generates region-specific filters, allowing the model to adapt to varying spatio-temporal traffic patterns.

We propose contextualized, task-relevant (CTR) attention networks, which generate attention maps from both human and RL agent gameplay in Atari environments. To evaluate whether the human CTR maps reveal internal attention, we validate our model by quantitative and qualitative comparison to the agent maps as well as to a temporally integrated overt attention (TIOA) model based on human eye-tracking data. Our results show that human CTR maps are more sparse than the agent ones and align better with the TIOA maps. Following a qualitative visual comparison we conclude that they likely capture patterns of internal attention. As a further application, we use these maps to guide RL agents, finding that human internal attention-guided agents achieve slightly improved and more stable learning compared to baselines. This work advances the understanding of human-agent attention differences and provides a new approach for extracting and validating internal attention from behavioral data."}

This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective designs for each task.

However, their static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands -- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by privacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches, including retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often computationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or continuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift: rethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in capability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies knowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than encoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics to dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by removing the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or access to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves predictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten ones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security guarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal prevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions. This ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against unauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for deployment in sensitive and regulated environments. Overall, by embedding removability into the architecture itself, this work establishes a new foundation for designing modular, scalable and ethically responsive AI models."}

In neural and physical systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs \\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase, gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution.

Compressed sensing finds applications in critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with $l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method. Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks."}

Existing methods for solving these (and related) problems often rely on restrictive independence assumptions between the leader's and followers' objectives, use samples inefficiently due to nested-loop algorithm structure, and lack finite-time convergence guarantees. To address these limitations, we propose AC-SMFG, a single-loop actor-critic algorithm that operates on continuously generated Markovian samples. The algorithm alternates between (semi-)gradient updates for the leader, a representative follower, and the mean field, and is simple to implement in practice. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the algorithm to a stationary point of the Stackelberg objective. To our knowledge, this is the first Stackelberg MFG algorithm with non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Our key assumption is a \"gradient alignment\" condition, which requires that the full policy gradient of the leader can be approximated by a partial component of it, relaxing the existing leader-follower independence assumption.

Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal components using existing sparse PCA algorithms.

While originally proposed for the language data, they quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities with various signal geometries. Despite this versatility, generalizing the attention mechanism to scenarios where data is presented at different scales from potentially different modalities is not straightforward. The attempts to incorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based on ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar problems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a mathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data. We then mathematically derive the neural attention mechanics for the proposed construct from the first principle of entropy minimization. We show that the derived formulation is optimal in the sense of being the closest to the standard Softmax attention while incorporating the inductive biases originating from the hierarchical/geometric information of the problem. We further propose an efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to compute our derived attention mechanism. By incorporating it within transformers, we show that the proposed hierarchical attention mechanism not only can be employed to train transformer models in hierarchical/multi-modal settings from scratch, but it can also be used to inject hierarchical information into classical, pre-trained transformer models post training, resulting in more efficient models in zero-shot manner."}

In this paper, we propose two innovations to address these limitations. First, we frame the mixed-precision quantization problem as a cooperative game among layers and introduce Shapley-based Progressive Quantization Estimation (SPQE) to efficiently obtain accurate Shapley estimates of layer sensitivities and inter-layer interactions. Second, building upon SPQE, we propose Interaction-aware Mixed-Precision Quantization (IMPQ) which translates these Shapley estimates into a binary quadratic optimization formulation, assigning either 2 or 4-bit precision to layers under strict memory constraints. Comprehensive experiments conducted on Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen-3 models across three independent PTQ backends (Quanto, HQQ, GPTQ) demonstrate IMPQ's scalability and consistently superior performance compared to methods relying solely on isolated metrics.

To address the challenge of reasoning over temporally shifting knowledge, we propose EvoReasoner, a temporal-aware multi-hop reasoning algorithm that performs global-local entity grounding, multi-route decomposition, and temporally grounded scoring. To ensure that the underlying KG remains accurate and up-to-date, we introduce EvoKG, a noise-tolerant KG evolution module that incrementally updates the KG from unstructured documents through confidence-based contradiction resolution and temporal trend tracking.

Mandayam", "title": "Mental Accounts for Actions: EWA-Inspired Attention in Decision Transformers", "abstract": "Transformers have emerged as a compelling architecture for sequential decision-making by modeling trajectories via self-attention. In reinforcement learning (RL), they enable return-conditioned control without relying on value function approximation. Decision Transformers (DTs) exploit this by casting RL as supervised sequence modeling, but they are restricted to offline data and lack exploration. Online Decision Transformers (ODTs) address this limitation through entropy-regularized training on on-policy rollouts, offering a stable alternative to traditional RL methods like Soft Actor-Critic, which depend on bootstrapped targets and reward shaping. Despite these advantages, ODTs use standard attention, which lacks explicit memory of action-specific outcomes. This leads to inefficiencies in learning long-term action effectiveness. Inspired by cognitive models such as Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA), we propose Experience-Weighted Attraction with Vector Quantization for Online Decision Transformers (EWA-VQ-ODT), a lightweight module that maintains per-action mental accounts summarizing recent successes and failures. Continuous actions are routed via direct grid lookup to a compact vector-quantized codebook, where each code stores a scalar attraction updated online through decay and reward-based reinforcement. These attractions modulate attention by biasing the columns associated with action tokens, requiring no change to the backbone or training objective. On standard continuous-control benchmarks, EWA-VQ-ODT improves sample efficiency and average return over ODT, particularly in early training.

The inability to access other agents' actions often leads to non-stationarity during value function updates and relative overgeneralization during value function estimation, hindering effective cooperative policy learning. However, existing works fail to address both issues simultaneously, due to their inability to model the joint policy of other agents in a fully decentralized setting. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method named Dynamics-Aware Context (DAC), which formalizes the task, as locally perceived by each agent, as an Contextual Markov Decision Process, and further addresses both non-stationarity and relative overgeneralization through dynamics-aware context modeling. Specifically, DAC attributes the non-stationary local task dynamics of each agent to switches between unobserved contexts, each corresponding to a distinct joint policy. Then, DAC models the step-wise dynamics distribution using latent variables and refers to them as contexts. For each agent, DAC introduces a context-based value function to address the non-stationarity issue during value function update. For value function estimation, an optimistic marginal value is derived to promote the selection of cooperative actions, thereby addressing the relative overgeneralization issue. Experimentally, we evaluate DAC on various cooperative tasks (including matrix game, predator and prey, and SMAC), and its superior performance against multiple baselines validates its effectiveness."}

However, existing red-teaming solutions (i) require white-box access to SIDs, which is infeasible for proprietary state-of-the-art detectors, and (ii) generate image-specific attacks through expensive online optimization. To address these limitations, we propose PolyJuice, the first black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming method for SIDs, based on an observed distribution shift in the T2I latent space between samples correctly and incorrectly classified by the SID. PolyJuice generates attacks by (i) identifying the direction of this shift through a lightweight offline process that only requires black-box access to the SID, and (ii) exploiting this direction by universally steering all generated images towards the SID's failure modes. PolyJuice-steered T2I models are significantly more effective at deceiving SIDs (up to 84%) compared to their unsteered counterparts.

The prevalent single-query approach is simple, but suffers from high estimation variance, motivating a multi-query paradigm to improves estimation accuracy. This, however, creates a critical trade-off: under a fixed budget of queries (i.e. cost), queries per iteration and the total number of optimization iterations are inversely proportional to one another. How to best allocate this budget is a fundamental, under-explored question.This work systematically resolves this query allocation problem. We analyze two aggregation methods: the de facto simple averaging (ZO-Avg), and a new Projection Alignment method (ZO-Align) we derive from local surrogate minimization. By deriving convergence rates for both methods that make the dependence on the number of queries explicit across strongly convex, convex, non-convex, and stochastic settings, we uncover a stark dichotomy: For ZO-Avg, we prove that using more than one query per iteration is always query-inefficient, rendering the single-query approach optimal. On the contrary, ZO-Align generally performs better with more queries per iteration, resulting in a full-subspace estimation as the optimal approach. Thus, our work clarifies that the multi-query problem boils down to a choice not about an intermediate query size, but between two classic algorithms, a choice dictated entirely by the aggregation method used.

Our work addresses two primary forms of this behavior: i) providing a final answer without preceding reasoning, and ii) employing non-standard reasoning formats to exploit the reward mechanism. To mitigate these, we introduce a composite reward function with specific penalties for these behaviors. Our experiments show that extending RLVR with our proposed reward model leads to better-formatted reasoning with less reward hacking and good accuracy compared to the baselines.

To address this, we propose a simple controlled experimental framework using the dSprites dataset with procedurally generated modifying factors. This allows us to investigate what influences successful class discovery. In particular, we study the relationship between the number of known/unknown classes and discovery performance, as well as the impact of known class 'coverage' on discovering new classes. Our empirical results indicate that the benefit of the number of known classes reaches a saturation point beyond which discovery performance plateaus. The pattern of diminishing return across different settings provides an insight for cost-benefit analysis for practitioners and a starting point for more rigorous future research of class discovery on complex real-world datasets."}

In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10.

The system has a compact, locally deployed model, which is supplemented by a larger, remote model, which is accessible via the network by incurring an offloading cost. For each sample, our system first uses the locally deployed model for inference. Based on the output of the local model, the sample may be offloaded to the remote model. This work aims to understand the fundamental trade-off between classification accuracy and these offloading costs within such a hierarchical inference (HI) system. To optimize this system, we propose an online learning framework that continuously adapts a pair of thresholds on the local model's confidence scores. These thresholds determine the prediction of the local model and whether a sample is classified locally or offloaded to the remote model. We present a closed-form solution for the setting where the local model is calibrated. For the more general case of uncalibrated models, we introduce H2T2, an online two-threshold hierarchical inference policy, and prove it achieves sublinear regret. H2T2 is model-agnostic, requires no training, and learns in the inference phase using limited feedback. Simulations on real-world datasets show that H2T2 consistently outperforms naive and single-threshold HI policies, sometimes even surpassing offline optima.

While nearest-neighbor-based methods like KATE have been widely adopted for this purpose, they suffer from well-known drawbacks in high-dimensional embedding spaces, including poor generalization and a lack of diversity. In this work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled, information theory-driven perspective. We first model an LLM as a linear function over input embeddings and frame the example selection task as a query-specific optimization problem: selecting a subset of exemplars from a larger example bank that minimizes the prediction error on a specific query. This formulation departs from traditional generalization-focused learning theoretic approaches by targeting accurate prediction for a specific query instance. We derive a principled surrogate objective that is approximately submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm with an approximation guarantee. We further enhance our method by (i) incorporating the kernel trick to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit mappings, and (ii) introducing an optimal design-based regularizer to encourage diversity in the selected examples.

We systematically evaluate classical physics-based models, empirical correction coefficients, and data-driven neural network architectures that incorporate age either as an input feature or as an explicit multiplicative bias.

Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs is well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the MetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited in diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance generation approach, termed as \\textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse training problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies. LSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features into a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space leads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity.

In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service."}

First, most existing dynamic GNN methods are built on temporally fixed static graphs, which fail to reflect the evolving nature of brain connectivity during seizure progression. Second, current efforts to jointly model temporal signals and graph structures and, more importantly, their interactions remain nascent, often resulting in inconsistent performance.

To this end, we propose a learning-to-unlearn Transformation-guided Federated Unlearning (ToFU) framework that incorporates transformations during the learning process to reduce memorization of specific instances. Our theoretical analysis reveals how transformation composition provably bounds instance-specific information, directly simplifying subsequent unlearning.

We evaluate both approaches empirically in a family of grid-world environments that are suitable for the current generation of large language models (LLMs). Our results suggest that improvements in LLMs already translate into better FWMs and FAs; that FAs based on current LLMs can already provide excellent policies for sufficiently simple environments; and that the coupling of FWMs and reinforcement learning agents is highly promising for more complex settings with partial observability and stochastic elements."}

However, its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box datasets.

The PAC-Bayes bound becomes an upper bound on the same true risk when the canonical observable loss is used and the dataset is drawn from the same mixture. Under these matched conditions, both limits are governed by a single capacity. Consequences include that, with value complexity and capacity fixed, adding labels alone cannot cross the bound; attaining lower risk on more complex targets requires capacity that grows with $\\log M$; and once useful signal saturates capacity, further optimization tends to fit channel regularities, consistent with reports of sycophancy and reward hacking.

This work introduces a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework for probabilistic prognostics estimation. By embedding Bayesian Neural Networks into the PINN architecture, the proposed approach produces principled, uncertainty-aware predictions. The method is applied to a transformer ageing case study, where insulation degradation is primarily driven by thermal stress. The heat diffusion PDE is used as the physical residual, and different prior distributions are investigated to examine their impact on predictive posterior distributions and their ability to encode a priori physical knowledge. The framework is validated against a finite element model developed and tested with real measurements from a solar power plant. Results, benchmarked against a dropout-PINN baseline, show that the proposed B-PINN delivers more reliable prognostic predictions by accurately quantifying predictive uncertainty.

In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage framework for in-hand pose estimation. The first stage involves sampling and pre-ranking pose candidates, followed by iterative refinement of these candidates in the second stage. In the final stage, post-ranking is applied to identify the most likely pose candidates. These stages are governed by a unified energy-based diffusion model, which is trained solely on simulated data. This energy model simultaneously generates gradients to refine pose estimates and produces an energy scalar that quantifies the quality of the pose estimates.

To learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets, which we call TSympNets, was introduced in [20]. We adapt the architecture of TSympNets and extend them to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. So far the approximation qualities of TSympNets were unknown. We close this gap by providing a universal approximation theorem for separable Hamiltonian systems and show that it is not possible to extend it to non-separable Hamiltonian systems.

In this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression (LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost. While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the $\\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for $\\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform consistently well for the discovery of isotropic and anisotropic materials, yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO."}

However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear, and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in both wind retrieval and short-term wind forecasting (up to 30 minutes lead time), with skill scores comparable to high-resolution NWP outputs in certain scenarios. The model exhibits robustness across different forecast horizons and pressure levels, and its predictions for wind speed and direction show superior agreement with observations compared to concurrent ERA5 reanalysis data. Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations (e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications."}

To tackle these problems, we introduce ReaSyn, a generative framework for synthesizable projection where the model explores the neighborhood of given molecules in the synthesizable space by generating pathways that result in synthesizable analogs. To fully utilize the chemical knowledge contained in the synthetic pathways, we propose a novel perspective that views synthetic pathways akin to reasoning paths in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, we introduce the chain-of-reaction (CoR) notation that explicitly states reactants, reaction types, and intermediate products for each step in a pathway. With the CoR notation, ReaSyn can get dense supervision in every reaction step to explicitly learn chemical reaction rules during supervised training and perform step-by-step reasoning. In addition, to further enhance the reasoning capability of ReaSyn, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based finetuning and goal-directed test-time compute scaling tailored for synthesizable projection. ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway diversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization performance in synthesizable goal-directed molecular optimization, and significantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in synthesizable hit expansion.

We resolve this by connecting generative outputs to an oracle classification task and showing that RS can still be enabled: the final response can be classified as a discrete action (e.g., service-robot commands in VLAs), as harmful vs. harmless (content moderation or toxicity detection in VLMs), or even applying oracles to cluster answers into semantically equivalent ones. Provided that the error rate for the oracle classifier comparison is bounded, we develop the theory that associates the number of samples with the corresponding robustness radius. We further derive improved scaling laws analytically relating the certified radius and accuracy to the number of samples, showing that the earlier result of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude fewer samples sufficing with minimal loss remains valid even under weaker assumptions.

In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3, showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts targeting specific capabilities like text rendering.

Adapting the batch size is challenging: using large batch sizes is more efficient due to parallel computation, but small-batch training often converges in fewer epochs and generalizes better. To address this challenge, we introduce a data-driven adaptation based on gradient diversity, enabling DiveBatch to maintain the generalization performance of small-batch training while improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Gradient diversity has a strong theoretical justification: it emerges from the convergence analysis of SGD. Evaluations of DiveBatch on synthetic and CiFar-10, CiFar-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that DiveBatch converges significantly faster than standard SGD and AdaBatch (1.06 -- 5.0x), with a slight trade-off in performance."}

We show how this perspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling to new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive science points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these issues.

Third, for LLMs there is the need to blacklist tokens that have strong marginal associations with the putative target response (class) of an attack, as such tokens give false detection signals.

We propose a LLM trigger inversion approach with three key components: i) discrete search, with putative triggers greedily accreted, starting from a select list of singletons; ii) implicit blacklisting, achieved by evaluating the average cosine similarity, in activation space, between a candidate trigger and a small clean set of samples from the putative target class; iii) detection when a candidate trigger elicits high misclassifications, and with unusually high decision confidence.

To model this task in a controlled environment, we utilize chess - a complex, sequential game with interdependent decisions which allows for quantitative analysis of performance and expertise (since the states, actions and game outcomes are well-defined). The availability of chess engines differing in style and expertise, allows scalable experimentation. We considered a team of (computer) chess players. At each turn, team members recommend a move and a manager chooses a recommendation. We compared the performance of two manager types.

Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity. Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However, its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial."}

In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition.

However, despite these promising advancements, there is no existing work studying how to provide valid uncertainty guarantees for these generated natural language explanations. Such uncertainty quantification is critical in understanding the confidence behind these explanations. Notably, generating valid uncertainty estimates for natural language explanations is particularly challenging due to the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs and the presence of noise in medical inquiries. To bridge this gap, in this work, we first propose a novel uncertainty estimation framework for these generated natural language explanations, which provides valid uncertainty guarantees in a post-hoc and model-agnostic manner. Additionally, we also design a novel robust uncertainty estimation method that maintains valid uncertainty guarantees even under noise.

While LLM agents are becoming more widely applied to intermediary tasks such as slang detection and slang interpretation, their generalizability and reliability are heavily dependent on whether these models have captured structural knowledge about slang that align well with human attested slang usages. To answer this question, we contribute a systematic comparison between human and machine-generated slang usages. Our evaluative framework focuses on three core aspects: 1) Characteristics of the usages that reflect systematic biases in how machines perceive slang, 2) Creativity reflected by both lexical coinages and word reuses employed by the slang usages, and 3) Informativeness of the slang usages when used as gold-standard examples for model distillation. By comparing human-attested slang usages from the Online Slang Dictionary (OSD) and slang generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3, we find significant biases in how LLMs perceive slang.

We first present a novel perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed. The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones.

We bridge this gap by proposing a family of flexible network-assisted models built upon a generalization of random forests (RF+), which achieves highly-competitive prediction accuracy and can be interpreted through feature importance measures.

To address this limitation, we introduce Concept Unlearning (CU) as a new requirement for LLM unlearning. We leverage knowledge graphs to represent the LLM's internal knowledge and define CU as removing the forgetting target nodes and associated edges. This graph-based formulation enables a more intuitive unlearning and facilitates the design of more effective methods.

Many existing unlearning methods aim to suppress undesirable outputs through additional training (e.g., gradient ascent), which reduces the probability of generating such outputs. While such suppression-based approaches can control model outputs, they may not eliminate the underlying knowledge embedded in the model's internal activations; muting a response is not the same as forgetting it. Moreover, such suppression-based methods often suffer from model collapse. To address these issues, we propose a novel unlearning method that directly intervenes in the model's internal activations. In our formulation, forgetting is defined as a state in which the activation of a forgotten target is indistinguishable from that of ``unknown'' entities. Our method introduces an unlearning objective that modifies the activation of the target entity away from those of known entities and toward those of unknown entities in a sparse autoencoder latent space. By aligning the target's internal activation with those of unknown entities, we shift the model's recognition of the target entity from ``known'' to ``unknown'', achieving genuine forgetting while avoiding over-suppression and model collapse. Empirically, we show that our method effectively aligns the internal activations of the forgotten target, a result that the suppression-based approaches do not reliably achieve.

As rotation layers, all combinations of one and two rotation sequences are considered. Four different entanglement topologies are compared: linear, circular, pairwise, and full. Different tasks are considered, namely the generation of probability distributions and images, and image classification. Achieved results are correlated with the expressibility and entanglement capability of the different circuits to understand how these features affect performance."}

This approach is motivated by the fact that commonly used gradient-based optimization methods can suffer from the barren plateaus problem. PSO is a stochastic optimization technique inspired by the collective behavior of a swarm of birds. The dimension of the swarm, the number of iterations of the algorithm, and the number of trainable parameters can be set. In this study, PSO has been used to train the entire structure of VQCs, allowing it to select which quantum gates to apply, the target qubits, and the rotation angle, in case a rotation is chosen. The algorithm is restricted to choosing from four types of gates: Rx, Ry, Rz, and CNOT. The proposed optimization approach has been tested on various datasets of the MedMNIST, which is a collection of biomedical image datasets designed for image classification tasks. Performance has been compared with the results achieved by classical stochastic gradient descent applied to a predefined VQC. The results show that the PSO can achieve comparable or even better classification accuracy across multiple datasets, despite the PSO using a lower number of quantum gates than the VQC used with gradient descent optimization."}

As we prove, while the convex hull of the token states still converges to a convex polytope, its structure can no longer be fully described by a maximal alignment set, prompting the introduction of quiescent sets to capture the invariant behavior of tokens near vertices. We show that these sets play a key role in understanding the asymptotic behavior of the system, even under time-varying alignment sensitivity parameters. We further show that localmax dynamics does not exhibit finite-time convergence and provide results for vanishing, nonzero, time-varying alignment-sensitivity parameters, recovering the limiting behavior of hardmax as a by-product.

Dynamic circuit operations, including mid-circuit measurement and reset, allow reuse of the same physical qubits across multiple agent-environment interactions, reducing qubit requirements from 7*T to 7 for T time steps while preserving logical continuity. Quantum arithmetic computes trajectory returns, and Grover's search is applied to the superposition of these evaluated trajectories to amplify the probability of measuring those with the highest return, thereby accelerating the identification of the optimal policy. Simulations demonstrate that the dynamic-circuit-based implementation preserves trajectory fidelity while reducing qubit usage by 66 percent relative to the static design. Experimental deployment on IBM Heron-class quantum hardware confirms that the framework operates within the constraints of current quantum processors and validates the feasibility of fully quantum multi-step reinforcement learning under noisy intermediate-scale quantum conditions.

This enables the synthesis of permutation circuits on any topology that can be embedded within the rectangular lattice, without the need to re-train the model. In this paper we show results for 5x5 lattice and compare them to previous AI topology-oriented models and classical methods, showing that they outperform classical heuristics, and match previous specialized AI models, and performs synthesis even for topologies that were not seen during training. We further show that the model can be fine tuned to strengthen the performance for selected topologies of interest.

A counterfactual lens on transport maps", "abstract": "Coupling probability measures lies at the core of many problems in statistics and machine learning, from domain adaptation to transfer learning and causal inference. Yet, even when restricted to deterministic transports, such couplings are not identifiable: two atomless marginals admit infinitely many transport maps. The common recourse to optimal transport, motivated by cost minimization and cyclical monotonicity, obscures the fact that several distinct notions of multivariate monotone matchings coexist. In this work, we first carry a comparative analysis of three constructions of transport maps: cyclically monotone, quantile-preserving and triangular monotone maps. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for their equivalence, thereby clarifying their respective structural properties. In parallel, we formulate counterfactual reasoning within the framework of structural causal models as a problem of selecting transport maps between fixed marginals, which makes explicit the role of untestable assumptions in counterfactual reasoning. Then, we are able to connect these two perspectives by identifying conditions on causal graphs and structural equations under which counterfactual maps coincide with classical statistical transports. In this way, we delineate the circumstances in which causal assumptions support the use of a specific structure of transport map. Taken together, our results aim to enrich the theoretical understanding of families of transport maps and to clarify their possible causal interpretations.

Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results."}

We leverage the cross-sectional and temporal hierarchical structure of turbines in wind farms and build cross-temporal hierarchies to further investigate how integrated cross-sectional and temporal dimensions can add value to forecast accuracy in wind farms. We found that cross-temporal reconciliation was superior to individual cross-sectional reconciliation at multiple temporal aggregations.

This phenomenon is commonly attributed to memorization of particular samples, memorization of the noise, and forced fitness into a data set of limited samples by using a high number of neurons. While it is true that the model encodes various peculiarities as the training process continues, we argue that most of the overfitting occurs in the process of reconciling sharply defined membership ratios. In this study, we present an approach that increases the classification accuracy of machine learning models by allowing the model to negotiate output representations of the samples with previously determined class labels. By setting up a negotiation between the models interpretation of the inputs and the provided labels, we not only increased average classification accuracy but also decreased the rate of overfitting without applying any other regularization tricks. By implementing our negotiation paradigm approach to several low regime machine learning problems by generating overfitting scenarios from publicly available data sets such as CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, and MNIST we have demonstrated that the proposed paradigm has more capacity than its intended purpose. We are sharing the experimental results and inviting the machine learning community to explore the limits of the proposed paradigm.

To address this, we introduce a new method for evaluating binary classification models on unlabeled tabular data that accurately estimates model performance under covariate shift and call it Probabilistic Adaptive Performance Estimation (PAPE). It can be applied to any performance metric defined with elements of the confusion matrix. Crucially, PAPE operates independently of the original model, relying only on its predictions and probability estimates, and does not need any assumptions about the nature of covariate shift, learning directly from data instead. We tested PAPE using over 900 dataset-model combinations from US census data, assessing its performance against several benchmarks through various metrics. Our findings show that PAPE outperforms other methodologies, making it a superior choice for estimating the performance of binary classification models."}

Firstly, under mild assumptions about the exponential family form of the LVM, we derive a necessary and sufficient constraint on the parameters of the LVM under which the prior and posterior over the latent variables are in the same exponential family. We then show that a variety of well-known and novel models indeed have this constrained, exponential family form.

However, federated Adam (FedAdam) algorithms suffer from a threefold increase in uplink communication overhead compared to federated SGD (FedSGD) algorithms, which arises from the necessity to transmit both local model updates and first and second moment estimates from distributed devices to the centralized server for aggregation. Driven by this issue, we propose a novel sparse FedAdam algorithm called FedAdam-SSM, wherein distributed devices sparsify the updates of local model parameters and moment estimates and subsequently upload the sparse representations to the centralized server. To further reduce the communication overhead, the updates of local model parameters and moment estimates incorporate a shared sparse mask (SSM) into the sparsification process, eliminating the need for three separate sparse masks. Theoretically, we develop an upper bound on the divergence between the local model trained by FedAdam-SSM and the desired model trained by centralized Adam, which is related to sparsification error and imbalanced data distribution. By minimizing the divergence bound between the model trained by FedAdam-SSM and centralized Adam, we optimize the SSM to mitigate the learning performance degradation caused by sparsification error. Additionally, we provide convergence bounds for FedAdam-SSM in both convex and non-convex objective function settings, and investigate the impact of local epoch, learning rate and sparsification ratio on the convergence rate of FedAdam-SSM. Experimental results show that FedAdam-SSM outperforms baselines in terms of convergence rate (over 1.1$\\times$ faster than the sparse FedAdam baselines) and test accuracy (over 14.5\\% ahead of the quantized FedAdam baselines)."}

Discovering informative representations of normal samples is crucial to detecting anomalies effectively. Recent self-supervised methods have successfully learned such representations by employing prior knowledge about anomalies to create synthetic outliers during training. However, we often do not know what to expect from unseen data in specialized real-world applications. In this work, we address this limitation with our new approach Con$_2$, which leverages prior knowledge about symmetries in normal samples to observe the data in different contexts. Con$_2$ consists of two parts: Context Contrasting clusters representations according to their context, while Content Alignment encourages the model to capture semantic information by aligning the positions of normal samples across clusters. The resulting representation space allows us to detect anomalies as outliers of the learned context clusters.

Such an estimate is biased and complicates the use of the Langevin method. Here, we propose a noise-corrected version of the Langevin algorithm, where the bias due to noisy data is removed, at least regarding first-order terms.

Despite recent advancements, existing spatial- and spectral-based DiGNNs have limitations due to their complex learning mechanisms and reliance on high-quality topology, resulting in low efficiency and unstable performance. To address these issues, we propose Directed Random Walk (DiRW), a plug-and-play strategy for most spatial-based DiGNNs and also an innovative model which offers a new digraph learning paradigm. Specifically, it utilizes a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topologies.

Scientific time series data are inherently complex, involving observations from multiple locations, each with various time-dependent data streams and exogenous factors that may be static or time-varying and either application-dependent or purely mathematical. This research analyzes hydrology time series from the CAMELS and Caravan global datasets, which encompass rainfall and runoff data across catchments, featuring up to six observed streams and 209 static parameters across approximately 8,000 locations.

The standard training procedure for CBMs is to predefine a candidate set of human-interpretable concepts, extract their values from the training data, and identify a sparse subset as inputs to a transparent prediction model. However, such approaches are often hampered by the tradeoff between exploring a sufficiently large set of concepts versus controlling the cost of obtaining concept extractions, resulting in a large interpretability-accuracy tradeoff. This work investigates a novel approach that sidesteps these challenges: BC-LLM iteratively searches over a potentially infinite set of concepts within a Bayesian framework, in which Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as both a concept extraction mechanism and prior. Even though LLMs can be miscalibrated and hallucinate, we prove that BC-LLM can provide rigorous statistical inference and uncertainty quantification.

This is because of the expensive forward and backward passes required for computation, substantial memory requirements to store large models, and poor generalization of influence estimates to new data. In this paper, we explore the use of small neural networks -- which we refer to as the InfluenceNetwork -- to estimate influence values, achieving up to 99% cost reduction. Our evaluation demonstrates that influence values can be estimated with models just 0.0027% the size of full language models (we use 7B and 8B versions). We apply our algorithm of estimating influence values (called NN-CIFT: Neural Networks for effiCient Instruction Fine-Tuning) to the downstream task of subset selection for general instruction fine-tuning. In our study, we include four state-of-the-art influence functions and show no compromise in performance, despite large speedups, between NN-CIFT and the original influence functions.

The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes, which manifest in PDEs through coupled, nonlinear terms that govern the evolution of multiple physical fields across scales. Neural operators have shown potential in short-term prediction of such complex spatio-temporal dynamics; however, achieving stable high-fidelity predictions and providing robust uncertainty quantification over extended time horizons remains an open and unsolved area of research. These limitations often lead to stability degradation with rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by multi-scale behaviors involving dynamics of different orders. To address these challenges, we propose an autoregressive Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn the system dynamics at a distinct scale through a dual-path architecture that integrates frequency-domain and spatio-temporal representations. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of \\ours blocks, the resulting model explicitly captures the underlying dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is introduced to learn a probabilistic refinement temporally while simultaneously quantifying prediction uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term probabilistic forecasting.

Traditional approaches utilize treatment regularization techniques such as the Integral Probability Metrics (IPM), re-weighting, and propensity score modeling to mitigate this bias. However, these regularizations may introduce undesirable information loss and limit the performance of the model. Furthermore, treatment effects vary across different external contexts, and the existing methods are insufficient in fully interacting with and utilizing these contextual features. To address these issues, we propose a Context-Aware uplift model based on the Two-Stage training approach (TSCAN), comprising CAN-U and CAN-D sub-models. In the first stage, we train an uplift model, called CAN-U, which includes the treatment regularizations of IPM and propensity score prediction, to generate a complete dataset with counterfactual uplift labels. In the second stage, we train a model named CAN-D, which utilizes an isotonic output layer to directly model uplift effects, thereby eliminating the reliance on the regularization components. CAN-D adaptively corrects the errors estimated by CAN-U through reinforcing the factual samples, while avoiding the negative impacts associated with the aforementioned regularizations. Additionally, we introduce a Context-Aware Attention Layer throughout the two-stage process to manage the interactions between treatment, merchant, and contextual features, thereby modeling the varying treatment effect in different contexts. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of TSCAN.

As a result, a naive context parroting model that copies directly from the context scores higher than leading time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of dynamical systems, including low-dimensional chaos, turbulence, coupled oscillators, and electrocardiograms -- and at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains recent works showing that large language models can often be repurposed for time series forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the underlying chaotic attractor, providing insight into previously observed in-context neural scaling laws. By revealing the performance gaps and failure modes of current time-series foundation models, context parroting can guide the design of future foundation models and help identify in-context learning strategies beyond parroting."}

Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these consistency judgments.

Höhne,Oliver Eberle", "title": "Capturing Polysemanticity with PRISM: A Multi-Concept Feature Description Framework", "abstract": "Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Within the context of large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP), current automated neuron-level feature description methods face two key challenges: limited robustness and the assumption that each neuron encodes a single concept (monosemanticity), despite increasing evidence of polysemanticity. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework specifically designed to capture the complexity of features in LLMs. Unlike approaches that assign a single description per neuron, common in many automated interpretability methods in NLP, PRISM produces more nuanced descriptions that account for both monosemantic and polysemantic behavior. We apply PRISM to LLMs and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score)."}

However, despite their widespread application to deep neural networks -- a representative case of stochastic nonconvex optimization -- the theoretical justification for their effectiveness in such settings remains limited. Quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM) is an algorithm that generalizes various momentum methods and has been studied to better understand the class of momentum-based algorithms as a whole. In this paper, we provide both asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence results for mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size. We show that achieving asymptotic convergence requires either a decaying learning rate or an increasing batch size. Since a decaying learning rate adversely affects non-asymptotic convergence, we demonstrate that using mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size -- without decaying the learning rate -- can be a more effective strategy. Our experiments show that even a finite increase in batch size can provide benefits for training neural networks."}

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from demonstrations.

Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy -- providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further demonstration.

Moreover, rejecting a token in the candidate sequence invalidates all subsequent tokens, leading to wasted computation during drafting. To overcome these limitations, we propose a cache-assisted parallel speculative decoding framework called CARD, which employs a novel query-and-correct paradigm. Our approach decouples drafting from verification: the draft model populates a shared cache with candidate tokens, while the target model concurrently refines the draft's trajectory. This enables inference at near-draft-speed, effectively leveraging the draft model's efficiency without additional fine-tuning. Experimental results show that CARD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 4.83x acceleration over vanilla autoregressive decoding, with no fine-tuning required for either models."}

Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs; Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin).

In this work, we propose a novel speaker embedding network that employs multiple sub-centers per speaker class during training, instead of a single center as in conventional approaches. This sub-center modeling allows the embedding to capture a broader range of speaker-specific variations while maintaining speaker classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed embeddings on a voice conversion task, showing improved naturalness and prosodic expressiveness in the synthesized speech."}

Compared to Transformers, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), and CNNs, FOVAL achieves superior performance, particularly in scenarios with limited and noisy gaze data. Evaluations across three benchmark datasets using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) and cross-dataset validation show a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.1 cm and strong generalisation without calibration. We further analyse inter-subject variability and domain shifts, providing insight into model robustness and adaptation.

In this work, we prove that the sample complexity scaling linearly in $d$ is required to achieve a small prediction error, while the corresponding computational complexity may scale exponentially in d. To address this challenge, we propose a kernel-based method leveraging classical shadows and truncated trigonometric expansions, enabling a controllable trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational overhead. Our results advance two crucial realms in quantum computation: the exploration of quantum algorithms with practical utilities and learning-based quantum system certification.

To ensure this alignment, a naive solution would be to retrain the agent using a reward function that encodes the user's specific preferences. However, such a reward function is typically not readily available, and as such, retraining the agent from scratch can be prohibitively expensive. We propose a more practical approach - to adapt the already trained policy to user-specific needs with the help of human feedback. To this end, we infer the user's intent through trajectory-level feedback and combine it with the trained task policy via a theoretically grounded dynamic policy fusion approach. As our approach collects human feedback on the very same trajectories used to learn the task policy, it does not require any additional interactions with the environment, making it a zero-shot approach. We empirically demonstrate in a number of environments that our proposed dynamic policy fusion approach consistently achieves the intended task while simultaneously adhering to user-specific needs."}

An ICL-based teacher generates pseudo-labels on unlabeled queries, while a student predicts them using only the query input, updating a lightweight adapter. This captures demonstration effects in a compact, reusable form, enabling efficient inference while remaining composable with new demonstrations. Although trained on noisy teacher outputs, the student often outperforms its teacher through pseudo-label correction and coverage expansion, consistent with the weak-to-strong generalization effect.

However, a critical challenge remains in that they sometimes generate factually incorrect answers. To address this, while many previous work has focused on identifying errors in their generation and further refining them, they are slow in deployment since they are designed to verify the response from LLMs only after their entire generation (from the first to last tokens) is done. Further, we observe that once LLMs generate incorrect tokens early on, there is a higher likelihood that subsequent tokens will also be factually incorrect. To this end, in this work, we propose Streaming-VR (Streaming Verification and Refinement), a novel approach designed to enhance the efficiency of verification and refinement of LLM outputs. Specifically, the proposed Streaming-VR enables on-the-fly verification and correction of tokens as they are being generated, similar to a streaming process, ensuring that each subset of tokens is checked and refined in real-time by another LLM as the LLM constructs its response. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the factual accuracy of LLMs, but also offers a more efficient solution compared to prior refinement methods."}

The current study describes a radiology software platform called NeoMedSys that can enable efficient deployment and refinements of AI models. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of running NeoMedSys for three months in real-world clinical settings and focused on improvement performance of an in-house developed AI model (VIOLA-AI) designed for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection.Methods: NeoMedSys integrates tools for deploying, testing, and optimizing AI models with a web-based medical image viewer, annotation system, and hospital-wide radiology information systems. A prospective pragmatic investigation was deployed using clinical cases of patients presenting to the largest Emergency Department in Norway (site-1) with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) or patients with suspected stroke (site-2). We assessed ICH classification performance as VIOLA-AI encountered new data and underwent pre-planned model retraining. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).Results: NeoMedSys facilitated iterative improvements in the AI model, significantly enhancing its diagnostic accuracy. Automated bleed detection and segmentation were reviewed in near real-time to facilitate re-training VIOLA-AI. The iterative refinement process yielded a marked improvement in classification sensitivity, rising to 90.3% (from 79.2%), and specificity that reached 89.3% (from 80.7%). The bleed detection ROC analysis for the entire sample demonstrated a high area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.949 (from 0.873). Model refinement stages were associated with notable gains, highlighting the value of real-time radiologist feedback."}

Existing work evaluating LLM causal reasoning primarily focuses on synthetically generated texts which involve straightforward causal relationships that are explicitly mentioned in the text. This fails to reflect the complexities of real-world tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs are capable of inferring causal relationships from real-world texts. We develop a benchmark drawn from real-world academic literature which includes diverse texts with respect to length, complexity of relationships (different levels of explicitness, number of nodes, and causal relationships), and domains and sub-domains. To the best of our knowledge, our benchmark is the first-ever real-world dataset for this task. Our experiments on this dataset show that LLMs face significant challenges in inferring causal relationships from real-world text, with the best-performing model achieving an average F1 score of only 0.477. Through systematic analysis across aspects of real-world text (degree of confounding, size of graph, length of text, domain), our benchmark offers targeted insights for further research into advancing LLM causal reasoning."}

Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline alternatives.

This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g. deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker identity."}

To overcome the lack of such a dataset, recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations.

While gray-box approaches leverage selective \"structural knowledge\" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them \"structural aspects\"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of \"opportunities\" for improved \"modular performance modeling\". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling \"hardness\", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an \"analytical matrix\" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role.

Our focus is on generalized momentum methods (GMMs)--a broad class that includes Nesterov's accelerated gradient, heavy-ball, and gradient descent methods--for minimizing smooth strongly convex objectives. We allow stochastic gradient errors that may be adversarial and biased, and quantify robustness of these methods to gradient errors via the risk-sensitive index (RSI) from robust control theory. For quadratic objectives with i.i.d. Gaussian noise, we give closed form expressions for RSI in terms of solutions to 2x2 matrix Riccati equations, revealing a Pareto frontier between RSI and convergence rate over the choice of step-size and momentum parameters. We then prove a large-deviation principle for time-averaged suboptimality in the large iteration limit and show that the rate function is, up to a scaling, the convex conjugate of the RSI function. We further show that the rate function and RSI are linked to the $H_\\infty$-norm--a measure of robustness to the worst-case deterministic gradient errors--so that stronger worst-case robustness (smaller $H_\\infty$-norm) leads to sharper decay of the tail probabilities for the average suboptimality. Beyond quadratics, under potentially biased sub-Gaussian gradient errors, we derive non-asymptotic bounds on a finite-time analogue of the RSI, yielding finite-time high-probability guarantees and non-asymptotic large-deviation bounds for the averaged iterates. In the case of smooth strongly convex functions, we also observe an analogous trade-off between RSI and convergence-rate bounds. To our knowledge, these are the first non-asymptotic guarantees for GMMs with biased gradients and the first risk-sensitive analysis of GMMs. Finally, we provide numerical experiments on a robust regression problem to illustrate our results."}

Dwyer", "title": "LoCaL: Countering Surface Bias in Code Evaluation Metrics", "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, reliable and effective code evaluation metrics (CEMs) have become crucial for progress across several software engineering tasks. While popular benchmarks often provide test cases to assess the correctness of generated code, crafting and executing test cases is expensive. Reference-based CEMs provide a cheaper alternative by scoring a candidate program based on its functional similarity to a reference. Although prior research has focused on reporting the weak correlation between these CEMs and functional correctness, the causes are only assumed, and plausible solutions remain unexplored. In this work, we critically evaluate four state-of-the-art reference-based CEMs, revealing their strong bias towards surface-level features rather than code functionality. Despite this surface bias, current evaluation datasets for these CEMs rarely include code pairs that are surface-similar yet functionally dissimilar, or functionally similar yet surface-dissimilar. To mitigate this gap, we propose LoCaL (Looks Can Lie), a CEM evaluation benchmark, with 3117 code pairs at both the method and program levels. Each pair is labeled with a functional similarity score and aims to target regions where CEMs are likely to perform poorly. The functional similarity scores are calculated through differential fuzzing, which eliminates the need for predefined test cases and, at the same time, improves the reliability of the scores by executing an order of magnitude more tests than prior work. We find that all four CEMs show significant performance degradation on LoCaL, compared to the baselines. Finally, based on our findings, we draw the implication that exposing CEMs to LoCaL-like data might facilitate the development of metrics that are robust to surface bias."}

Therefore, a growing body of work is proposed to generate commit messages automatically. These works all demonstrated that how to organize and represent code changes is vital in generating good commit messages, including the use of fine-grained graphs or embeddings to better represent code changes. In this study, we choose an alternative way to condense code changes before generation, i.e., proposing brief yet concise text templates consisting of the following three parts: (1) summarized code changes, (2) elicited comments, and (3) emphasized code identifiers. Specifically, we first condense code changes by using our proposed templates with the help of a heuristic-based tool named ChangeScribe, and then fine-tune CodeLlama-7B on the pairs of our proposed templates and corresponding commit messages. Our proposed templates better utilize pre-trained language models, while being naturally brief and readable to complement generated commit messages for developers.

To address these fundamental challenges, this paper conducts a comprehensive empirical study of existing vulnerability patch detection methods, revealing four key insights that guide the design of effective solutions: the critical impact of search space reduction, the superiority of pre-trained semantic understanding over architectural complexity, the temporal limitations of web crawling approaches, and the advantages of knowledge-driven methods. Based on these insights, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines version-driven candidate filtering with large language model-based multi-round dialogue voting to achieve accurate and efficient vulnerability patch identification.

This industrial paper presents our experience with using FMEA to analyze the safety of a CPS from the e-Bike domain. We used Simulink Fault Analyzer, an industrial tool that supports engineers with FMEA. We identified 13 realistic faults, modeled them, and analyzed their effects. We sought expert feedback to analyze the appropriateness of our models and the effectiveness of the faults in detecting safety breaches. Our results reveal that for the faults we identified, our models were accurate or contained minor imprecision that we subsequently corrected. They also confirm that FMEA helps engineers improve their models. Specifically, the output provided by the simulation-driven support for 38.4% (5 out of 13) of the faults did not match the engineers' expectations, helping them discover unexpected effects of the faults.

Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if necessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated validation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high engineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test suites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective translation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made by the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results.We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four repository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs from their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub projects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results."}

We extract related behaviors that usually perform a behavior intention as a behavior unit, which contains the representative semantic information of local behaviors and can be used to improve the robustness of behavior analysis. By learning the overall semantics of each behavior unit and the contextual relationships among behavior units based on a multilevel deep learning model, our approach can mitigate perturbation attacks that target local and large-scale behaviors.

However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40°C to 50°C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality.

This process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and implementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and verbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software structures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository generation from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning and implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly 3.9$\\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\\times$ other baselines.

The generic architecture provides the flexibility to configure processes during initialization as well as to adapt running instances at decision gates or during execution due to significant context change. The paper discusses context-awareness as the conceptual background. The technological capabilities of business rules and complex event processing (CEP) are outlined in an architecture design. A reference process is proposed and discussed in an exemplary application. The results provide an improvement over the current situation of static variable instantiation of business processes with local information. The proposed architecture extends the well-known combination of business rules and BPM systems with a context engine based on CEP. The resulting architecture for a BPM system using a context engine is generic in nature and, hence, requires to be contextualized for situated implementations. Implementation success is dependent on the availability of context information and process compensation options. Practitioners receive advice on a reference architecture and technology choices for implementing systems, which can provide and monitor context information for business processes as well as intervene and adapt the execution. Currently, there is no multi-purpose non-proprietary context engine based on CEP or any other technology available for BPM, which facilitates the adaptation of processes at run-time due to changes in context variables.

AdaDec automatically learns model-specific uncertainty thresholds and selectively invokes reranking when high uncertainty is detected, leveraging lookahead to refine token choice. Across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and DevEval benchmarks, AdaDec yields substantial improvements, achieving up to 20.9% absolute gains in Pass@1 accuracy compared with greedy decoding, while consistently outperforming prior adaptive decoding approaches such as AdapT.

Indeed, state-of-the-art compilers are limited in scope as they mostly deal with the data flow of applications, while having little or no support for control flow. Hence, they mostly target the mapping of single loops and/or delegate the management of control flow divergences to ad-hoc hardware units.Conversely, in this paper we show that control flow can be effectively managed and optimized at the compilation level, allowing for a broad set of applications to be targeted while being hardware-agnostic and achieving high performance. We embody our methodology in a modular compilation framework consisting of transformation and optimization passes, enabling support for applications with arbitrary control flows running on abstract CGRA meshes. We also introduce a novel mapping methodology that acts as a compilation back-end, addressing the limitations in available CGRA hardware resources and guaranteeing a feasible solution in the compilation process.

However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells, organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this conceptual framework."}

Zhang,Pinjia He,Ahmed E. Hassan", "title": "SWE-Effi: Re-Evaluating Software AI Agent System Effectiveness Under Resource Constraints", "abstract": "The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and code agents has demonstrated significant potential to assist software engineering (SWE) tasks, such as autonomous issue resolution and feature addition. Existing AI for software engineering leaderboards (e.g., SWE-bench) focus solely on solution accuracy, ignoring the crucial factor of effectiveness in a resource-constrained world. This is a universal problem that also exists beyond software engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must also be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of new metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness scores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome (e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time). In this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by re-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench benchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics. We found that AI system's effectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself, but on how well it integrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in a resource-efficient manner. We also identified systematic challenges such as the \"token snowball\" effect and, more significantly, a pattern of \"expensive failures\". In these cases, agents consume excessive resources while stuck on unsolvable tasks - an issue that not only limits practical deployment but also drives up the cost of failed rollouts during RL training. Lastly, we observed a clear trade-off between effectiveness under the token budget and effectiveness under the time budget, which plays a crucial role in managing project budgets and enabling scalable reinforcement learning, where fast responses are essential."}

While gray-box approaches leverage selective \"structural knowledge\" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them \"structural aspects\"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of \"opportunities\" for improved \"modular performance modeling\". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling \"hardness\", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an \"analytical matrix\" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives."}

Hassan", "title": "Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into autonomous systems, giving rise to a new class of software known as Agentware, where LLM-powered agents perform complex, open-ended tasks in domains such as software engineering, customer service, and data analysis. However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems."}
