It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems."}

We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance.

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement.

Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing.

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies."}

This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD.

For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details.

We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need."}

But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research."}

Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.The benchmark is publicly available atthis https URL"}

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model."}

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation."}

Seshia,Stuart Russell,Michael Dennis", "title": "Robust and Diverse Multi-Agent Learning via Rational Policy Gradient", "abstract": "Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents' policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments. Our project page can be found atthis https URL."}

We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs."}

Mainstream Transformer- and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based methods mainly rely on finite look-back windows, limiting their ability to model long-term dependencies and hurting forecasting performance. Naively extending the look-back window proves ineffective, as it not only introduces prohibitive computational complexity, but also drowns vital long-term dependencies in historical noise. To address these challenges, we propose CometNet, a novel Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting framework. CometNet first introduces a Contextual Motif Extraction module that identifies recurrent, dominant contextual motifs from complex historical sequences, providing extensive temporal dependencies far exceeding limited look-back windows; Subsequently, a Motif-guided Forecasting module is proposed, which integrates the extracted dominant motifs into forecasting. By dynamically mapping the look-back window to its relevant motifs, CometNet effectively harnesses their contextual information to strengthen long-term forecasting capability. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that CometNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, particularly on extended forecast horizons."}

Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice."}

In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition.

This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario.

Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF). However, current TSF models either use only single-period input, or lack customized designs for addressing multi-period characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training.

In this work, we propose the Interface Information-Aware Neural Operator (IANO), a novel framework that explicitly leverages interface information as a physical prior to enhance the prediction accuracy. The IANO architecture introduces two key components: 1) An interface-aware multiple function encoding mechanism jointly models multiple physical fields and interfaces, thus capturing the high-frequency physical features at the interface. 2) A geometry-aware positional encoding mechanism further establishes the relationship between interface information, physical variables, and spatial positions, enabling it to achieve pointwise super-resolution prediction even in the low-data regimes.

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability."}

Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control.

Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines.

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "abstract": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance.

Discovery Requires Chaos", "abstract": "The deep learning revolution has spurred a rise in advances of using AI in sciences. Within physical sciences the main focus has been on discovery of dynamical systems from observational data. Yet the reliability of learned surrogates and symbolic models is often undermined by the fundamental problem of non-uniqueness. The resulting models may fit the available data perfectly, but lack genuine predictive power. This raises the question: under what conditions can the systems governing equations be uniquely identified from a finite set of observations? We show, counter-intuitively, that chaos, typically associated with unpredictability, is crucial for ensuring a system is discoverable in the space of continuous or analytic functions. The prevalence of chaotic systems in benchmark datasets may have inadvertently obscured this fundamental limitation.More concretely, we show that systems chaotic on their entire domain are discoverable from a single trajectory within the space of continuous functions, and systems chaotic on a strange attractor are analytically discoverable under a geometric condition on the attractor. As a consequence, we demonstrate for the first time that the classical Lorenz system is analytically discoverable. Moreover, we establish that analytic discoverability is impossible in the presence of first integrals, common in real-world systems. These findings help explain the success of data-driven methods in inherently chaotic domains like weather forecasting, while revealing a significant challenge for engineering applications like digital twins, where stable, predictable behavior is desired. For these non-chaotic systems, we find that while trajectory data alone is insufficient, certain prior physical knowledge can help ensure discoverability. These findings warrant a critical re-evaluation of the fundamental assumptions underpinning purely data-driven discovery."}

We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content.

However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance.

This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second."}

MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods."}

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks.

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality.

This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions.

The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics.

To address these issues, we propose Diff-V2M, a general V2M framework based on a hierarchical conditional diffusion model, comprising two core components: visual feature extraction and conditional music generation. For rhythm modeling, we begin by evaluating several rhythmic representations, including low-resolution mel-spectrograms, tempograms, and onset detection functions (ODF), and devise a rhythmic predictor to infer them directly from videos. To ensure contextual and affective coherence, we also extract semantic and emotional features. All features are incorporated into the generator via a hierarchical cross-attention mechanism, where emotional features shape the affective tone via the first layer, while semantic and rhythmic features are fused in the second cross-attention layer. To enhance feature integration, we introduce timestep-aware fusion strategies, including feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) and weighted fusion, allowing the model to adaptively balance semantic and rhythmic cues throughout the diffusion process. Extensive experiments identify low-resolution ODF as a more effective signal for modeling musical rhythm and demonstrate that Diff-V2M outperforms existing models on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of objective metrics and subjective comparisons.

However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \\(l_1\\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix.

Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios.

We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures.

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses."}

Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques."}

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation."}

An Extensive Approach Considering Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models", "abstract": "With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction."}

Bernges,Florian Scholten", "title": "Algorithmic Advice as a Strategic Signal on Competitive Markets", "abstract": "As algorithms increasingly mediate competitive decision-making, their influence extends beyond individual outcomes to shaping strategic market dynamics. In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments."}

Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation.

Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations."}

To address this, we implement and evaluate a password strength scoring system by comparing four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Logistic Regression with a dataset of over 660,000 real-world passwords. Our primary contribution is a novel hybrid feature engineering approach that captures nuanced vulnerabilities missed by standard metrics.

Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.

Building on research in entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, we present a framework with three key stages: (1) Imagination shaping, where vague goals become clear value propositions, supported by AI agents that help with market scanning, idea refinement, and rapid concept generation; (2) Reality testing, where these ideas are tested through low-cost experiments, structured feedback loops, and efficient execution, with AI agents automating tasks such as prototyping, content creation, customer interaction, and data analysis; and (3) Reality scaling, where successful ideas are transformed into repeatable processes, scalable market strategies, and long-term business models, increasingly operated and optimized by autonomous or semi-autonomous AI workflows. We focus on the specific context of solopreneurship, characterized by limited human resources, complete accountability for decision-making, and a strong association between the founder's identity and the business.

Assessing and Mitigating Multimodal Knowledge Conflicts in Document Understanding", "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in document understanding, a rapidly growing research area with significant industrial demand. As a multimodal task, document understanding requires models to possess both perceptual and cognitive abilities. However, due to different types of annotation noise in training, current MLLMs often face conflicts between perception and cognition. Taking a document VQA task (cognition) as an example, an MLLM might generate answers that do not match the corresponding visual content identified by its OCR (perception). This conflict suggests that the MLLM might struggle to establish an intrinsic connection between the information it \"sees\" and what it \"understands\". Such conflicts challenge the intuitive notion that cognition is consistent with perception, hindering the performance and explainability of MLLMs. In this paper, we define the conflicts between cognition and perception as Cognition and Perception (C&P) knowledge conflicts, a form of multimodal knowledge conflict, and systematically assess them with a focus on document understanding. Our analysis reveals that even GPT-4o, a leading MLLM, achieves only 75.26% C&P consistency. To mitigate the C&P knowledge conflicts, we propose a novel method called Multimodal Knowledge Consistency Fine-tuning. Our method reduces C&P knowledge conflicts across all tested MLLMs and enhances their performance in both cognitive and perceptual tasks."}

Although originally inspired only by Minsky and Clark, subsequent analysis revealed that its structure echoes computational motifs from all four theories, suggesting that theoretical convergence can emerge naturally from implementation demands rather than deliberate synthesis. Controlled evaluations confirmed this: the structured agent achieved 95.8% task success versus 62.3% for baseline LLMs, demonstrating robust constraint adherence and reproducible reasoning. We describe this convergence under a broader descriptive meta-architecture called PEACE, highlighting recurring design patterns such as predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.

Rather than claiming theoretical unification, this paper proposes that intelligent architectures may evolve toward shared structural patterns shaped by practical constraints. As a position paper, it aims to frame this convergence as an interpretive reflection rather than a finalized theory, inviting further theoretical and experimental dialogue. Agentic Flow, or equivalently the Structured Cognitive Loop, thus offers a glimpse of how a unified cognitive form can arise not from abstraction, but from the necessities of real-world reasoning."}

RMs can reward any behaviour representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines (pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown automata. pdRMs can recognise and reward temporally extended behaviours representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal state values. We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs, and space complexity results for the proposed learning problems. Lastly, we propose an approach for off-policy RL algorithms that exploits counterfactual experiences with pdRMs. We conclude by providing experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs."}

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical, unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected ``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network. Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval. Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in response quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

Specifically, we focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We reframe GRPO into a staged training paradigm, leveraging a teacher's MCTS rollouts to construct a tree-structured curriculum of prefixes. This introduces the novel challenge of computing advantages for training samples that originate from different prefixes, each with a distinct expected return. To address this, we propose Staged Advantage Estimation (SAE), a framework for computing low-variance, prefix-aware advantages by projecting rewards onto a constraint set that respects the tree's hierarchy. Our empirical results on mathematical reasoning tasks show that SAE improves final accuracy over standard GRPO. This outcome is grounded in our theoretical analysis, which confirms that SAE reduces gradient variance-a principled path to improved sample efficiency.

We introduce a methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks: tool selection and argument generation. We propose \"decoupled fine-tuning\", a novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present AgentFlux, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of local models on end-user devices. AgentFlux decomposes the tool-call generation step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, AgentFlux implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases, and models that are 2x larger, in most cases."}

The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is proposed as an alternative architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model handles cognition, memory is stored externally, and execution is guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design allows intermediate results to be recorded and verified before actions are taken, improving traceability and evaluation. SCL is evaluated against prompt-based baselines such as ReAct and LangChain agents across three tasks: travel planning, conditional email drafting, and constraint-guided image generation. Under matched settings, SCL achieves an average task success rate of 86.3 percent, compared with 70.5 to 76.8 percent for baselines. It also shows higher goal fidelity, fewer redundant calls, and reduced unsupported assertions. These results indicate that separating cognition, memory, and control can enhance reliability and interpretability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL), single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components, including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems, advancing the development of autonomous GIS."}

However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions.

To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets.

Users may prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables a 2-3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance relative to the base model used for RL training."}

This raises a critical question: can RL post-training truly extend the inherent capability boundary of a base VLM, particularly for visual-centric spatial tasks where it initially fails? To investigate this, we introduce Ariadne, a framework utilizing synthetic mazes for multi-step spatial reasoning where task difficulty (e.g., path length, turns) is precisely controlled. We leverage this controllable environment to train VLMs using Reinforcement Learning with Verified Rewards (RLVR) in a difficulty-aware curriculum. Surprisingly, post-RLVR training, the VLM achieves over 50% accuracy on a problem set where the base model scored 0%, demonstrating that our approach expands the model's initial capability boundary. To assess real-world viability, we evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on practical benchmarks. Despite training only on synthetic maze samples, Ariadne achieves significant zero-shot improvements, averaging 16% on MapBench (e.g., museum navigation) and 24% on ReasonMap (subway transfer tasks). These results confirm that our method not only broadens the model's fundamental limits but also enhances its generalization to real-world spatial reasoning.

To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction.

Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations.

Common black-box metrics, such as variants of membership inference attacks and accuracy comparisons, primarily assess model outputs but often fail to capture residual information in intermediate layers. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Information Difference Index (IDI), a novel white-box metric inspired by information theory. IDI quantifies retained information in intermediate features by measuring mutual information between those features and the labels to be forgotten, offering a more comprehensive assessment of unlearning efficacy. Our experiments demonstrate that IDI effectively measures the degree of unlearning across various datasets and architectures, providing a reliable tool for evaluating strong unlearning in DNNs."}

This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research.

Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features.

We introduce the Visual Counter Turing Test (VCT2), a comprehensive benchmark of 166,000 images, comprising both real and synthetic prompt-image pairs produced by six state-of-the-art T2I systems: Stable Diffusion 2.1, SDXL, SD3 Medium, SD3.5 Large, DALL.E 3, and Midjourney 6.

This deficiency stems from the critical scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets necessary for cultivating sophisticated reasoning abilities. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel and scalable paradigm that harnesses frontier LLMs (GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates, which in turn synthesize a virtually infinite stream of high-quality problems and solutions. Using this paradigm, we create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a foundational dataset of over 7 million synthetically generated grade school math problems. Each problem is accompanied by a programmatically verifiable solution, offering an unprecedented level of quality at scale. This resource not only resolves the data scarcity issue for supervised fine-tuning but also provides a robust mechanism for model alignment through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Our approach elevates data augmentation by leveraging GPT-4 to generate meta-templates, ensuring diverse and complex problem structures. By providing a scalable solution to the data and verification bottleneck, TDG and TemplateGSM pave the way for a new generation of LLMs with powerful, reliable reasoning skills.

However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking sensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore RAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The main challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate answers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an algorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require the sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our extensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the non-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\\epsilon\\approx 10$ across different models and datasets."}

If these outcomes were all observed, one could simply make decisions using an \"oracle\" policy fit on the complete dataset. Inspired by this conceptualization, at each decision-time, our algorithm uses a generative model to probabilistically impute missing outcomes, fits a policy using the imputed complete dataset, and uses that policy to select the next action. We formally show that this algorithm is a generative formulation of TS and establish a state-of-the-art regret bound. Notably, our regret bound depends on the generative model only through the quality of its offline prediction loss, and applies to any method of fitting the \"oracle\" policy."}

Many existing metrics focus on a model's producibility, i.e. the quality and breadth of outputs it can generate. However, the actual value from using a generative model stems not just from what it can produce but whether a user with a specific goal can produce an output that satisfies that goal. We refer to this property as steerability. In this paper, we first introduce a mathematical decomposition for quantifying steerability independently from producibility. Steerability is more challenging to evaluate than producibility because it requires knowing a user's goals. We address this issue by creating a benchmark task that relies on one key idea: sample an output from a generative model and ask users to reproduce it. We implement this benchmark in user studies of text-to-image and large language models. Despite the ability of these models to produce high-quality outputs, they all perform poorly on steerability. These results suggest that we need to focus on improving the steerability of generative models. We show such improvements are indeed possible: simple image-based steering mechanisms achieve more than 2x improvement on this benchmark."}

In this paper, we argue that non-binary treatment decisions are integral to the decision process and controlled by decision-makers and, therefore, should be central to fairness analyses in algorithmic decision-making. We propose a causal framework that extends fairness analyses and explicitly distinguishes between decision-subjects' covariates and the treatment decisions. This specification allows decision-makers to use our framework to (i) measure treatment disparity and its downstream effects in historical data and, using counterfactual reasoning, (ii) mitigate the impact of past unfair treatment decisions when automating decision-making. We use our framework to empirically analyze four widely used loan approval datasets to reveal potential disparity in non-binary treatment decisions and their discriminatory impact on outcomes, highlighting the need to incorporate treatment decisions in fairness assessments.

Given text and images from home-service project descriptions provided by Thumbtack customers, we build embeddings-based softmax models that predict the professional category (e.g., handyman, bathroom remodeling) associated with each problem description. We then compare against prompts that ask state-of-the-art LLM models to solve the same problem. We find that the embeddings approach outperforms the best LLM prompts in terms of accuracy, calibration, latency, and financial cost. In particular, the embeddings approach has 49.5\\% higher accuracy than the prompting approach, and its superiority is consistent across text-only, image-only, and text-image problem descriptions. Furthermore, it yields well-calibrated probabilities, which we later use as confidence signals to provide contextualized user experience during deployment. On the contrary, prompting scores are overly uninformative. Finally, the embeddings approach is 14 and 81 times faster than prompting in processing images and text respectively, while under realistic deployment assumptions, it can be up to 10 times cheaper.

To address this, we introduce Repetitive Contrastive Learning (RCL), a token-level contrastive pretraining framework aimed at enhancing Mamba's selective capabilities. RCL pretrains a single Mamba block to strengthen its selective abilities and then transfers these pretrained parameters to initialize Mamba blocks in various backbone models, improving their temporal prediction performance. RCL uses sequence augmentation with Gaussian noise and applies inter-sequence and intra-sequence contrastive learning to help the Mamba module prioritize information-rich time steps while ignoring noisy ones. Extensive experiments show that RCL consistently boosts the performance of backbone models, surpassing existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, we propose two metrics to quantify Mamba's selective capabilities, providing theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative evidence for the improvements brought by RCL."}

Solutions to this problem lie in an infinitely vast space of parameterized skill sequences -- a space where common incremental methods struggle to find sequences that have non-obvious intermediate steps. Some approaches reason over lower-dimensional, symbolic spaces, which are more tractable to explore but may be brittle and are laborious to construct. In this work, we introduce MOSAIC, a skill-centric, multi-directional planning approach that targets these challenges by reasoning about which skills to employ and where they are most likely to succeed, by utilizing physics simulation to estimate skill execution outcomes. Specifically, MOSAIC employs two complementary skill families: Generators, which identify ``islands of competence'' where skills are demonstrably effective, and Connectors, which link these skill-trajectories by solving boundary value problems. By focusing planning efforts on regions of high competence, MOSAIC efficiently discovers physically-grounded solutions. We demonstrate its efficacy on complex long-horizon problems in both simulation and the real world, using a diverse set of skills including generative diffusion models, motion planning algorithms, and manipulation-specific models.

To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1.

We refer to this subset as AI-powered lethal autonomous weapon systems (AI-LAWS) and argue that they introduce novel risks -- including unanticipated escalation, poor reliability in unfamiliar environments, and erosion of human oversight -- all of which threaten both military effectiveness and the openness of AI research. These risks cannot be addressed by high-level policy alone; effective regulation must be grounded in the technical behavior of AI models. We argue that AI researchers must be involved throughout the regulatory lifecycle. Thus, we propose a clear, behavior-based definition of AI-LAWS -- systems that introduce unique risks through their use of modern AI -- as a foundation for technically grounded regulation, given that existing frameworks do not distinguish them from conventional LAWS. Using this definition, we propose several technically-informed policy directions and invite greater participation from the AI research community in military AI policy discussions."}

However, in many real-world scenarios, the parameters of the optimization problem are not known a priori and must be predicted from contextual features. This gives rise to predict-then-optimize problems, where a machine learning model predicts problem parameters that are then used to make decisions via optimization. A growing body of work on decision-focused learning (DFL) addresses this setting by training models specifically to produce predictions that maximize downstream decision quality, rather than accuracy. While effective, DFL is computationally expensive, because it requires solving the optimization problem with the predicted parameters at each loss evaluation. In this work, we address this computational bottleneck for linear optimization problems, a common class of problems in both DFL literature and real-world applications. We propose a solver-free training method that exploits the geometric structure of linear optimization to enable efficient training with minimal degradation in solution quality. Our method is based on the insight that a solution is optimal if and only if it achieves an objective value that is at least as good as that of its adjacent vertices on the feasible polytope. Building on this, our method compares the estimated quality of the ground-truth optimal solution with that of its precomputed adjacent vertices, and uses this as loss function.

As a result, we demonstrate that Bob might just be lucky: his task accuracy increases monotonically with the correlation between his task and Alice's. Even when Bob has provably uncorrelated tasks and input features from Alice's pre-trained network, he can achieve significantly better than random performance due to Alice's choice of network and optimizer.

Within the context of large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP), current automated neuron-level feature description methods face two key challenges: limited robustness and the assumption that each neuron encodes a single concept (monosemanticity), despite increasing evidence of polysemanticity. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework specifically designed to capture the complexity of features in LLMs. Unlike approaches that assign a single description per neuron, common in many automated interpretability methods in NLP, PRISM produces more nuanced descriptions that account for both monosemantic and polysemantic behavior. We apply PRISM to LLMs and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score)."}

This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks."}

Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data, which require pre-calibration and assume stable signals. However, this assumption often fails in dense cities, resulting in localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration method that accurately aligns LiDAR point clouds with satellite images, enabling frame-wise geo-registration and city-scale 3D reconstruction without prior localization. Our method uses a pre-trained Point Transformer to segment road points, then extracts road skeletons and intersections from the point cloud and the satellite image. Global alignment is achieved through rigid transformation using corresponding intersection points, followed by local non-rigid refinement with radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation discrepancies are corrected using terrain data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). To evaluate geo-registration accuracy, we measure the absolute distances between the roads extracted from the two modalities. Our method is validated on the KITTI benchmark and a newly collected dataset of Perth, Western Australia. On KITTI, our method achieves a mean planimetric alignment error of 0.69m, representing 50% improvement over the raw KITTI data. On Perth dataset, it achieves a mean planimetric error of 2.17m from GNSS values extracted from Google Maps, corresponding to 57.4% improvement over rigid alignment.

However, existing deep learning methods primarily rely on visual features, showing insufficient discriminative power in ambiguous boundary regions. Moreover, they lack explicit integration of medical domain knowledge such as anatomical semantics and geometric topology. Methods: We propose a knowledge-guided framework, Synchronized Tri-modal Prior Fusion (STPF), that explicitly integrates three heterogeneous knowledge priors: pathology-driven differential features (T1ce-T1, T2-FLAIR, T1/T2) encoding contrast patterns; unsupervised semantic descriptions transformed into voxel-level guidance via spatialization operators; and geometric constraints extracted through persistent homology analysis. A dual-level fusion architecture dynamically allocates prior weights at the voxel level based on confidence and at the sample level through hypernetwork-generated conditional vectors. Furthermore, nested output heads structurally ensure the hierarchical constraint ET subset TC subset WT. Results: STPF achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.868 on the BraTS 2020 dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 2.6 percentage points (3.09% relative improvement). Notably, five-fold cross-validation yields coefficients of variation between 0.23% and 0.33%, demonstrating stable performance. Additionally, ablation experiments show that removing topological and semantic priors leads to performance degradation of 2.8% and 3.5%, respectively.

SGNNs are pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. Simulation-grounded learning has been applied in multiple domains (e.g., surrogate models in physics, forecasting in epidemiology). We provide a unified framework for simulation-grounded learning and evaluated SGNNs across scientific disciplines and modeling tasks. We found that SGNNs were successful across domains: for prediction tasks, they nearly tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield prediction error by one-third, and maintained accuracy in ecological forecasting where task-specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution, a form of mechanistic interpretability. Back-to-simulation attribution matches real-world observations to the training simulations the model considers most similar, identifying which mechanistic processes the model believes best explain the observed data.

However, traditional RAG methods could fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition on reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline.

Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.

We explore prompting strategies using natural language and schematic diagrams, and, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce visual in-context examples within prompts in astronomy. Additionally, we evaluate lightweight supervised adaptation via LoRA fine-tuning. Our findings reveal three trends: (i) even prompt-based approaches can achieve good performance, suggesting that VLMs encode useful priors for unfamiliar scientific domains; (ii) however, outputs are highly unstable, i.e. varying sharply with superficial prompt changes such as layout, ordering, or decoding temperature, even when semantic content is held constant; and (iii) with just 15M trainable parameters and no astronomy-specific pretraining, fine-tuned Qwen-VL achieves near state-of-the-art performance (3% Error rate), rivaling domain-specific models.

At the same time, with minimal adaptation, generic VLMs can rival specialized models, offering a promising but fragile tool for scientific discovery."}

Using 360 simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we analyze over 25,000 recommendations.

We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans.

This paper examines the potential of MU as both a mechanism for operationalizing Responsible AI principles and a foundation for Adaptive AI in ML-driven educational systems. Drawing on a structured review of 42 peer-reviewed studies, the paper analyzes key MU mechanisms and technical variants, and how they contribute to the practical realization of Responsible and Adaptive AI. Four core intervention domains where MU demonstrates significant promise are identified: privacy protection, resilience to adversarial or corrupted data, fairness through bias mitigation, and adaptability to evolving contexts. Furthermore, MU interventions are mapped to the technical, ethical, and pedagogical challenges inherent in educational AI. This mapping illustrates the role of MU as a strategic mechanism for enhancing compliance, reinforcing ethical safeguards, and supporting adaptability by ensuring that models remain flexible, maintainable, and contextually relevant over time.

To mitigate the prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs upcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its feed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert diversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This paper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using experts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Coder and Qwen2). A key challenge lies in the fact that these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter space, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to harmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture. First, we establish this harmony in a training-free manner: we construct a shared backbone via a layer-aware fusion strategy and, crucially, alleviate parameter misalignment among experts using activation-based functional alignment. Subsequently, a stage of post-training coordinates the entire architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully integrates experts from heterogeneous sources, achieving an MoE model that significantly surpasses baselines in multi-domain tasks and out-of-distribution generalization."}

However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence.

Their ability to follow natural-language instructions, while powerful, also makes them vulnerable to a new class of attacks known as prompt injection. In these attacks, hidden or malicious instructions are inserted into user inputs or external content, causing the model to ignore its intended task or produce unsafe responses. This study proposes a unified framework for evaluating how resistant Large Language Models (LLMs) are to prompt injection attacks. The framework defines three complementary metrics such as the Resilience Degradation Index (RDI), Safety Compliance Coefficient (SCC), and Instructional Integrity Metric (IIM) to jointly measure robustness, safety, and semantic stability. We evaluated four instruction-tuned models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3 8B Instruct, and Flan-T5-Large) on five common language tasks: question answering, summarization, translation, reasoning, and code generation. Results show that GPT-4 performs best overall, while open-weight models remain more vulnerable. The findings highlight that strong alignment and safety tuning are more important for resilience than model size alone. Results show that all models remain partially vulnerable, especially to indirect and direct-override attacks. GPT-4 achieved the best overall resilience (RDR = 9.8 %, SCR = 96.4 %), while open-source models exhibited higher performance degradation and lower safety scores. The findings demonstrate that alignment strength and safety tuning play a greater role in resilience than model size alone. The proposed framework offers a structured, reproducible approach for assessing model robustness and provides practical insights for improving LLM safety and reliability."}

Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first \"think\" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior."}

This observation indicates a critical incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through concept inversion.

We task state-of-the-art LLMs with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains.

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline."}

However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence.

To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Sampling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling (SASS) strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples."}

Existing methods model speaker timbre and vocal content separately, losing essential acoustic information that degrades output quality while requiring significant computational resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose HQ-SVC, an efficient framework for high-quality zero-shot SVC. HQ-SVC first extracts jointly content and speaker features using a decoupled codec. It then enhances fidelity through pitch and volume modeling, preserving critical acoustic information typically lost in separate modeling approaches, and progressively refines outputs via differentiable signal processing and diffusion techniques. Evaluations confirm HQ-SVC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot SVC methods in conversion quality and efficiency. Beyond voice conversion, HQ-SVC achieves superior voice naturalness compared to specialized audio super-resolution methods while natively supporting voice super-resolution tasks."}

As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets.

To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications.

We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity.

However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario.

Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses."}

While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model."}

This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second."}

In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation.

However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation."}

To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development."}

While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents."}

We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures.

That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features.

To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained.

However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse.

However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:\\textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs."}

To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones.

However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment. We argue that as the three different angles from which simplification can be assessed tend to exhibit rather low correlations with one another, there is a need for a clear definition of the construct in ATS."}

Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice."}

CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%).

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "abstract": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making."}

Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search."}

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies."}

Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics.

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details.

NaturalTurn operates by distinguishing speakers' primary conversational turns from listeners' secondary utterances, such as backchannels, brief interjections, and other forms of parallel speech that characterize human conversation. Using data from a large conversation corpus, we show that NaturalTurn captures conversational turns more accurately than a baseline model. For example, it produces turns with durations and gaps that match empirical literature, reveals stronger linguistic alignment patterns between speakers, and uncovers otherwise hidden relationships between turn-taking and affective outcomes. NaturalTurn thus represents a pragmatic development in machine-generated transcript-processing methods, or \"turn models\", that will enable researchers to link turn-taking dynamics with important outcomes of social interaction, a central goal of conversation science."}

We propose three novel metrics: Success-DU and Recall to measure unlearning efficacy, and Accuracy to measure the remainder model utility. To benchmark this setting, we leverage both (1) an existing real-world knowledge dataset, MQuAKE, that provides one-step deduction instances, and (2) newly construct a novel semi-synthetic dataset, Eval-DU, that allows multiple steps of realistic deductions among synthetic facts.

Most theoretical accounts of the emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours that have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such feedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was intended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how communication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we present a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an unbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural differences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine communicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this outcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of psychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared intentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of communication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible socially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a general but well-developed capacity for social cognition."}

This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs."}

Using a systematic approach based on linguistic presupposition analysis, we investigate the conditions under which LLMs are more or less sensitive to adopt or reject false presuppositions. Focusing on political contexts, we examine how factors like linguistic construction, political party, and scenario probability impact the recognition of false presuppositions. We conduct experiments with a newly created dataset and examine three LLMs: OpenAI's GPT-4-o, Meta's LLama-3-8B, and MistralAI's Mistral-7B-v03.

To systematically investigate LLM reliability in mathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both solvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which incorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems synthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations. Experiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered. LLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate fabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a reliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable problems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of solvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite employing reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy to enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM reliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks."}

In this paper, we provide a mechanistic account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence. We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts (``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment and truthful AI systems."}

Given the LLM's diminished reasoning over extended context and its high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods could fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition on reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global context comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm towards retrieval-based stateful reasoning.

Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods.

Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first \"think\" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks.

We task state-of-the-art LLMs with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful'' and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial aggression.

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline."}

Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%.

While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals.

Here, in two studies of naturalistic speech corpora, we investigate backward predictability effects using improved measures and more powerful language models, introducing a new principled and conceptually motivated information-theoretic predictability measure that integrates predictability from both the future and the past context. Our first study revisits classic predictability effects on word duration. Our second study investigates substitution errors within a generative framework that independently models the effects of lexical, contextual, and communicative factors on word choice, while predicting the actual words that surface as speech errors. We find that our proposed conceptually-motivated alternative to backward predictability yields qualitatively similar effects across both studies. Through a fine-grained analysis of substitution errors, we further show that different kinds of errors are suggestive of how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context-based information during lexical planning. Together, these findings illuminate the functional roles of past and future context in how speakers encode and choose words, offering a bridge between contextual predictability effects and the mechanisms of sentence planning."}

To this end, we design three evaluation tasks which can be solved sequentially composing two modality-dependent skills, and evaluate several open MLLMs under two main settings: i) prompting the model to directly solve the task, and ii) using a two-step cascaded inference approach, which manually enforces the composition of the two skills for a given task. Even with these straightforward compositions, we find that all evaluated MLLMs exhibit a significant cross-modality skill composition gap. To mitigate the aforementioned gap, we explore two alternatives: i) use chain-of-thought prompting to explicitly instruct MLLMs for skill composition and ii) a specific fine-tuning recipe to promote skill composition. Although those strategies improve model performance, they still exhibit significant skill composition gaps, suggesting that more research is needed to improve cross-modal skill composition in MLLMs."}

On MS MARCO, TREC DL, and Robust04 no long-document model outperformed FirstP by more than 5% (on average). We hypothesized that this lack of improvement is not due to inherent model limitations, but due to benchmark positional bias (most relevant passages tend to occur early in documents), which is known to exist in MS MARCO. To confirm this, we analyzed positional relevance distributions across four long-document corpora (with six query sets) and observed the same early-position bias. Surprisingly, we also found bias in six BEIR collections, which are typically categorized as short-document datasets. We then introduced a new diagnostic dataset, MS MARCO FarRelevant, where relevant spans were deliberately placed beyond the first 512 tokens. On this dataset, many long-context models (including RankGPT) performed at random-baseline level, suggesting overfitting to positional bias. We also experimented with debiasing training data, but with limited success.

However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking sensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore RAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The main challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate answers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an algorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require the sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens.

We show that there are multiclass classification problems where predictive models holistically outperform LLM prompt-based frameworks. Given text and images from home-service project descriptions provided by Thumbtack customers, we build embeddings-based softmax models that predict the professional category (e.g., handyman, bathroom remodeling) associated with each problem description. We then compare against prompts that ask state-of-the-art LLM models to solve the same problem. We find that the embeddings approach outperforms the best LLM prompts in terms of accuracy, calibration, latency, and financial cost. In particular, the embeddings approach has 49.5\\% higher accuracy than the prompting approach, and its superiority is consistent across text-only, image-only, and text-image problem descriptions. Furthermore, it yields well-calibrated probabilities, which we later use as confidence signals to provide contextualized user experience during deployment. On the contrary, prompting scores are overly uninformative. Finally, the embeddings approach is 14 and 81 times faster than prompting in processing images and text respectively, while under realistic deployment assumptions, it can be up to 10 times cheaper. Based on these results, we deployed a variation of the embeddings approach, and through A/B testing we observed performance consistent with our offline analysis. Our study shows that for multiclass classification problems that can leverage proprietary datasets, an embeddings-based approach may yield unequivocally better results. Hence, scientists, practitioners, engineers, and business leaders can use our study to go beyond the hype and consider appropriate predictive models for their classification use cases."}

This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework specifically designed to capture the complexity of features in LLMs. Unlike approaches that assign a single description per neuron, common in many automated interpretability methods in NLP, PRISM produces more nuanced descriptions that account for both monosemantic and polysemantic behavior.

We introduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each token's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a small subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly, tokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus favoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass for alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural intervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning signals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We validate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks. By amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our algorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse strategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We further demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL objectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama.

TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of users."}

Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a feature of cooperative interaction where users are intentional about the degree to which they specify queries. We develop a principled framework based on a shared responsibility of query specification between user and system, distinguishing unambiguous and ambiguous cooperative queries, which systems can resolve through reasonable inference, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved. Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. This conceptualization around cooperation in resolving queries informs how to design and evaluate natural language interfaces for tabular data analysis, for which we distill concrete directions for future research and broader implications."}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become a standard interface for enabling such tool-based interactions. However, these interactions introduce substantial security concerns, particularly when the MCP server is compromised or untrustworthy. While prior benchmarks primarily focus on prompt injection attacks or analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM MCP interaction trajectories, limited attention has been given to the underlying system logs associated with malicious MCP servers. To address this gap, we present the first synthetic benchmark for evaluating LLMs ability to identify security risks from system logs. We define nine categories of MCP server risks and generate 1,800 synthetic system logs using ten state-of-the-art LLMs. These logs are embedded in the return values of 243 curated MCP servers, yielding a dataset of 2,421 chat histories for training and 471 queries for evaluation. Our pilot experiments reveal that smaller models often fail to detect risky system logs, leading to high false negatives. While models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) tend to over-flag benign logs, resulting in elevated false positives, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) offers a better precision-recall balance. In particular, after training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct achieves 83% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing large remote model by 9 percentage points. Fine-grained, per-category analysis further underscores the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing LLM safety within the MCP framework. Code and data are available at:this https URL"}

However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations.

To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness.

Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control.

Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features.

First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years."}

However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components.

However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model.

Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features.

In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization.

Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM).

Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks.

To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively.

We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Code is available atthis https URL."}

We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams.

Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios.

We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains."}

In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting."}

When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation."}

PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines."}

Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection."}

A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene."}

This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation."}

To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns.

Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent.

In this paper, we propose Semantic Cognition Over Potential-based Exploration (SCOPE), a zero-shot framework that explicitly leverages frontier information to drive potential-based exploration, enabling more informed and goal-relevant decisions. SCOPE estimates exploration potential with a Vision-Language Model and organizes it into a spatio-temporal potential graph, capturing boundary dynamics to support long-horizon planning. In addition, SCOPE incorporates a self-reconsideration mechanism that revisits and refines prior decisions, enhancing reliability and reducing overconfident errors. Experimental results on two diverse embodied navigation tasks show that SCOPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 4.6\\% in accuracy. Further analysis demonstrates that its core components lead to improved calibration, stronger generalization, and higher decision quality."}

Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science."}

Existing monolithic Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to resolve these multimodal ambiguous inputs, often failing silently or hallucinating responses. To address these ambiguities, we introduce the Plug-and-Play Clarifier, a zero-shot and modular framework that decomposes the problem into discrete, solvable sub-tasks. Specifically, our framework consists of three synergistic modules: (1) a text clarifier that uses dialogue-driven reasoning to interactively disambiguate linguistic intent, (2) a vision clarifier that delivers real-time guidance feedback, instructing users to adjust their positioning for improved capture quality, and (3) a cross-modal clarifier with grounding mechanism that robustly interprets 3D pointing gestures and identifies the specific objects users are pointing to. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework improves the intent clarification performance of small language models (4--8B) by approximately 30%, making them competitive with significantly larger counterparts. We also observe consistent gains when applying our framework to these larger models. Furthermore, our vision clarifier increases corrective guidance accuracy by over 20%, and our cross-modal clarifier improves semantic answer accuracy for referential grounding by 5%. Overall, our method provides a plug-and-play framework that effectively resolves multimodal ambiguity and significantly enhances user experience in egocentric interaction."}

A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatiotemporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into visionlanguage models to facilitate TSU task. Experiments on two realworld datasets demonstrate superior performance in the complex scene understanding scenarios with a few-shot learning strategy."}

Both computer vision and radar modules are included in the simulator. In computer vision module, the real-time model for object detection with global nearest neighbor is first used to detect and track human targets in the video. Then, the high-resolution network is used to estimate two-dimensional poses of the detected human targets.

In radar module, pose interpolation and smoothing are first achieved through the Savitzky-Golay method. Second, the delay model and the mirror method are used to simulate echoes in both free-space and through-the-wall scenarios.

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method."}

To address these issues, we introduce the BudjBim Wall (BBW) dataset, a large-scale annotated mesh dataset derived from high-resolution LiDAR scans of the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Budj Bim cultural landscape in Victoria, Australia. The BBW dataset captures historic dry-stone wall structures that are difficult to detect under vegetation occlusion, supporting research in underrepresented cultural heritage contexts. Building on this dataset, we propose LMSeg, a deep graph message-passing network for semantic segmentation of large-scale meshes. LMSeg employs a barycentric dual graph representation of mesh faces and introduces the Geometry Aggregation+ (GA+) module, a learnable softmax-based operator that adaptively combines neighborhood features and captures high-frequency geometric variations. A hierarchical-local dual pooling integrates hierarchical and local geometric aggregation to balance global context with fine-detail preservation. Experiments on three large-scale benchmarks (SUM, H3D, and BBW) show that LMSeg achieves 75.1% mIoU on SUM, 78.4% O.A. on H3D, and 62.4% mIoU on BBW, using only 2.4M lightweight parameters. In particular, LMSeg demonstrates accurate segmentation across both urban and natural scenes-capturing small-object classes such as vehicles and high vegetation in complex city environments, while also reliably detecting dry-stone walls in dense, occluded rural landscapes. Together, the BBW dataset and LMSeg provide a practical and extensible method for advancing 3D mesh segmentation in cultural heritage, environmental monitoring, and urban applications."}

To this end, we propose LangPose, a framework that leverages action knowledge by aligning motion embeddings with text embeddings of fine-grained action labels. LangPose operates in two stages: pretraining and fine-tuning. In the pretraining stage, the model simultaneously learns to recognize actions and reconstruct 3D poses from masked and noisy 2D poses. During the fine-tuning stage, the model is further refined using real-world 3D human pose estimation datasets without action labels. Additionally, our framework incorporates masked body parts and masked time windows in motion modeling, encouraging the model to leverage semantic information when spatial and temporal consistency is unreliable. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LangPose, achieving SOTA level performance in 3D pose estimation on public datasets, including Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.

Traditional scene representation methods generally cannot infer the geometry of unobserved regions of the objects in the image. Attempts have been made to leverage deep learning to train on a dataset of known objects and representations, and then generalize to new observations. However, this can be brittle to noisy real-world observations and objects not contained in the dataset, and do not provide well-calibrated reconstruction confidences. We propose BRRP, a reconstruction method that leverages preexisting mesh datasets to build an informative prior during robust probabilistic reconstruction. We introduce the concept of a retrieval-augmented prior, where we retrieve relevant components of our prior distribution from a database of objects during inference. The resulting prior enables estimation of the geometry of occluded portions of the in-scene objects. Our method produces a distribution over object shape that can be used for reconstruction and measuring uncertainty. We evaluate our method in both simulated scenes and in the real world.

These techniques typically employ heuristic mathematical modeling or supervised neural network fitting as the noise layer, to enhance watermarking robustness against SC. However, both strategies cannot fundamentally achieve an effective approximation of SC noise. Mathematical simulation suffers from biased approximations due to the incomplete decomposition of the noise and the absence of interdependence among the noise components.

Synthetic data provides high-quality labels while reducing the need for manual data collection and annotation. However, deep neural networks trained on synthetic data often face the Syn2Real problem, leading to poor performance in real-world deployments.To mitigate the aforementioned gap in image segmentation, we propose RAFT, a novel framework for adapting image segmentation models using minimal labeled real-world data through data and feature augmentations, as well as active learning. To validate RAFT, we perform experiments on the synthetic-to-real \"SYNTHIA->Cityscapes\" and \"GTAV->Cityscapes\" benchmarks. We managed to surpass the previous state of the art, HALO. SYNTHIA->Cityscapes experiences an improvement in mIoU* upon domain adaptation of 2.1%/79.9%, and GTAV->Cityscapes experiences a 0.4%/78.2% improvement in mIoU. Furthermore, we test our approach on the real-to-real benchmark of \"Cityscapes->ACDC\", and again surpass HALO, with a gain in mIoU upon adaptation of 1.3%/73.2%. Finally, we examine the effect of the allocated annotation budget and various components of RAFT upon the final transfer mIoU."}

However, popular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing incomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent advancements have explored optimization-based and learning-based layer-wise image vectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image vectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive simplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its autoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost non-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector graphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method leverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures occlusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and description for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as editing instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the identified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention control that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully preserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a large-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LayerPeeler significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing vectorization results with superior path semantics, geometric regularity, and visual fidelity."}

Because of its unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision methods typically overcome this by augmenting Mamba's global forward scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan to restore a full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load, eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward scan and executes it in per-thread registers. Building on LBMamba, we present LBVim, a backbone that alternates scan directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra backward sweeps. We validate our approach on both natural images and whole slide images (WSIs) and show that it constantly offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off. Under the same throughput, LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection dataset. Our method also boosts the accuracy of four SOTA Mamba models, namely VMamba, LocalVim, PlainMamba and Adventurer, by 0.5% to 3.4%. We integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance learning (MIL) model, MambaMIL, which is unidirectional. Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets show that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1, 1.67% better accuracy.

To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks."}

However, this assumption often fails in dense cities, resulting in localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration method that accurately aligns LiDAR point clouds with satellite images, enabling frame-wise geo-registration and city-scale 3D reconstruction without prior localization. Our method uses a pre-trained Point Transformer to segment road points, then extracts road skeletons and intersections from the point cloud and the satellite image.

Elevation discrepancies are corrected using terrain data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM).

In contrast, humans can effortlessly understand sparse, minimal representations like line drawings, suggesting that structure, rather than appearance, underlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose a novel structure-first learning paradigm that uses line drawings as an initial training modality to induce more compact and generalizable visual representations. We demonstrate that models trained with this approach develop a stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data efficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably, these models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring significantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance, which mirrors observations of low-dimensional, efficient representations in the human brain. Beyond performance improvements, structure-first learning produces more compressible representations, enabling better distillation into lightweight student models. Students distilled from teachers trained on line drawings consistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers, highlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Together, our results support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases, offering a simple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision systems."}

Deep learning-based segmentation offers a scalable approach for automated mapping of such features, but challenges remain: the visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation and the scarcity of labeled training data. This study presents DINO-CV, a self-supervised cross-view pre-training framework based on knowledge distillation, designed for accurate mapping of dry-stone walls using high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from airborne LiDAR. By learning invariant structural representations across multiple DEM-derived views, specifically Multi-directional Hillshade (MHS) and Visualization for Archaeological Topography (VAT), DINO-CV addresses both occlusion and data scarcity challenges.

Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via automatic differentiation.

Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that TiS-TSL exceeds other image-based state-of-the-arts by improving TEPE and EPE by at least 2.11% and 4.54%, respectively."}

Detecting refugee shelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due to their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using sub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework that achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters.

The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization.

In this study, a novel momentum encoder-based inter-slice fusion transformer (MOSformer) is proposed to overcome this issue by leveraging inter-slice information from multi-scale feature maps extracted by different encoders. Specifically, dual encoders are employed to enhance feature distinguishability among different slices. One of the encoders is moving-averaged to maintain consistent slice representations. Moreover, an inter-slice fusion transformer (IF-Trans) module is developed to fuse inter-slice multi-scale features.

REINFORCE, on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency.

This paper introduces vS-Graphs, a novel real-time VSLAM framework that integrates vision-based scene understanding with map reconstruction and comprehensible graph-based representation.

Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that vS-Graphs achieves an average of 15.22% accuracy gain across all tested datasets compared to state-of-the-art VSLAM methods.

Many existing metrics focus on a model's producibility, i.e. the quality and breadth of outputs it can generate. However, the actual value from using a generative model stems not just from what it can produce but whether a user with a specific goal can produce an output that satisfies that goal. We refer to this property as steerability. In this paper, we first introduce a mathematical decomposition for quantifying steerability independently from producibility. Steerability is more challenging to evaluate than producibility because it requires knowing a user's goals. We address this issue by creating a benchmark task that relies on one key idea: sample an output from a generative model and ask users to reproduce it. We implement this benchmark in user studies of text-to-image and large language models. Despite the ability of these models to produce high-quality outputs, they all perform poorly on steerability. These results suggest that we need to focus on improving the steerability of generative models. We show such improvements are indeed possible: simple image-based steering mechanisms achieve more than 2x improvement on this benchmark."}

In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground-truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the samethis http URLaddress these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data include label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels.

Concretely, we minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed as $\\lVert (W - \\widetilde{W}) \\Sigma^{1/2}\\rVert_F$ where $\\Sigma^{1/2}$ is the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$, $\\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights.

Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice. GitHub:this https URL"}

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "abstract": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations."}

Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency.

While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures.

To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models."}

However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines.

Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm.

This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes.

Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \\(l_1\\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices.

To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix.

For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns."}

To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task.

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses."}

At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature.

To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local).

In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods."}

Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques."}

To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD."}

As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE.

In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions.

However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression.

We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward.

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems."}

In this work, we introduce Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA), a novel framework that combine verbal and latent reasoning to produce stock time-series forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable. To reason over time-series, we convert stock price data into textual annotations and optimize the reasoning trace using an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward objective. To produce time-series outputs from textual reasoning, we condition the outputs of a time-series backbone model on the reasoning-based attributes.

However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later."}

Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF). However, current TSF models either use only single-period input, or lack customized designs for addressing multi-period characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training.

In this work, we propose the Interface Information-Aware Neural Operator (IANO), a novel framework that explicitly leverages interface information as a physical prior to enhance the prediction accuracy. The IANO architecture introduces two key components: 1) An interface-aware multiple function encoding mechanism jointly models multiple physical fields and interfaces, thus capturing the high-frequency physical features at the interface. 2) A geometry-aware positional encoding mechanism further establishes the relationship between interface information, physical variables, and spatial positions, enabling it to achieve pointwise super-resolution prediction even in the low-data regimes.

We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Given that such extensive resources are often inaccessible to many researchers and that life sciences data sets are frequently limited, we investigated whether small ANN models could achieve acceptable accuracy in protein-RNA prediction. We experimented with shallow feed-forward ANNs comprising two hidden layers and various non-linearities. These models did not utilize explicit structural information; instead, a sliding window approach was employed to implicitly consider the context of neighboring residues and bases. We explored different training techniques to address the issue of highly unbalanced data. Among the seven most popular non-linearities for feed-forward ANNs, only three: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Gated Linear Unit (GLU), and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) yielded converging models. Common re-balancing techniques, such as under- and over-sampling of training sets, proved ineffective, whereas increasing the volume of training data and using model ensembles significantly improved performance. The optimal context window size, balancing both false negative and false positive errors, was found to be approximately 30 residues and bases.

First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years."}

Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning or online learning.

We therefore build on the prior work of prospective learning, an extension of PAC learning (without control) in non-stationary environments (De Silva et al., 2023; Silva et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2026). Here, we further extend the PAC learning framework to address learning and control in non-stationary environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Control'', we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective control, foraging, which is a canonical task for any mobile agent, be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents.

An augmented WLS jointly estimates position and receiver clock bias, improving numerical stability under dynamic beam geometry.

Discovery Requires Chaos", "abstract": "The deep learning revolution has spurred a rise in advances of using AI in sciences. Within physical sciences the main focus has been on discovery of dynamical systems from observational data. Yet the reliability of learned surrogates and symbolic models is often undermined by the fundamental problem of non-uniqueness. The resulting models may fit the available data perfectly, but lack genuine predictive power. This raises the question: under what conditions can the systems governing equations be uniquely identified from a finite set of observations? We show, counter-intuitively, that chaos, typically associated with unpredictability, is crucial for ensuring a system is discoverable in the space of continuous or analytic functions. The prevalence of chaotic systems in benchmark datasets may have inadvertently obscured this fundamental limitation.More concretely, we show that systems chaotic on their entire domain are discoverable from a single trajectory within the space of continuous functions, and systems chaotic on a strange attractor are analytically discoverable under a geometric condition on the attractor. As a consequence, we demonstrate for the first time that the classical Lorenz system is analytically discoverable. Moreover, we establish that analytic discoverability is impossible in the presence of first integrals, common in real-world systems. These findings help explain the success of data-driven methods in inherently chaotic domains like weather forecasting, while revealing a significant challenge for engineering applications like digital twins, where stable, predictable behavior is desired. For these non-chaotic systems, we find that while trajectory data alone is insufficient, certain prior physical knowledge can help ensure discoverability. These findings warrant a critical re-evaluation of the fundamental assumptions underpinning purely data-driven discovery."}

However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively.

To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity.

Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research."}

Elective weekday procedures with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status 1-4 were included.

PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions.

We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures.

Unlike existing routing approaches, Routesplain first extracts human-interpretable concepts from each query (e.g., task, domain, reasoning complexity) and only routes based on these concepts, thereby providing intelligible, faithful rationales. We evaluate Routesplain on 16 state-of-the-art LLMs across eight software-related tasks; Routesplain outperforms individual models both in terms of accuracy and cost, and equals or surpasses all black-box baselines, with concept-level intervention highlighting avenues for further router improvements."}

To address the absence of domain-specific AD datasets, we fine-tune a Video Large Language Model on publicly available movie AD datasets so that it learns the narrative structure and conventions of AD. During inference, MCAD incorporates multimodal contextual cues such as player identities, soccer events and actions, and commentary from the game.

In scenarios where similar reactants could follow different electron redistribution patterns, these models typically predict the most common outcomes, neglecting less frequent but potentially crucial reaction patterns. These overlooked patterns, though rare, can lead to innovative methods for designing synthetic routes and significantly advance synthesis techniques. To address these limitations, we build a team of expert models to capture diverse plausible reaction outcomes for the same reactants, mimicking the divergent thinking of chemists. The proposed framework, ReactionTeam, is composed of specialized expert models, each trained to capture a distinct type of electron redistribution pattern in reaction, and a ranking expert that evaluates and orders the generated predictions.

To tackle this challenge, we study a specific model within this problem domain--contextual dueling bandits with adversarial feedback, where the true preference label can be flipped by an adversary. We propose an algorithm, namely robust contextual dueling bandits, which is based on uncertainty-weighted maximum likelihood estimation. Our algorithm achieves an $\\tilde O(d\\sqrt{T}/\\kappa+dC/\\kappa)$ regret bound, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $d$ is the dimension of the context, $\\kappa$ is the lower bound of the derivative of the link function, and $ 0 \\le C \\le T$ is the total number of adversarial feedback. We also prove a lower bound to show that our regret bound is nearly optimal, both in scenarios with and without ($C=0$) adversarial feedback. Our work is the first to achieve nearly minimax optimal regret for dueling bandits in the presence of adversarial preference feedback. Additionally, for the sigmoid link function, we develop a novel algorithm that takes into account the effect of local derivatives in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) analysis through a refined method for estimating the link function's derivative. This method helps us to eliminate the $\\kappa$ dependence in the leading term with respect to $T$, which reduces the exponential dependence on the parameter radius $B$ to a polynomial dependence. We conduct experiments to evaluate our proposed algorithm against various types of adversarial feedback.

This construction process is fundamental to applying graph-based models, yet it remains largely understudied and lacks formalization. Our research aims to address this gap by formalizing the graph construction problem and proposing an effective solution. We identify two critical challenges to achieve this goal: 1. The absence of dedicated datasets to formalize and evaluate the effectiveness of graph construction methods, and 2. Existing automatic construction methods can only be applied to some specific cases, while tedious human engineering is required to generate high-quality graphs. To tackle these challenges, we present a two-fold contribution. First, we introduce a set of datasets to formalize and evaluate graph construction methods. Second, we propose an LLM-based solution, AutoG, automatically generating high-quality graph schemas without human intervention. The experimental results demonstrate that the quality of constructed graphs is critical to downstream task performance, and AutoG can generate high-quality graphs that rival those produced by human experts.

Our work represents a further step in this direction by exploring supervised contrastive learning methods within the realm of graph representation learning. The main objective of this approach is to generate subject-level (i.e., graph-level) vector representations that bring together subjects sharing the same label while separating those with different labels. These connectome embeddings are derived from a graph neural network Encoder-Decoder architecture, which jointly considers structural and functional connectivity. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in a gender classification task using Human Connectome Project data.

Instead of viewing uncertainty in the environment as arising from unobservable latent parameters, our algorithm treats uncertainty as stemming from missing, but potentially observable outcomes (including both future and counterfactual outcomes). If these outcomes were all observed, one could simply make decisions using an \"oracle\" policy fit on the complete dataset. Inspired by this conceptualization, at each decision-time, our algorithm uses a generative model to probabilistically impute missing outcomes, fits a policy using the imputed complete dataset, and uses that policy to select the next action. We formally show that this algorithm is a generative formulation of TS and establish a state-of-the-art regret bound. Notably, our regret bound depends on the generative model only through the quality of its offline prediction loss, and applies to any method of fitting the \"oracle\" policy."}

REINFORCE, on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose leave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP combines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling multiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the robustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling.

Many existing metrics focus on a model's producibility, i.e. the quality and breadth of outputs it can generate. However, the actual value from using a generative model stems not just from what it can produce but whether a user with a specific goal can produce an output that satisfies that goal. We refer to this property as steerability. In this paper, we first introduce a mathematical decomposition for quantifying steerability independently from producibility. Steerability is more challenging to evaluate than producibility because it requires knowing a user's goals. We address this issue by creating a benchmark task that relies on one key idea: sample an output from a generative model and ask users to reproduce it. We implement this benchmark in user studies of text-to-image and large language models. Despite the ability of these models to produce high-quality outputs, they all perform poorly on steerability. These results suggest that we need to focus on improving the steerability of generative models. We show such improvements are indeed possible: simple image-based steering mechanisms achieve more than 2x improvement on this benchmark."}

However, these approaches overlook that such decisions are not inherently binary (e.g., approve or not approve bail or loan); they also involve non-binary treatment decisions (e.g., bail conditions or loan terms) that can influence the downstream outcomes (e.g., loan repayment or reoffending). In this paper, we argue that non-binary treatment decisions are integral to the decision process and controlled by decision-makers and, therefore, should be central to fairness analyses in algorithmic decision-making. We propose a causal framework that extends fairness analyses and explicitly distinguishes between decision-subjects' covariates and the treatment decisions. This specification allows decision-makers to use our framework to (i) measure treatment disparity and its downstream effects in historical data and, using counterfactual reasoning, (ii) mitigate the impact of past unfair treatment decisions when automating decision-making. We use our framework to empirically analyze four widely used loan approval datasets to reveal potential disparity in non-binary treatment decisions and their discriminatory impact on outcomes, highlighting the need to incorporate treatment decisions in fairness assessments. Moreover, by intervening in treatment decisions, we show that our framework effectively mitigates treatment discrimination from historical data to ensure fair risk score estimation and (non-binary) decision-making processes that benefit all stakeholders."}

Given text and images from home-service project descriptions provided by Thumbtack customers, we build embeddings-based softmax models that predict the professional category (e.g., handyman, bathroom remodeling) associated with each problem description. We then compare against prompts that ask state-of-the-art LLM models to solve the same problem. We find that the embeddings approach outperforms the best LLM prompts in terms of accuracy, calibration, latency, and financial cost. In particular, the embeddings approach has 49.5\\% higher accuracy than the prompting approach, and its superiority is consistent across text-only, image-only, and text-image problem descriptions. Furthermore, it yields well-calibrated probabilities, which we later use as confidence signals to provide contextualized user experience during deployment. On the contrary, prompting scores are overly uninformative. Finally, the embeddings approach is 14 and 81 times faster than prompting in processing images and text respectively, while under realistic deployment assumptions, it can be up to 10 times cheaper. Based on these results, we deployed a variation of the embeddings approach, and through A/B testing we observed performance consistent with our offline analysis. Our study shows that for multiclass classification problems that can leverage proprietary datasets, an embeddings-based approach may yield unequivocally better results. Hence, scientists, practitioners, engineers, and business leaders can use our study to go beyond the hype and consider appropriate predictive models for their classification use cases."}

However, standard BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to one-step self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step-sizes or multi-step self-consistency losses. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks.

A growing body of work on decision-focused learning (DFL) addresses this setting by training models specifically to produce predictions that maximize downstream decision quality, rather than accuracy. While effective, DFL is computationally expensive, because it requires solving the optimization problem with the predicted parameters at each loss evaluation. In this work, we address this computational bottleneck for linear optimization problems, a common class of problems in both DFL literature and real-world applications. We propose a solver-free training method that exploits the geometric structure of linear optimization to enable efficient training with minimal degradation in solution quality. Our method is based on the insight that a solution is optimal if and only if it achieves an objective value that is at least as good as that of its adjacent vertices on the feasible polytope. Building on this, our method compares the estimated quality of the ground-truth optimal solution with that of its precomputed adjacent vertices, and uses this as loss function.

As a result, we demonstrate that Bob might just be lucky: his task accuracy increases monotonically with the correlation between his task and Alice's. Even when Bob has provably uncorrelated tasks and input features from Alice's pre-trained network, he can achieve significantly better than random performance due to Alice's choice of network and optimizer. When there is little correlation between tasks, only reusing lower pre-trained layers is preferable, and we hypothesize the converse: that the optimal number of retrained layers is indicative of task and feature correlation.

Within the context of large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP), current automated neuron-level feature description methods face two key challenges: limited robustness and the assumption that each neuron encodes a single concept (monosemanticity), despite increasing evidence of polysemanticity. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework specifically designed to capture the complexity of features in LLMs. Unlike approaches that assign a single description per neuron, common in many automated interpretability methods in NLP, PRISM produces more nuanced descriptions that account for both monosemantic and polysemantic behavior. We apply PRISM to LLMs and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score)."}

Notably, most interpretability papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised language models, our alignment maps reach 100\\% interchange-intervention accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question: causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information. Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal abstraction should lead to exciting future work."}

SGNNs are pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. Simulation-grounded learning has been applied in multiple domains (e.g., surrogate models in physics, forecasting in epidemiology). We provide a unified framework for simulation-grounded learning and evaluated SGNNs across scientific disciplines and modeling tasks.

For inference tasks, SGNNs also accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution, a form of mechanistic interpretability.

To mitigate the prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs upcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its feed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert diversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This paper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using experts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Coder and Qwen2). A key challenge lies in the fact that these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter space, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to harmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture. First, we establish this harmony in a training-free manner: we construct a shared backbone via a layer-aware fusion strategy and, crucially, alleviate parameter misalignment among experts using activation-based functional alignment. Subsequently, a stage of post-training coordinates the entire architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully integrates experts from heterogeneous sources, achieving an MoE model that significantly surpasses baselines in multi-domain tasks and out-of-distribution generalization."}

We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments. DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve."}

We introduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each token's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a small subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly, tokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus favoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass for alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural intervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning signals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We validate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks. By amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our algorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse strategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We further demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL objectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama. These findings establish THR as a principled and fine-grained mechanism for dynamically controlling exploration and exploitation in RL-tuned LLMs, providing new tools for targeted fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive applications."}

In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$ quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds exhibit a sample complexity $ \\widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of the weight matrices.

Whereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing an isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use data-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed as $\\lVert (W - \\widetilde{W}) \\Sigma^{1/2}\\rVert_F$ where $\\Sigma^{1/2}$ is the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$, $\\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights.

Generalization was confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range = 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model using wearable devices."}

However, evaluations on broad downstream tasks reveal a consistent suboptimality of the routers in existing MoE LLMs, which results in a severe performance gap (e.g., 10-20% in accuracy) to the optimal routing. In this paper, we show that aligning the manifold of routing weights with that of task embedding can effectively reduce the gap and improve MoE LLMs' generalization performance. Our method, \"Routing Manifold Alignment (RoMA)\", introduces an additional manifold regularization term in the post-training objective and only requires lightweight finetuning of routers (with other parameters frozen). Specifically, the regularization encourages the routing weights of each sample to be close to those of its successful neighbors (whose routing weights lead to correct answers) in a task embedding space. Consequently, samples targeting similar tasks will share similar expert choices across layers. Building such bindings between tasks and experts over different samples is essential to achieve better generalization. Moreover, RoMA demonstrates the advantage of unifying the task understanding (by embedding models) with solution generation (by MoE LLMs). In experiments, we finetune routers in OLMoE, DeepSeekMoE, and Qwen3-MoE using RoMA. Evaluations on diverse benchmarks and extensive comparisons with baselines show the substantial improvement brought by RoMA."}

To evaluate invariance qualities, we first use a visualization-based testing framework which allows human analysts to assess and make informed decisions about the invariance properties of ML models. We show that such informative testing framework is preferred as ML models with the same global statistics (e.g., accuracy scores) can behave differently and have different visualized testing patterns. However, such human analysts might not lead to consistent decisions without a systematic sampling approach to select representative testing suites. In this work, we present a technical solution for selecting background scenes according to their semantic proximity to a target image that contains a foreground object being tested. We construct an ontology for storing knowledge about relationships among different objects using association analysis. This ontology enables an efficient and meaningful search for background scenes of different semantic distances to a target image, enabling the selection of a test suite that is both diverse and reasonable.

A key component of both optimization and sampling algorithms is the efficient implementation of the proximal map by the regularized cutting-plane method. We establish its iteration-complexity under both Hölder smoothness and hybrid settings using novel convergence analysis, yielding results that are new to the literature.

However, these advancements amplify the risks of adversarial attacks, especially when agents can access sensitive external functionalities. Nevertheless, manipulating LLM agents into performing targeted malicious actions or invoking specific tools remains challenging, as these agents extensively reason or plan before executing final actions. In this work, we present UDora, a unified red teaming framework designed for LLM agents that dynamically hijacks the agent's reasoning processes to compel malicious behavior. Specifically, UDora first generates the model's reasoning trace for the given task, then automatically identifies optimal points within this trace to insert targeted perturbations. The resulting perturbed reasoning is then used as a surrogate response for optimization. By iteratively applying this process, the LLM agent will then be induced to undertake designated malicious actions or to invoke specific malicious tools. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to existing methods across three LLM agent datasets. The code is available atthis https URL."}

Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design."}

The resulting morphological types were linked to mobility patterns through descriptive statistics, marginal effects estimation, and post hoc statistical testing. Here we show that distinct urban forms are systematically associated with different mobility behaviors, such as reticular morphologies being linked to significantly higher public transport use (marginal effect = 0.49) and reduced car dependence (-0.41), while organic forms are associated with increased car usage (0.44), and substantial declines in public transport (-0.47) and active mobility (-0.30). These effects are statistically robust (p < 1e-19), highlighting that the spatial configuration of urban areas plays a fundamental role in shaping transportation choices.

However, traditional RAG methods could fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition on reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution.

Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans.

Specifically, we focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We reframe GRPO into a staged training paradigm, leveraging a teacher's MCTS rollouts to construct a tree-structured curriculum of prefixes. This introduces the novel challenge of computing advantages for training samples that originate from different prefixes, each with a distinct expected return. To address this, we propose Staged Advantage Estimation (SAE), a framework for computing low-variance, prefix-aware advantages by projecting rewards onto a constraint set that respects the tree's hierarchy. Our empirical results on mathematical reasoning tasks show that SAE improves final accuracy over standard GRPO. This outcome is grounded in our theoretical analysis, which confirms that SAE reduces gradient variance-a principled path to improved sample efficiency.

The fused lasso provides an elegant convex formulation that produces a stepwise estimate of the mean, but quantifying the uncertainty of the detected changepoints remains difficult. Post-selection inference (PSI) offers a principled way to compute valid $p$-values after a data-driven selection, but its application to the fused lasso has been considered computationally cumbersome, requiring the tracking of many ``hit'' and ``leave'' events along the regularization path. In this paper, we show that the one-dimensional fused lasso has a surprisingly simple geometry: each changepoint enters in a strictly one-sided fashion, and there are no leave events. This structure implies that the so-called \\emph{conservative spacing test} of Tibshirani et al.\\ (2016), previously regarded as an approximation, is in fact \\emph{exact}. The truncation region in the selective law reduces to a single lower bound given by the next knot on the LARS path.

This finding establishes one of the rare cases in which an exact PSI procedure for the generalized lasso admits a closed-form pivot.

We introduce a methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks: tool selection and argument generation. We propose \"decoupled fine-tuning\", a novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present AgentFlux, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of local models on end-user devices. AgentFlux decomposes the tool-call generation step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, AgentFlux implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases, and models that are 2x larger, in most cases."}

However, it was not known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems -- qudits -- for all dimensions $d > 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of the authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to arbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum states being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered in previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to qudits of all $d\\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based on Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser state $|\\mathcal{S}\\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate $|\\mathcal{S}^\\ast\\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of independent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling technique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\\geq 2$:1.

In these prefill only scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of 1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation."}

Users may prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables a 2-3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance relative to the base model used for RL training."}

In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator for P3-LLM, featuring enhanced compute units to support hybrid numerical formats. Our careful choice of numerical formats allows to co-design low-precision PIM compute units that significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints.

Evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in terms of both KV-cache quantization and weight-activation quantization.

HDS uses three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to circumvent high-dimensional geometric calculations, producing an intelligent, non-uniform sample sequence that exploits statistically promising regions of the parameter space and improves final solution quality in high-dimensional optimization problems.A key feature of the method is optional Gaussian weights, which may be provided to influence the sample distribution towards known locations of interest.

Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs.

Developing a test plan includes tasks such as test configuration selection/generation, test configuration deployment planning, creating the test runs schedule, choosing strategies to mitigate the risk of interferences, etc. The manual design of a test plan is tedious and error prone. This task becomes harder especially when the systems are large and complex. In this paper we propose an approach for automating test plans generation. With this approach we aim at reducing service disruption that may be induced by the testing activities in production. We illustrate our approach with a case study and discuss its different aspects."}

Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval."}

Recently, researchers have proposed many deep learning approaches to detect software vulnerabilities. However, their accuracy is limited in practice. One of the main causes is low-quality training data (i.e., source code). To this end, we propose a new approach: SPLVD (Self-Paced Learning for Software Vulnerability Detection). SPLVD dynamically selects source code for model training based on the stage of training, which simulates the human learning process progressing from easy to hard. SPLVD has a data selector that is specifically designed for the vulnerability detection task, which enables it to prioritize the learning of easy source code. Before each training epoch, SPLVD uses the data selector to recalculate the difficulty of the source code, select new training source code, and update the data selector. When evaluating SPLVD, we first use three benchmark datasets with over 239K source code in which 25K are vulnerable for standard evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that SPLVD achieves the highest F1 of 89.2%, 68.7%, and 43.5%, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. Then we collect projects from OpenHarmony, a new ecosystem that has not been learned by general LLMs, to evaluate SPLVD further. SPLVD achieves the highest precision of 90.9%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness."}

Links to issues and external resources are often included in Pull Requests (PRs) to provide additional context, yet they are typically discarded in automated tasks such as PR summarization and code review comment generation. This limits the richness of information available to reviewers and increases cognitive load by forcing context-switching. To address this gap, we present AILINKPREVIEWER, a tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate previews of links in PRs using PR metadata, including titles, descriptions, comments, and link body content. We analyzed 50 engineered GitHub repositories and compared three approaches: Contextual LLM summaries, Non-Contextual LLM summaries, and Metadata-based previews. The results in metrics such as BLEU, BERTScore, and compression ratio show that contextual summaries consistently outperform other methods. However, in a user study with seven participants, most preferred non-contextual summaries, suggesting a trade-off between metric performance and perceived usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-powered link previews to enhance code review efficiency and to provide richer context for developers and automation in software engineering.The video demo is available atthis https URL, and the tool and its source code can be found atthis https URL."}

The method is evaluated using an exploratory study conducted with five professional software engineers, which compares traditional manual modeling to the proposed LLM-based approach.

This paper presents an empirical study of the configuration ecosystem of Claude Code, one of the most widely used agentic coding systems. We collected and analyzed 328 configuration files from public Claude Code projects to identify (i) the software engineering concerns and practices they specify and (ii) how these concerns co-occur within individual files.

We introduce Routesplain, the first LLM router for software-related tasks, including multilingual code generation and repair, input/output prediction, and computer science QA. Unlike existing routing approaches, Routesplain first extracts human-interpretable concepts from each query (e.g., task, domain, reasoning complexity) and only routes based on these concepts, thereby providing intelligible, faithful rationales. We evaluate Routesplain on 16 state-of-the-art LLMs across eight software-related tasks; Routesplain outperforms individual models both in terms of accuracy and cost, and equals or surpasses all black-box baselines, with concept-level intervention highlighting avenues for further router improvements."}

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead."}

Through signature verification, smart contracts can ensure that signers possess the required permissions, thus enhancing security and scalability. However, lacking checks on signature usage conditions can lead to repeated verifications, increasing the risk of permission abuse and threatening contract assets. We define this issue as the Signature Replay Vulnerability (SRV). In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to investigate the causes and characteristics of the SRVs. From 1,419 audit reports across 37 blockchain security companies, we identified 108 with detailed SRV descriptions and classified five types of SRVs. To detect these vulnerabilities automatically, we designed LASiR, which utilizes the general semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the static taint analysis of the signature state and identify the signature reuse behavior. It also employs path reachability verification via symbolic execution to ensure effective and reliable detection. To evaluate the performance of LASiR, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15,383 contracts involving signature verification, selected from the initial dataset of 918,964 contracts across four blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The results indicate that SRVs are widespread, with affected contracts holding $4.76 million in active assets. Among these, 19.63% of contracts that use signatures on Ethereum contain SRVs. Furthermore, manual verification demonstrates that LASiR achieves an F1-score of 87.90% for detection. Ablation studies and comparative experiments reveal that the semantic information provided by LLMs aids static taint analysis, significantly enhancing LASiR's detection performance."}

Their importance continues to grow as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of disasters, and as mobile devices become a primary information source for most people. However, despite their critical role, there has been limited systematic investigation into how these apps are designed and how users experience them in real- world contexts. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of disaster support mobile apps aimed at addressing this gap. We investigated 44 apps available on the Google Play Store and the App Store and analyzed 28,161 user reviews to understand common functionalities, user expectations, and challenges encountered during use. Our feature analysis identifies 13 core capabilities spanning the stages of preparation, response, and recovery of the disaster lifecycle. Topic Modelling revealed 18 topics, with the highest discussions focusing on app alert functionality, the use of maps, and monetary transactions. Sentiment analysis revealed that while 53.09% of users provided positive feedback, 24.30% expressed negative opinions, and 11.25% remained neutral. It also showed that signup/signin issues, network problems, and app crashes were the most frustrating to users. These impacted user safety by preventing access when it mattered most. Our findings emphasize the need to approach disaster apps as safety-critical and human-centred systems, where reliability and ease of use are essential. We provide practical recommendations to support developers and emergency agencies in improving the dependability and accessibility of future disaster support apps."}

Even novice developers can now design and generate complex framework-constrained software systems based on their high-level requirements with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when LLMs gradually \"take the wheel\" of software development, developers may only check whether the program works. They often miss security problems hidden in how the generated programs are implemented.In this work, we investigate the security properties of framework-constrained programs generated by state-of-the-art LLMs. We focus specifically on Chrome extensions due to their complex security model involving multiple privilege boundaries and isolated components. To achieve this, we built ChromeSecBench, a dataset with 140 prompts based on known vulnerable extensions. We used these prompts to instruct nine state-of-the-art LLMs to generate complete Chrome extensions, and then analyzed them for vulnerabilities across three dimensions: scenario types, model differences, and vulnerability categories. Our results show that LLMs produced vulnerable programs at alarmingly high rates (18%-50%), particularly in Authentication & Identity and Cookie Management scenarios (up to 83% and 78% respectively). Most vulnerabilities exposed sensitive browser data like cookies, history, or bookmarks to untrusted code. Interestingly, we found that advanced reasoning models performed worse, generating more vulnerabilities than simpler models. These findings highlight a critical gap between LLMs' coding skills and their ability to write secure framework-constrained programs."}

By pairing context-free grammars with constraints, users have the expressiveness of unrestricted grammars while retaining simple structure. However, producing inputs in the presence of such constraints can be challenging. In past approaches, SMT solvers have been found to be very slow at finding string solutions; evolutionary algorithms are faster and more general, but current implementations still struggle with complex constraints that would be required for domains such as compiler testing. In this paper, we present a novel approach for evolutionary language-based testing that improves performance by 3-4 orders of magnitude over the current state of the art, reducing hours of generation and constraint solving time to seconds. We accomplish this by (1) carefully transforming grammar definitions into Rust types and trait implementations, ensuring that the compiler may near-maximally optimize arbitrary operations on arbitrary grammars; and (2) using better evolutionary algorithms that improve the ability of language-based testing to solve complex constraint systems. These performance and algorithmic improvements allow our prototype, FANDANGO-RS, to solve constraints that previous strategies simply cannot handle. We demonstrate this by a case study for a C subset, in which FANDANGO-RS is able to generate 401 diverse, complex, and valid test inputs for a C compiler per minute."}

QLCode embeds an LLM in a synthesis loop with execution feedback, while constraining its reasoning using a custom MCP interface that allows structured interaction with a Language Server Protocol (for syntax guidance) and a RAG database (for semantic retrieval of queries and documentation). This approach allows QLCoder to generate syntactically and semantically valid security queries. We evaluate QLCode on 176 existing CVEs across 111 Java projects. Building upon the Claude Code agent framework, QLCoder synthesizes correct queries that detect the CVE in the vulnerable but not in the patched versions for 53.4% of CVEs. In comparison, using only Claude Code synthesizes 10% correct queries."}
