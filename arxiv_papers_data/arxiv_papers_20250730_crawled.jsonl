Conventional explainable AI approaches offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang, together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of AI decision-making."}

Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile, evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided synthetic data creation."}

In parallel, we propose meta-alignment as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured feedback ingestion, including \"likes\", overrides, and abstentions.

Our results show that while some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust. Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a new path for safety alignment.

The first method is based on converting a Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites, the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles."}

In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI) approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG, ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation. At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive environments."}

However, it lacks explicit component selection rules, necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover, existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially achieving ACC of 65.47\\% compared to the 56.12\\% achieved by GPT-4 on the Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline."}

However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval, optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively. Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent, greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methods."}

An open question is how systematic this interpretation process is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they \"understand\" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of lowest complexity.

LeMix integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload characteristics and system conditions.

Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements -- that would otherwise remain unspoken.

More importantly, human evaluation reveals that clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners."}

We propose a more nuanced framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures."}

Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.

Large Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits (e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.

In this work, we introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior modeling in chess.

This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification.

The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems.

To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting functional organization."}

In this paper, we propose $\\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time.

Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.

Consequently, 12 out of 22 valid teams outperformed the whisper-large-v2 baseline in terms of WER, while 17 teams surpassed the baseline on SemScore. Notably, the top team achieved the lowest WER of 8.11\\%, and the highest SemScore of 88.44\\% at the same time, setting new benchmarks for future ASR systems in recognizing impaired speech."}

While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning."}

Moreover, concept drift affects not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges, structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \\textit{Jaccard} similarity and a global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \\textit{Bernoulli} process to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23 real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\\%, and 12 local baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\\%, establishing its robustness for online multi-label classification."}

We propose a agent-based framework using large language models (LLMs) to simulate society communication behaviors, where several agents can discuss news. These agents can be designed to be experts from various occupation, or from different age group. Our results indicate that this framework can identify confusions or even misunderstanding of news for the agent through the iterative discussion process.

Addressing two key gaps: the dominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in qualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support disciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action research methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as research question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and design thinking.

This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's 7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally, we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems."}

Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph, outperforming traditional RAG methods.

Through formal analysis, empirical evidence, and detailed critique of both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on semantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to define operational metrics. Particular focus is placed on the conflation of topological network analogies with protocol-level architecture, the mischaracterisation of Bitcoin's design--including the role of miners, SPV clients, and header-based verification--and the failure to ground claims in complexity-theoretic or adversarial models. By reconstructing Bitcoin as a deterministic, stateless distribution protocol governed by evidentiary trust, we show that scalability is not a trade-off but an engineering outcome. The paper concludes by identifying systemic issues in academic discourse and peer review that have allowed such fallacies to persist, and offers formal criteria for evaluating future claims in blockchain research."}

While effective in many domains, such systems face persistent challenges including sparse and noisy interaction data, cold-start problems, limited personalization depth, and inadequate semantic understanding of user and item content. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new paradigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native mechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged to tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of LLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation, illustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment, and interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision. LLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate effectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external knowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven architectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of conventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for understanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance.

This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel security risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can cascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent trust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability Scoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous to Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In an ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to cascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust its outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key variables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.), capturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure. We then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors, and inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic AI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we argue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking frameworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols. We outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using architectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust failures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized agent-to-agent security evaluation.

Within this framework, we introduce Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of LDFR beyond synthetic settings.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs. We will release our code to the community."}

Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail (minority) classes.

They also fail to model flow boiling velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular), and boundary conditions.

To do this, we learn a HMLN distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to generate the observed caption.

We evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets.

However, inevitably the packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is allowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally balance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic maximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of service (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for different network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve it. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward function, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but discontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always tries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network and traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when cell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving depending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than ~1% QoS degradation."}

However, most of these solvers focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP), which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry, resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments.

Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries, MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution, MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous vehicles in complex environments."}

Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars, where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets, yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability. Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image, leading to more compact pairs of distillation.

This is markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying levels of confidence across tasks.

Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less robust."}

Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts, exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However, text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs: multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting (DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts. Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection."}

This study examines how students' AI literacy and prior exposure to AI technologies shape their perceptions of Socratic Mind, an interactive AI-powered formative assessment tool. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory and user experience research, we analyze relationships among AI literacy, perceived usability, satisfaction, engagement, and perceived learning effectiveness. Data from 309 undergraduates in Computer Science and Business courses were collected through validated surveys. Partial least squares structural equation modeling showed that AI literacy - especially self-efficacy, conceptual understanding, and application skills - significantly predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement. Usability and satisfaction, in turn, strongly predict perceived learning effectiveness, while prior AI exposure showed no significant effect. These findings highlight that AI literacy, rather than exposure alone, shapes student experiences.

While training-based approaches address this limitation by training on high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently, training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches, which we call ``patch-level distribution shift\" and ``increased patch monotonicity.\" To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT), a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to high-resolution image generation."}

Despite rapid advancements, a substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes (DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA) layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset.

Our findings reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model simplification without sacrificing performance.

A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available (i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2) leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling strategy.

This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands.

This work examines the potential of LLMs as assistive agents in the specification and, where technically feasible, estimation of Multinomial Logit models. We implement a systematic experimental framework involving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations. These configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting vs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs. Chain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data dictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated, and evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and model complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and behaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by structured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to produce meaningful specifications. Claude 4 Sonnet consistently produced the best-fitting and most complex models, while GPT models suggested models with robust and stable modelling outcomes. Some LLMs performed better when provided with just data dictionary, suggesting that limiting raw data access may enhance internal reasoning capabilities. Among all LLMs, GPT o3 was uniquely capable of correctly estimating its own specifications by executing self-generated code. Overall, the results demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of LLMs as assistive agents in choice modelling, not only for model specification but also for supporting modelling decision and estimation, and provide practical guidance for integrating these tools into choice modellers' workflows."}

We propose the quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key statistics in 2D turbulence.

SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation.

The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the software development process away from traditional areas such as design or technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-, technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future investigations of this paradigm."}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database. Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning. Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be open-sourced to support further research."}

This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language models (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL combinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction types. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their performance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and code comments.

CodeLMs fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection, demonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.

We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear).

As one building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods, the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating meaningful explanations."}

One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak inputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit unintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such unsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of training samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile, existing guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security constraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs. Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses harmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we propose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack training method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two modules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using reinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker identifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak data. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to address identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms used for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on complex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data. Additionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's over-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data generated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general benchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while preserving general performance."}

Several numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method: SAKE is thus able to perform more robust edits than its existing counterparts."}

Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation works in the opposite direction.

The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors, from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation are definable inductively on such syntax, and operate as a form of functor pre-composition. This approach introduces a modular, algebraic perspective in the theory of probabilistic graphical models."}

While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers an efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback, traditional DPO methods are limited by their reliance on single preference pairs. Recent work like Curriculum-DPO integrates multiple pairs using a one-dimensional difficulty curriculum based on pairwise distinguishability (PD), but overlooks the complexity of the input prompt itself. To address this, we propose 2D-Curri-DPO, a novel framework employing a two-dimensional curriculum that jointly models Prompt Complexity (PC) and Pairwise Distinguishability. This framework introduces dual difficulty metrics to quantify prompt semantic complexity and response preference clarity, defines a curriculum strategy space encompassing multiple selectable strategies for task adaptation, and incorporates a KL-divergence-based adaptive mechanism for dynamic reference model updates to enhance training stability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that 2D-Curri-DPO significantly outperforms standard DPO and prior curriculum methods across multiple benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Vicuna Bench, and WizardLM. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging test sets like UltraFeedback. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of the 2D structure and adaptive mechanisms, while analysis provides guidance for strategy selection. These findings demonstrate that effective alignment requires modeling both prompt complexity and pairwise distinguishability, establishing adaptive, multi-dimensional curriculum learning as a powerful and interpretable new paradigm for preference-based language model optimization."}

Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains.

Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts.

However, generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing them to students."}

We propose a framework, inspired by open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We revisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To make our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first establish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains over an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational processes. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary insights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We then address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis, using analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs. multi-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration in RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence of a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the evolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it gestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from origins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication offer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained reinforcement learning in biological systems."}

This is evinced using examples that juxtapose technology with cognition, inter alia: abacus versus mental arithmetic; alarm clock versus knocker-upper; camera versus vision; and sweatshop versus tailor. Using novel definitions and analyses, sociotechnical relationships can be analysed into varying types of: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and/or replacement (neutral) of human cognitive labour. Ultimately, all AI implicates human cognition; no matter what. Obfuscation of cognition in the AI context -- from clocks to artificial neural networks -- results in distortion, in slowing critical engagement, perverting cognitive science, and indeed in limiting our ability to truly centre humans and humanity in the engineering of AI systems.

The popular criticism that errors can compound during autoregressive inference, crucially assumes that teacher-forcing has learned an accurate next-token predictor. This assumption sidesteps a more deep-rooted problem we expose: in certain classes of tasks, teacher-forcing can simply fail to learn an accurate next-token predictor in the first place. We describe a general mechanism of how teacher-forcing can fail, and design a minimal planning task where both the Transformer and the Mamba architecture empirically fail in that manner -- remarkably, despite the task being straightforward to learn.Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that this failure can be resolved using _teacherless_ training, a simple modification using dummy tokens that predicts multiple tokens in advance.

In a horizon, the path planning and the path execution interleave, meaning when the path planning occurs for robots with no paths, the robots with outstanding paths do not execute, and subsequently, when the robots with new or outstanding paths execute to reach respective goals, path planning does not occur for those robots yet to get new paths, leading to wastage of both the robotic and the computation resources. As a remedy, we propose a centralized algorithm that is not horizon-based. It plans paths at any time for a subset of robots with no paths, i.e., who have reached their previously assigned goals, while the rest execute their outstanding paths, thereby enabling concurrent planning and execution. We formally prove that the proposed algorithm ensures complete coverage of an unknown workspace and analyze its time complexity. To demonstrate scalability, we evaluate our algorithm to cover eight large $2$D grid benchmark workspaces with up to 512 aerial and ground robots, respectively. A comparison with a state-of-the-art horizon-based algorithm shows its superiority in completing the coverage with up to 1.6x speedup.

For example, the LLM red-teaming literature has produced a wide variety of 'jailbreaking' techniques to elicit harmful text from models that were fine-tuned to be harmless. Recent work on red-teaming, model editing, and interpretability suggests that this challenge stems from how (adversarial) fine-tuning largely serves to suppress rather than remove undesirable capabilities from LLMs. Prior work has introduced latent adversarial training (LAT) as a way to improve robustness to broad classes of failures. These prior works have considered untargeted latent space attacks where the adversary perturbs latent activations to maximize loss on examples of desirable behavior. Untargeted LAT can provide a generic type of robustness but does not leverage information about specific failure modes. Here, we experiment with targeted LAT where the adversary seeks to minimize loss on a specific competing task. We find that it can augment a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods. First, we use targeted LAT to improve robustness to jailbreaks, outperforming a strong R2D2 baseline with orders of magnitude less compute. Second, we use it to more effectively remove backdoors with no knowledge of the trigger. Finally, we use it to more effectively unlearn knowledge for specific undesirable tasks in a way that is also more robust to re-learning. Overall, our results suggest that targeted LAT can be an effective tool for defending against harmful behaviors from LLMs."}

However, the potential and flexibility of KD can be greatly improved by expanding it to novel Cross-Architecture KD (CAKD), where the knowledge of homogeneous and heterogeneous teachers can be transferred flexibly to a given student. The primary challenge in CAKD lies in the substantial feature gaps between heterogeneous models, originating from the distinction of their inherent inductive biases and module functions. To this end, we introduce an assistant model as a bridge to facilitate smooth feature knowledge transfer between heterogeneous teachers and students. More importantly, within our proposed design principle, the assistant model combines the advantages of cross-architecture inductive biases and module functions by merging convolution and attention modules derived from both student and teacher module functions. Furthermore, we observe that heterogeneous features exhibit diverse spatial distributions in CAKD, hindering the effectiveness of conventional pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss. Therefore, we leverage a spatial-agnostic InfoNCE loss to align features after spatial smoothing, thereby improving the feature alignments in CAKD.

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (cross-reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new cross-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the training views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate cross-reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs. Find the project page atthis https URL."}

To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions.

A widely used representation corresponds to convex sets of probabilistic predictors, also known as credal sets. One popular way of constructing these credal sets is via ensembling or specialized supervised learning methods, where the epistemic uncertainty can be quantified through measures such as the set size or the disagreement among members. In principle, these sets should contain the true data-generating distribution. As a necessary condition for this validity, we adopt the strongest notion of calibration as a proxy. Concretely, we propose a novel statistical test to determine whether there is a convex combination of the set's predictions that is calibrated in distribution. In contrast to previous methods, our framework allows the convex combination to be instance dependent, recognizing that different ensemble members may be better calibrated in different regions of the input space. Moreover, we learn this combination via proper scoring rules, which inherently optimize for calibration.

However, it is computationally prohibitive due to massive, data-hungry text-based reward models. By changing the data source from text to hidden states, we introduce SWIFT (Simple Weighted Intrinsic Feedback Technique), a novel, lightweight technique that leverages the rich information embedded in LLM hidden states to address these issues, which operates on token-level and consists of only linear layers. Extensive experiments show that SWIFT outperforms baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only a few samples for training, demonstrating significant efficiency improvement. SWIFT's robust scalability, applicability to some closed-source models via logits, and ability to be combined with traditional reward models to yield further performance gains underscore its practical value."}

To address this, we propose Forward-Backward RAG (FB-RAG), a new training-free framework based on a simple yet powerful forward-looking strategy. FB-RAG employs a light-weight LLM to peek into potential future generations, using evidence from multiple sampled outputs to precisely identify the most relevant context for a final, more powerful generator. This improves performance without complex finetuning or Reinforcement Learning common in prior work. Across 9 datasets, FB-RAG consistently delivers strong results. Further, the performance gains can be achieved with reduced latency due to a shorter, more focused prompt for the powerful generator. Onthis http URLdataset, FB-RAG matches the leading baseline with over 48% latency reduction or achieves an 8% performance improvement with a 10% latency reduction. Our analysis finds cases where even when the forward-looking LLM fails to generate correct answers, its attempts are sufficient to guide the final model to an accurate response, demonstrating how smaller LLMs can systematically improve the performance and efficiency of larger ones."}

One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose RAIF, a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM.

Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose \"HeadHunter\", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies."}

Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility. Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task operations."}

These metrics are designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational relevance of the synthetic data.

The architecture mirrors the analytical form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension, so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real daily returns.

Quantization offers an effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However, existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations, which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream deployment tools."}

Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm. Our code is available at:this https URL."}

While it is often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI, Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small, consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis."}

A key challenge in fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age, and race) and other minority groups.

The results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.

This paper presents a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios, and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.

To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework with the mamba mechanism to model long-range dependencies. At the heart of Diff-UMamba is a noise reduction module, which employs a signal differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically significant regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings. Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including medical segmentation decathalon dataset (lung and pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over baseline methods in various segmentation tasks. To further assess performance under limited data conditions, additional experiments are conducted on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training samples.

Following two successful green hydrogen project rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce, with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions. Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI), which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate performance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk intelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical operational benchmarks."}

Sem-DPO adjusts the DPO loss using a weight based on how different the winning prompt is from the original, reducing the impact of training examples that are semantically misaligned. We provide the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12% higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1, PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

These approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals, limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats typically present in training datasets.These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training knowledge acquisition and response quality.

To address this issue, we introduce MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning, emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects.

This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news, encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency, coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional training or fine-tuning."}

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the training languages."}

The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself. A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator. Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech."}

Across 20 matched prompts spanning emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics, with a primary focus on curvature (\\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants. Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate, reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics. These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model alignment through the lens of Curved Inference."}

Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph, outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance, as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI applications in domain-specific fields."}

To bridge this gap, we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal, financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained domain-specific safety improvements.

This work investigates whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649 electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority, training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale coverage) compared to training on additional reports."}

This study investigates the extent to which LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives. Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with empirical survey patterns.

Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage ``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding natural-language text.

We evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination, they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text.

In this paper, we address the label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably, our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\\% increase in MMLU score). Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\\%."}

To solve this important problem, we introduce a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41 datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.

We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors.

We conducted controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current evaluation practices may fail to detect.

Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory.

An open question is how systematic this interpretation process is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they \"understand\" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of lowest complexity.

In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval."}

We crystallize this emerging concern and correct popular misconceptions surrounding it, and advocate a simple multi-token objective.As a starting point, we argue that the two often-conflated phases of next-token prediction -- autoregressive inference and teacher-forced training -- must be treated distinctly. The popular criticism that errors can compound during autoregressive inference, crucially assumes that teacher-forcing has learned an accurate next-token predictor. This assumption sidesteps a more deep-rooted problem we expose: in certain classes of tasks, teacher-forcing can simply fail to learn an accurate next-token predictor in the first place. We describe a general mechanism of how teacher-forcing can fail, and design a minimal planning task where both the Transformer and the Mamba architecture empirically fail in that manner -- remarkably, despite the task being straightforward to learn.Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that this failure can be resolved using _teacherless_ training, a simple modification using dummy tokens that predicts multiple tokens in advance.

Moreover, current sentence embedding models have limited context windows, hindering their ability to represent document-level information effectively. To address these challenges for Indic languages, we introduce PRALEKHA, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating document-level alignment techniques. It contains over 3 million aligned document pairs across 11 Indic languages and English, of which 1.5 million are English--Indic pairs.

We conduct probing experiments on 11 open-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs predominantly simulate personality for responding in their middle and upper layers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer separation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained probing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we propose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by LLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly specifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the response personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting between certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the representational distances in our probing experiments.

However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally important metric, which has received less attention.

In this work, we introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature activation probability, to identify language-specific features within the feed-forward network. We find that many such features predominantly appear in the middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features influence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be used for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along with more interpretability.

We select a dataset of human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11 different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability among human-written and machine-generated texts.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO adjusts the DPO loss using a weight based on how different the winning prompt is from the original, reducing the impact of training examples that are semantically misaligned. We provide the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12% higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1, PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

While widely adopted, it remains unclear whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters. This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.2%-14.3% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones -- underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality.

This unidirectional property makes them can only leverage past context but not future context. Though refinement-based models can exploit both past and future context by generating a new caption in the second stage based on pre-retrieved or pre-generated captions in the first stage, the decoder of these models generally consists of two networks~(i.e. a retriever or captioner in the first stage and a captioner in the second stage), which can only be executed sequentially. In this paper, we introduce a Compact Bidirectional Transformer model for image captioning that can leverage bidirectional context implicitly and explicitly while the decoder can be executed parallelly. Specifically, it is implemented by tightly coupling left-to-right(L2R) and right-to-left(R2L) flows into a single compact model to serve as a regularization for implicitly exploiting bidirectional context and optionally allowing explicit interaction of the bidirectional flows, while the final caption is chosen from either L2R or R2L flow in a sentence-level ensemble manner. We conduct extensive ablation studies on MSCOCO benchmark and find that the compact bidirectional architecture and the sentence-level ensemble play more important roles than the explicit interaction mechanism. By combining with word-level ensemble seamlessly, the effect of sentence-level ensemble is further enlarged. We further extend the conventional one-flow self-critical training to the two-flows version under this architecture and achieve new state-of-the-art results in comparison with non-vision-language-pretraining models. Finally, we verify the generality of this compact bidirectional architecture by extending it to LSTM backbone. Source code is available atthis https URL."}

For example, the LLM red-teaming literature has produced a wide variety of 'jailbreaking' techniques to elicit harmful text from models that were fine-tuned to be harmless. Recent work on red-teaming, model editing, and interpretability suggests that this challenge stems from how (adversarial) fine-tuning largely serves to suppress rather than remove undesirable capabilities from LLMs. Prior work has introduced latent adversarial training (LAT) as a way to improve robustness to broad classes of failures. These prior works have considered untargeted latent space attacks where the adversary perturbs latent activations to maximize loss on examples of desirable behavior. Untargeted LAT can provide a generic type of robustness but does not leverage information about specific failure modes. Here, we experiment with targeted LAT where the adversary seeks to minimize loss on a specific competing task. We find that it can augment a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods. First, we use targeted LAT to improve robustness to jailbreaks, outperforming a strong R2D2 baseline with orders of magnitude less compute. Second, we use it to more effectively remove backdoors with no knowledge of the trigger. Finally, we use it to more effectively unlearn knowledge for specific undesirable tasks in a way that is also more robust to re-learning. Overall, our results suggest that targeted LAT can be an effective tool for defending against harmful behaviors from LLMs."}

To align sign language with the LM, we leverage a decoupled tokenizer that discretizes continuous signs into token sequences representing various body parts. During decoding, unlike existing approaches that flatten all part-wise tokens into a single sequence and predict one token at a time, we propose a multi-head decoding method capable of predicting multiple tokens simultaneously. This approach improves inference efficiency while maintaining effective information fusion across different body parts.

One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose RAIF, a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement.

However, further enhancing existing MLLMs necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated, leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model, C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately. Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be released."}

Existing efficiency methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging, offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE (Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly reducing computational overhead.

Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries, MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution, MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous vehicles in complex environments."}

In general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \\underline{Du}al \\underline{C}ross-\\underline{i}mage \\underline{S}emantic \\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Relying on the dual paradigms, DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets, including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN."}

While most of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets, yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability. Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image, leading to more compact pairs of distillation.

A promising strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules. First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type. Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization."}

The Sun and fixed stars are the two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these, sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve accuracy.

Hence, network pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer, resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps, a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the art in CNN pruning.

Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4.

In this paper, we propose a method to generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training."}

These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches, which we call ``patch-level distribution shift\" and ``increased patch monotonicity.\" To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT), a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to high-resolution image generation."}

Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes (DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA) layers.

Our findings reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model simplification without sacrificing performance.

Existing methods can be roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training, showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules, including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results, and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate, their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate tracking.

Specifically, AdvRF reformulates FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently, the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets."}

To address this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19 state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the efficacy of SMFNet as well.

In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead, offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models."}

We also observe that, while the referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues. To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.

SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories, this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby enhancing the granularity of diagnosis.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and dynamic tool usage.

However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories: unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network (LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.

As one building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods, the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating meaningful explanations."}

However, these models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy, which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale foundation models in Robotics."}

In this paper, we initially re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.

Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni.

However, traditional AL methods, developed for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets (Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step recognition with fewer labeled videos.

Most existing ownership protection solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including classification, image generation, and text generation.

Although recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions. Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while substantially reducing the measurement burden."}

Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by 71%. Codes and models are available at $\\href{this https URL}{MixGRPO}$."}

We offer a new perspective on ultrasound video analysis through implicit neural representations (INRs). We build on Functa, an INR framework in which each image is represented by a modulation vector that conditions a shared neural network. However, its extension to the temporal domain of medical videos remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose VidFuncta, a novel framework that leverages Functa to encode variable-length ultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations. VidFuncta disentangles each video into a static video-specific vector and a sequence of time-dependent modulation vectors, capturing both temporal dynamics and dataset-level redundancies. Our method outperforms 2D and 3D baselines on video reconstruction and enables downstream tasks to directly operate on the learned 1D modulation vectors. We validate VidFuncta on three public ultrasound video datasets -- cardiac, lung, and breast -- and evaluate its downstream performance on ejection fraction prediction, B-line detection, and breast lesion classification. These results highlight the potential of VidFuncta as a generalizable and efficient representation framework for ultrasound videos. Our code is publicly available underthis https URL."}

This unidirectional property makes them can only leverage past context but not future context. Though refinement-based models can exploit both past and future context by generating a new caption in the second stage based on pre-retrieved or pre-generated captions in the first stage, the decoder of these models generally consists of two networks~(i.e. a retriever or captioner in the first stage and a captioner in the second stage), which can only be executed sequentially. In this paper, we introduce a Compact Bidirectional Transformer model for image captioning that can leverage bidirectional context implicitly and explicitly while the decoder can be executed parallelly. Specifically, it is implemented by tightly coupling left-to-right(L2R) and right-to-left(R2L) flows into a single compact model to serve as a regularization for implicitly exploiting bidirectional context and optionally allowing explicit interaction of the bidirectional flows, while the final caption is chosen from either L2R or R2L flow in a sentence-level ensemble manner. We conduct extensive ablation studies on MSCOCO benchmark and find that the compact bidirectional architecture and the sentence-level ensemble play more important roles than the explicit interaction mechanism. By combining with word-level ensemble seamlessly, the effect of sentence-level ensemble is further enlarged. We further extend the conventional one-flow self-critical training to the two-flows version under this architecture and achieve new state-of-the-art results in comparison with non-vision-language-pretraining models.

To address this issue, this paper presents a one-stage modality distillation framework that unifies the privileged knowledge transfer and modality information fusion into a single optimization procedure via multi-task learning. Compared with the conventional modality distillation that performs them independently, this helps to capture the valuable representation that can assist the final model inference directly. Specifically, we propose the joint adaptation network for the modality transfer task to preserve the privileged information. This addresses the representation heterogeneity caused by input discrepancy via the joint distribution adaptation. Then, we introduce the cross translation network for the modality fusion task to aggregate the restored and available modality features. It leverages the parameters-sharing strategy to capture the cross-modal cues explicitly.

Despite that deep learning methods have achieved remarkable performance, they heavily rely on labeled data, demanding extensive human annotation efforts. In this study, we present a novel human annotation-free method by leveraging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Without human annotation, pseudo-labels of the training set are obtained by utilizing the zero-shot inference capabilities of VLM, which may contain a lot of noise due to the domain gap between the pre-training and target datasets. To address this issue, we introduce VLM-CPL, a novel approach that contains two noisy label filtering techniques with a semi-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, we first obtain prompt-based pseudo-labels with uncertainty estimation by zero-shot inference with the VLM using multiple augmented views of an input. Then, by leveraging the feature representation ability of VLM, we obtain feature-based pseudo-labels via sample clustering in the feature space. Prompt-feature consensus is introduced to select reliable samples based on the consensus between the two types of pseudo-labels. We further propose High-confidence Cross Supervision by to learn from samples with reliable pseudo-labels and the remaining unlabeled samples. Additionally, we present an innovative open-set prompting strategy that filters irrelevant patches from whole slides to enhance the quality of selected patches.

Consequently, this paper focuses on addressing the challenging yet practical few-shot online anomaly detection and segmentation (FOADS) task.

One fundamental operation applied to such representations is differentiable rendering, as it enables inverse graphics approaches in learning frameworks. Standard explicit shape representations (voxels, point clouds, or meshes) are often easily rendered, but can suffer from limited geometric fidelity, among other issues. On the other hand, implicit representations (occupancy, distance, or radiance fields) preserve greater fidelity, but suffer from complex or inefficient rendering processes, limiting scalability. In this work, we devise Directed Distance Fields (DDFs), a novel neural shape representation that builds upon classical distance fields. The fundamental operation in a DDF maps an oriented point (position and direction) to surface visibility and depth. This enables efficient differentiable rendering, obtaining depth with a single forward pass per pixel, as well as differential geometric quantity extraction (e.g., surface normals), with only additional backward passes. Using probabilistic DDFs (PDDFs), we show how to model inherent discontinuities in the underlying field. We then apply DDFs to several applications, including single-shape fitting, generative modelling, and single-image 3D reconstruction, showcasing strong performance with simple architectural components via the versatility of our representation. Finally, since the dimensionality of DDFs permits view-dependent geometric artifacts, we conduct a theoretical investigation of the constraints necessary for view consistency.

However, its greedy-selection memory design suffers from the \"error accumulation\" problem, where an errored or missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent frames, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos. To this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object segmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each frame and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation pathways in a constrained tree search manner.

Such an advanced technology is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to decrease the cost and risk of tedious traditional inspection methods. To this end, we performed extensive tests employing a research reinforced concrete bridge that can be exposed to a predefined load via ground anchors. Very high-resolution image blocks have been captured before, during, and after the application of controlled loads. From those images, the motion of distinct points on the bridge has been monitored, and in addition, dense image point clouds were computed to evaluate the performance of surface-based data acquisition. Moreover, a geodetic control network in stable regions is used as control information for bundle adjustment. We applied different sensing technologies in order to be able to judge the image-based deformation results: displacement transducers, tachymetry, and laser profiling. As a platform for the photogrammetric measurements, a multi-rotor UAV DJI Matrice 600 Pro was employed, equipped with two RTK-GNSS receivers. The mounted camera was a PhaseOne iXM-100 (100MP) with an 80 mm lens.

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (cross-reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new cross-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the training views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate cross-reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs. Find the project page atthis https URL."}

In this work, we introduce a multilingual sign language model, Signs as Tokens (SOKE), which can generate 3D sign avatars autoregressively from text inputs using a pretrained LM. To align sign language with the LM, we leverage a decoupled tokenizer that discretizes continuous signs into token sequences representing various body parts. During decoding, unlike existing approaches that flatten all part-wise tokens into a single sequence and predict one token at a time, we propose a multi-head decoding method capable of predicting multiple tokens simultaneously. This approach improves inference efficiency while maintaining effective information fusion across different body parts.

In contrast, NeRFs capture fine details but have yet to be effectively integrated with category-level priors in a real-time multi-object mapping framework. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRENOM, a Prior-based Efficient Neural Object Mapper that integrates category-level priors with object-level NeRFs to enhance reconstruction efficiency and enable canonical object pose estimation.

We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction.

Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose \"HeadHunter\", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance.

However, it requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective, reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current.

Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including medical segmentation decathalon dataset (lung and pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over baseline methods in various segmentation tasks. To further assess performance under limited data conditions, additional experiments are conducted on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung cancer dataset for the segmentation of gross tumor volume in cone beam CT, where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over baseline."}

Although many detection models have been developed and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content, one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues. In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications."}

Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability. To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset, KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization setting with unseen ID categories.

Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion, perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading, reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame weighted adjustments.

To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion.

Building on the observation that retrieval models often favor AI-generated content in ad-hoc and image retrieval tasks, we investigate whether similar biases emerge in the context of challenging video retrieval, where temporal and visual factors may further influence model behavior. To explore this, we first construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing both real and AI-generated videos, along with a set of fair and rigorous metrics to assess bias. This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by two state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously design a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference, accounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and suboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video retrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our findings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval. Further investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the training set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference observed in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from both unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video bias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we fine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach.

Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal information integration to ensure robust perception.

This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's 7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally, we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems."}

However, in this context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations.

Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large, hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small, non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and scanner/age variations in MRI.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks.

The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail (minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled samples."}

Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular), and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows."}

Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry, resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in the preceding decoding step.

While recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving differential equations through continuous integration, making training and inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs.

Within the SA, we propose a versatile processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around ~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel operations."}

Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation. Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9.

Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy graph."}

In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance.

Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts, exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However, text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs: multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting (DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into coarse-grained text prompts.

Yet this very nature also makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e. the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets. Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework."}

This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability, PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy."}

A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available (i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2) leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance after unlearning.

In this work, inspired by the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing, grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data, we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of 19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full mathematical interpretability.

The theory shows that nonlinear activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these predictions.

Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear, constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix. This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena."}

LLMs are pre-trained on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation feature, our model, \"AdLlama,\" powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale 10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7% (p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads. This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the tangible impact of RL post-training.

In this paper, we introduce FedFlex, a federated recommender system for Netflix-style TV series recommendations. FedFlex integrates two state-of-the-art matrix factorization algorithms for personalized fine-tuning. FedFlex also applies Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to re-rank items and enhance diversity. We conduct extensive experiments comparing recommendations generated by SVD and BPR algorithms. In a live two-week user study, participants received two recommendation lists: List A, based on SVD or BPR, and List B, a re-ranked version emphasizing diversity. Participants were asked to click on the movies they were interested in watching. Our findings demonstrate that FedFlex effectively introduces diverse content, such as new genres, into recommendations without necessarily compromising user satisfaction."}

Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile, evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for inaccuracies in LLM-generated content.

Users initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull\"). The system leverages image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks. By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility, VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific visualization."}

This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained domain-specific safety improvements.

However, it lacks explicit component selection rules, necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover, existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially achieving ACC of 65.47\\% compared to the 56.12\\% achieved by GPT-4 on the Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline."}

This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval, optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively. Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent, greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content.

While these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to clean examples.

Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed trigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely matching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on model outputs. Second, we utilize these perturbation triggers to generate benign adversarial perturbations that disrupt the model's dependence on backdoor triggers while forcing it to learn more robust decision boundaries. Finally, we design an adaptive scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust perturbation intensity, effectively balancing defense strength and model performance.

The network feedforward involves qubit rotations whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing $a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter. We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the neural network circuits.

This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation, transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior, demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading conditions.

Unlike magnetometers, gyroscopes can provide accurate heading reference independent of the magnetic disturbances in a process known as gyrocompassing.

Such challenges are commonly addressed in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, where size, weight, and power limitations restrict sensor quality, and noisy measurements severely degrade gyrocompassing performance. To cope with this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass approach. It integrates a diffusion-based denoising framework with an enhanced learning-based heading estimation model. The diffusion denoiser processes raw inertial sensor signals before input to the deep learning model, resulting in accurate gyrocompassing. Experiments using both simulated and real sensor data demonstrate that our proposed approach improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% compared to model-based gyrocompassing and by 15% compared to other learning-driven approaches.

Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN algorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature, necessitating a large amount of compute.

Learned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and high quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative neural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior distribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification. Our RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative adversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net) architecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement operator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat mode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach takes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the observation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are robust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased dynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods provide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes."}

After filtering for singleton births with one or two prior cesareans and complete data across 47 prenatal-period features, three classifiers were trained: logistic regression, XGBoost, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The MLP achieved the highest performance with an AUC of 0.7287, followed closely by XGBoost (AUC = 0.727), both surpassing the logistic regression baseline (AUC = 0.709). To address class imbalance, class weighting was applied to the MLP, and a custom loss function was implemented in XGBoost. Evaluation metrics included ROC curves, confusion matrices, and precision-recall analysis. Logistic regression coefficients highlighted maternal BMI, education, parity, comorbidities, and prenatal care indicators as key predictors.

The GNN-based discrete choice models (GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture dependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to classical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the GNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated logit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic interpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities. Empirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural networks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77 community areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture individual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns.

PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test for membership inference.

Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries, MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution, MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous vehicles in complex environments."}

In this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by proving that under a mild assumption on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) stability, these same regions satisfy a local Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. We introduce the concept of a Locally Polyak-Lojasiewicz Region (LPLR), where the squared gradient norm lower-bounds the suboptimality gap, prove that properly initialized finite-width networks admit such regions around initialization, and establish that GD achieves linear convergence within an LPLR, providing the first finite-width guarantee that matches empirically observed rates. We validate our theory across diverse settings, from controlled experiments on fully-connected networks to modern ResNet architectures trained with stochastic methods, demonstrating that LPLR structure emerges robustly in practical deep learning scenarios.

Our theoretical framework provides the first structure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate inference. Empirically, we demonstrate that a moment-based CD dramatically outperforms standard diagnostics like effective sample size for hyperparameter selection in biased MCMC, correctly identifying optimal configurations where traditional methods fail. Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect subtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank correlation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical Kendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior.

Games have dominated RL benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\\times$ faster when vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for assistive robotics.

The learning rate is one of such crucial hyperparameters, which is usually kept static during the training process. Learning dynamics in complex systems often requires a more adaptive approach to the learning rate. This adaptability becomes crucial to effectively navigate varying gradients and optimize the learning process during the training process. In this paper, a dynamic learning rate scheduler (DLRS) algorithm is presented that adapts the learning rate based on the loss values calculated during the training process.

The two tasks may then be performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical conditions for spinodal decomposition.

However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets.

Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared, embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100 natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images. Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared, modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external world."}

We propose the quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution."}

However, optimizations for fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper, we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition, and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target efficiently."}

Using mean-field theory and its dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns.

We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear).

For example, the LLM red-teaming literature has produced a wide variety of 'jailbreaking' techniques to elicit harmful text from models that were fine-tuned to be harmless. Recent work on red-teaming, model editing, and interpretability suggests that this challenge stems from how (adversarial) fine-tuning largely serves to suppress rather than remove undesirable capabilities from LLMs. Prior work has introduced latent adversarial training (LAT) as a way to improve robustness to broad classes of failures. These prior works have considered untargeted latent space attacks where the adversary perturbs latent activations to maximize loss on examples of desirable behavior. Untargeted LAT can provide a generic type of robustness but does not leverage information about specific failure modes. Here, we experiment with targeted LAT where the adversary seeks to minimize loss on a specific competing task. We find that it can augment a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods. First, we use targeted LAT to improve robustness to jailbreaks, outperforming a strong R2D2 baseline with orders of magnitude less compute. Second, we use it to more effectively remove backdoors with no knowledge of the trigger. Finally, we use it to more effectively unlearn knowledge for specific undesirable tasks in a way that is also more robust to re-learning.

We address this by introducing Ehrlich functions, a synthetic test suite that captures the geometric structure of biophysical sequence optimization problems. With prompting alone, off-the-shelf LLMs struggle to optimize Ehrlich functions. In response, we propose LLOME (Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation), a bilevel optimization routine for online black-box optimization.

Furthermore, we propose a provably convergent algorithm for policy optimization using preference-inferred reward cones. Our results bridge the gap between practical alignment techniques and theoretical guarantees, providing a principled foundation for learning aligned behaviors in a high-dimension and value-pluralistic environment."}

Extensive experiments show that SWIFT outperforms baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only a few samples for training, demonstrating significant efficiency improvement.

These requirements are often enforced via penalization--adding fixed-weight terms to the task loss. We argue this approach is fundamentally ill-suited since there may be no penalty coefficient that simultaneously ensures constraint satisfaction and optimal constrained performance, i.e., that truly solves the constrained problem. Moreover, tuning these coefficients requires costly trial-and-error, incurring significant time and computational overhead. We, therefore, advocate for broader adoption of tailored constrained optimization methods--such as the Lagrangian approach, which jointly optimizes the penalization \"coefficients\" (the Lagrange multipliers) and the model parameters. Such methods (i) truly solve the constrained problem and do so accountably, by clearly defining feasibility and verifying when it is achieved, (ii) eliminate the need for extensive penalty tuning, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with modern deep learning pipelines."}

Unlike most existing methods that rely on proxy metrics, our approach represents novel methodology for training any neural network architecture on any data modality to identify prognostically distinct patient groups. We thoroughly evaluate the method in simulation experiments and demonstrate its utility in practice by applying it to two distinct cancer types: analyzing laboratory parameters from multiple myeloma patients and computed tomography images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, identifying prognostically distinct patient subgroups with significantly different survival outcomes in both cases. Post-hoc explainability analyses uncover clinically meaningful features determining the group assignments which align well with established risk factors and thus lend strong weight to the methods utility. This pan-cancer, model-agnostic approach represents a valuable advancement in clinical risk stratification, enabling the discovery of novel prognostic signatures across diverse data types while providing interpretable results that promise to complement treatment personalization and clinical decision-making in oncology and beyond."}

Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility. Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task operations."}

For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings, it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm, although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience.

We design a lightweight contextual bandit agent that dynamically selects the optimal aggregation rule from an arsenal of defenses based on real-time diagnostic metrics.

The most crucial one is inpatient beds. To ensure bed availability, hospitals may use machine learning (ML) models to predict patients' length-of-stay (LOS) in the admission planning stage. However, the real value of the LOS for each patient may differ from the predicted one, potentially making the schedule infeasible. To address such infeasibilities, it is possible to implement rescheduling strategies that take advantage of operational flexibility. For example, planners may postpone admission dates, relocate patients to different wards, or even transfer patients who are already admitted among wards. A straightforward assumption is that better LOS predictions can help reduce the impact of rescheduling. However, the training process of ML models that can make such accurate predictions can be very costly. Building on previous work that proposed simulated ML for evaluating data-driven approaches, this paper explores the relationship between LOS prediction accuracy and rescheduling flexibility across various corrective policies.

Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR.

While it is often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI, Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small, consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis."}

Following two successful green hydrogen project rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region.

Despite growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce, with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions. Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI), which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate performance claims over time.

The popular criticism that errors can compound during autoregressive inference, crucially assumes that teacher-forcing has learned an accurate next-token predictor. This assumption sidesteps a more deep-rooted problem we expose: in certain classes of tasks, teacher-forcing can simply fail to learn an accurate next-token predictor in the first place.

In this work, we devise Directed Distance Fields (DDFs), a novel neural shape representation that builds upon classical distance fields. The fundamental operation in a DDF maps an oriented point (position and direction) to surface visibility and depth. This enables efficient differentiable rendering, obtaining depth with a single forward pass per pixel, as well as differential geometric quantity extraction (e.g., surface normals), with only additional backward passes. Using probabilistic DDFs (PDDFs), we show how to model inherent discontinuities in the underlying field. We then apply DDFs to several applications, including single-shape fitting, generative modelling, and single-image 3D reconstruction, showcasing strong performance with simple architectural components via the versatility of our representation. Finally, since the dimensionality of DDFs permits view-dependent geometric artifacts, we conduct a theoretical investigation of the constraints necessary for view consistency. We find a small set of field properties that are sufficient to guarantee a DDF is consistent, without knowing, for instance, which shape the field is expressing."}

In this work, we introduce BEACON, a sample-efficient, Bayesian optimization-inspired approach to NS that is tailored for settings where the input-to-behavior relationship is opaque and costly to evaluate. BEACON models this mapping using multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) and selects new inputs by maximizing a novelty metric computed from posterior samples of the MOGP, effectively balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. By leveraging recent advances in posterior sampling and high-dimensional GP modeling, our method remains scalable to large input spaces and datasets.

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (cross-reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new cross-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the training views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate cross-reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references.

Matrix completion is a widely used statistical framework for such systems, aiming to predict a user's preferences for items they have not yet rated by leveraging the observed ratings in a partially filled user-item rating matrix. Realistic applications of matrix completion in recommender systems must address several challenges that are too often neglected: (i) the discrete nature of rating-scale data, (ii) the presence of malicious users who manipulate the system to their advantage through the creation of fake profiles, and (iii) missing-not-at-random patterns, where users are more likely to rate items they expect to enjoy. Our goal in this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel matrix completion method, robust discrete matrix completion (RDMC), designed specifically to handle the discrete nature of sparse rating-scale data and to remain reliable in the presence of adversarial manipulation. We evaluate RDMC through carefully designed experiments and realistic case studies. Our work therefore, secondly, offers a statistically-sound blueprint for future studies on how to evaluate matrix completion methods for recommender systems under realistic scenarios."}

One of the key requirements for achieving attribute manipulation on human motion is a suitable pose representation. Therefore, we design a novel continuous, rotation-based pose representation that enables the disentanglement of the human skeleton and the motion trajectory, while still allowing an accurate reconstruction of the original anatomy. The core idea of the manipulation approach is to use a transformer encoder for discovering high-level semantics, and a diffusion probabilistic model for modeling the remaining stochastic variations. We show that the embedding space obtained from the transformer encoder is semantically meaningful and linear. This enables the manipulation of high-level attributes, by discovering their linear direction of change in the semantic embedding space and moving the embedding along said direction.

A key step toward this goal is estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) - the way treatments impact different subgroups. While crucial, HTE estimation is challenging with survival data, where time until an event (e.g., death) is key. Existing methods often assume complete observation, an assumption violated in survival data due to right-censoring, leading to bias and inefficiency. Cui et al. (2023) proposed a doubly-robust method for HTE estimation in survival data under no hidden confounders, combining a causal survival forest with an augmented inverse-censoring weighting estimator. However, we find it struggles under heavy censoring, which is common in rare-outcome problems such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, most current methods cannot handle instrumental variables, which are a crucial tool in the causal inference arsenal. We introduce Multiple Imputation for Survival Treatment Response (MISTR), a novel, general, and non-parametric method for estimating HTE in survival data. MISTR uses recursively imputed survival trees to handle censoring without directly modeling the censoring mechanism. Through extensive simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets-the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 175 and the Illinois unemployment dataset we show that MISTR outperforms prior methods under heavy censoring in the no-hidden-confounders setting, and extends to the instrumental variable setting.

We investigated its potential for versatile EEG decoding, evaluating performance in a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, we show that EEG-CLIP manages to non-trivially align text and EEG representations.

One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose RAIF, a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Evaluation on OOD constraints also confirms the generalizability of our RAIF.

Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose \"HeadHunter\", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies."}

However, further enhancing existing MLLMs necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated, leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model, C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately. Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO adjusts the DPO loss using a weight based on how different the winning prompt is from the original, reducing the impact of training examples that are semantically misaligned. We provide the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12% higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1, PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language models."}

Poor-quality answers can introduce inefficiencies, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, and thus increase maintenance costs and technical debt in production software. To improve content quality, SO allows collaborative editing, where users revise answers to enhance clarity, correctness, and formatting. Several studies have examined rejected edits and identified the causes of rejection. However, prior research has not systematically assessed whether accepted edits enhance key quality dimensions. While one study investigated the impact of edits on C/C++ vulnerabilities, broader quality aspects remain unexplored. In this study, we analyze 94,994 Python-related answers that have at least one accepted edit to determine whether edits improve (1) semantic relevance, (2) code usability, (3) code complexity, (4) security vulnerabilities, (5) code optimization, and (6) readability. Our findings show both positive and negative effects of edits. While 53.3% of edits improve how well answers match questions, 38.1% make them less relevant. Some previously broken code (9%) becomes executable, yet working code (14.7%) turns non-parsable after edits. Many edits increase complexity (32.3%), making code harder to maintain. Instead of fixing security issues, 20.5% of edits introduce additional issues. Even though 51.0% of edits optimize performance, execution time still increases overall. Readability also suffers, as 49.7% of edits make code harder to read. This study highlights the inconsistencies in editing outcomes and provides insights into how edits impact software maintainability, security, and efficiency that might caution users and moderators and help future improvements in collaborative editing systems."}

It requires deep domain expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection in MAS-driven architecture design."}

Hallucinations are a major concern when LLMs are applied blindly to problems without taking the time and effort to verify their outputs, and an inability to explain the logical reasoning of LLMs leads to issues with trusting their results. To address these challenges while also aiming to effectively apply LLMs, this paper proposes a dual-LLM system (i.e. a generative LLM and a discriminative LLM) and experiments with the usage of LLMs for the generation of a large volume of compiler tests. We experimented with a number of LLMs possessing varying parameter counts and presented results using ten carefully-chosen metrics that we describe in detail in our narrative.

The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction. complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type prediction, and bug correction with the same model.

In this work, we introduce ``maintenance cessation'', grounded in both explicit archival status and rigorous semantic analysis of project documentation. Building on this foundation, we curate a large-scale, longitudinal dataset of 115,466 GitHub repositories -- encompassing 57,733 confirmed cessation events -- complemented by comprehensive, timeline-based behavioral features. We propose an integrated, multi-perspective feature framework for predicting maintenance cessation, systematically combining user-centric features, maintainer-centric features and project evolution features. AFT survival analysis demonstrates a high C-index (0.846), substantially outperforming models relying only on surface features. Feature ablation and SHAP analysis further confirm the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach.

Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the software development process away from traditional areas such as design or technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and ecosystem bias.

However, optimizations for fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper, we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition, and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target efficiently."}

These issues create a significant \"generalization gap\" where models achieve misleading self-testing performance (measured on held-out data from same dataset for training) by exploiting spurious correlations rather than learning true vulnerability patterns. Our analysis reveals that many models experience substantial performance drops of up to 40.6% when evaluated on independent data, sometimes underperforming random guessing.To address these limitations, we present a three-part solution. First, we introduce a manually curated test dataset, BenchVul, covering the MITRE Top 25 Most Dangerous CWEs. Second, we construct a high-quality training dataset, TitanVul, comprising 35,045 functions by aggregating seven public sources and applying deduplication and validation using a novel multi-agent LLM framework. Third, we propose a Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) framework, which synthesizes context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented but critical CWE types through simulated development workflows.Our evaluation shows the strengths of each component in closing the generalization gap. First, BenchVul shows the limitations of self-testing: models trained on existing datasets, such as BigVul and PrimeVul, experience performance drops on BenchVul (from 0.776 to 0.519 and from 0.567 to 0.337). Second, training models on TitanVul demonstrates improved generalization, with model performance increasing from 0.584 when evaluated on the same dataset to 0.767 when tested on BenchVul.

This research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT, DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1 score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and potential usages."}

Large Language Models (LLMs), capable of retaining information long-term and analyzing both visual and textual data, are emerging as a potential key to deciphering the complexities of VR's evolving user interfaces. In this paper, we conduct a case study to investigate the capability of using LLMs, particularly GPT-4o, for field of view (FOV) analysis in VR exploration testing. Specifically, we validate that LLMs can identify test entities in FOVs and that prompt engineering can effectively enhance the accuracy of test entity identification from 41.67% to 71.30%. Our study also shows that LLMs can accurately describe identified entities' features with at least a 90% accuracy rate. We further find out that the core features that effectively represent an entity are color, placement, and shape. Furthermore, the combination of the three features can especially be used to improve the accuracy of determining identical entities in multiple FOVs with the highest F1-score of 0.70. Additionally, our study demonstrates that LLMs are capable of scene recognition and spatial understanding in VR with precisely designed structured prompts. Finally, we find that LLMs fail to label the identified test entities, and we discuss potential solutions as future research directions."}

However, traditional testing approaches involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities, providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose iPanda, the first framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes retrieval-augmented generation and customized CoT strategy to effectively interpret the implementation and produce executable test programs. To further enhance programs' quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative optimization mechanism to refine generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-program generation by factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times."}

Debugging remains unsolved despite these advances. While Claude Opus 4 and GPT-4.1 achieve >70% on code synthesis benchmarks, they perform <15% on real debugging tasks. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a language model built specifically for debugging. Chronos combines Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval to navigate codebases up to 10 million lines using multi-hop traversal (92% precision, 85% recall), Persistent Debug Memory trained on 15M+ sessions, and a 7-layer architecture for iterative fix-test-refine loops. On 5,000 real-world scenarios, Chronos achieves 67.3% fix accuracy, compared to 14.2% and 13.8% for Claude and GPT-4.1 respectively. Chronos reduces debugging time by 40% and iteration count by 65%. It resolves complex multi-file bugs involving cross-repository context and temporal reasoning. Key limitations include 23.4% success on hardware-dependent issues and 41.2% on dynamic language errors. Theoretical analysis shows O(k log d) retrieval complexity with convergence guarantees. In a human evaluation (N=50), 89% of participants preferred Chronos over baseline models. Chronos will be available in Kodezi OS in Q4 2025 and via API in Q1 2026."}
