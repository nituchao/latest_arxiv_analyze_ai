Motivated by the recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore, we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible, adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise, interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial."}

Reasoning large language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA (Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive workflows in agent design for data analysis."}

Implemented using LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to 1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4% improvement.

In this work, we introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular, task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging. For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name. These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent\" runs the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps.

ED triage notes, containing expert, succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field.

In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs and max GNNs.

Inspired by dual-system cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval (Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our framework not only helps understand LLMs from a \"decoupling\" perspective, but also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws, hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning."}

Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights, incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights.

The application uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540 clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63) of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n = 66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally, we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves conciseness.

Following pre-processing of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations). Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from 0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce environments.

However, recent studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes? Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models, including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural networks and their recent development for foundation models.

This sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias. Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt -- and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of 81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of 87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off relative to our original early-stopping method."}

Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate) the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core design principle.

Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28 entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for continuous T2I model safety evaluation."}

However, existing studies face three major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2) introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals; and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework, which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3 improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset."}

Despite these distortions, we uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models.

Previous studies have mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and 52% for GPTZero.

The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.

To address these limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred outputs.

However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting transitions.To address this, we propose the \\textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV) dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \\textbf{TAV} dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality."}

In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional instructions.

Despite their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias, potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed. These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care."}

Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary, as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about tokenization robustness.

It then redistributes the answer slot according to the inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability of selecting the correct answer by chance.

This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and RL's treatment of intertemporal costs.

In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries, researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning. Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach."}

The synergistic reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction. Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning, (3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically, the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability and generalization. Code and videos atthis https URL."}

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings). We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the \"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers."}

To address this gap, we present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks.

While existing DT research primarily centers on asset transfer, the significance of \"sim-to-real transfer\" and \"real-to-sim transfer\"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key challenge in this process is calibrating the \"reality gap,\" the discrepancy between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the historical repository and the simulation model.

We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing, corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text, especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to check for the existence of any sensitive information.

Rahmani,Emine Yilmaz,David Barber", "title": "Beyond Internal Data: Constructing Complete Datasets for Fairness Testing", "abstract": "As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge. Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data. Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features. We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data, and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work, therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited."}

However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC. Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art results in several scenarios.

Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.

To bridge this gap and achieve a step closer towards human-centered XAI, we present I-CEE, a framework that provides Image Classification Explanations tailored to User Expertise. Informed by existing work, I-CEE explains the decisions of image classification models by providing the user with an informative subset of training data (i.e., example images), corresponding local explanations, and model decisions.

We posit that by tailoring the example set to user expertise, I-CEE can better facilitate users' understanding and simulatability of the model. To evaluate our approach, we conduct detailed experiments in both simulation and with human participants (N = 100) on multiple datasets.

In this context, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for extracting causal knowledge from text-based metadata, which consolidates domain expertise. However, LLMs tend to be unreliable and prone to hallucinations, necessitating strategies that account for their limitations. One effective strategy is to use a consistency measure to assess reliability. Additionally, most text metadata does not clearly distinguish direct causal relationships from indirect ones, further complicating the discovery of a causal DAG. As a result, focusing on causal orders, rather than causal DAGs, emerges as a more practical and robust approach. We present a new method to derive a class of acyclic tournaments, which represent plausible causal orders, maximizing a consistency score derived from an LLM. Our approach starts by calculating pairwise consistency scores between variables, resulting in a semi-complete partially directed graph that consolidates these scores into an abstraction of the maximally consistent causal orders. Using this structure, we identify optimal acyclic tournaments, focusing on those that maximize consistency across all configurations. We subsequently show how both the abstraction and the class of causal orders can be used to estimate causal effects. We tested our method on both well-established benchmarks, as well as, real-world datasets from epidemiology and public health. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in recovering the correct causal order."}

Here we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can serve as powerful tools enabling chemical analysis. When integrated with traditional search algorithms, they enable a new approach to computer-aided synthesis that mirrors human expert thinking. Rather than using LLMs to directly manipulate chemical structures, we leverage their ability to evaluate chemical strategies and guide search algorithms toward chemically meaningful solutions. We demonstrate this paradigm through two fundamental challenges: strategy-aware retrosynthetic planning and mechanism elucidation. In retrosynthetic planning, our system allows chemists to specify desired synthetic strategies in natural language -- from protecting group strategies to global feasibility assessment -- and uses traditional or LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to find routes that satisfy these constraints. In mechanism elucidation, LLMs guide the search for plausible reaction mechanisms by combining chemical principles with systematic exploration. This approach shows strong performance across diverse chemical tasks, with newer and larger models demonstrating increasingly sophisticated chemical reasoning. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for computer-aided chemistry that combines the strategic understanding of LLMs with the precision of traditional chemical tools, opening possibilities for more intuitive and powerful chemical automation systems."}

Most existing approaches attempt to improve OR problem-solving through prompt engineering or fine-tuning strategies for LLMs. However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the limited capabilities of non-reasoning LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose OR-LLM-Agent, an AI agent built on reasoning LLMs for automated OR problem solving. The agent decomposes the task into three sequential stages: mathematical modeling, code generation, and debugging. Each task is handled by a dedicated sub-agent, which enables more targeted reasoning. We also construct BWOR, a high-quality dataset for evaluating LLM performance on OR tasks. Our analysis shows that existing benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR suffer from certain issues, making them less suitable for reliably evaluating LLM performance. In contrast, BWOR provides a more consistent and discriminative assessment of model capabilities.

Unlike other tests, this test does not rely on statistical compression methods (such as GZIP or LZW), which are more closely related to Shannon entropy than to Kolmogorov complexity and are not able to test beyond simple pattern matching. The test challenges aspects of AI, in particular LLMs, related to features of intelligence of fundamental nature such as synthesis and model creation in the context of inverse problems (generating new knowledge from observation). We argue that metrics based on model abstraction and abduction (optimal Bayesian `inference') for predictive `planning' can provide a robust framework for testing intelligence, including natural intelligence (human and animal), narrow AI, AGI, and ASI. We found that LLM model versions tend to be fragile and incremental as a result of memorisation only with progress likely driven by the size of training data. The results were compared with a hybrid neurosymbolic approach that theoretically guarantees universal intelligence based on the principles of algorithmic probability and Kolmogorov complexity. The method outperforms LLMs in a proof-of-concept on short binary sequences. We prove that compression is equivalent and directly proportional to a system's predictive power and vice versa. That is, if a system can better predict it can better compress, and if it can better compress, then it can better predict. Our findings strengthen the suspicion regarding the fundamental limitations of LLMs, exposing them as systems optimised for the perception of mastery over human language."}

Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts.

Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies, adaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with our automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating our methodology.

We explore how misalignment may serve and should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with whichever agents are most aligned to human interests, ensuring that no single system dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that misalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility from Turing-complete systems, which we also offer as a proof in this contribution, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We introduce a change-of-opinion attack test based on perturbation and intervention analysis to study how humans and agents may change or neutralise friendly and unfriendly AIs through cooperation and competition. We show that open models are more diverse and that most likely guardrails implemented in proprietary models are successful at controlling some of the agents' range of behaviour with positive and negative consequences while closed systems are more steerable and can also be used against proprietary AI systems.

The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), thus falling within the remit of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-Theta is employed to optimize the RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. The active beamforming at the BS is then derived from the jointly optimized RIS phase shifts and subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize the subcarrier allocation indicators more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture the network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, such as the number of backlogged packets in buffers and current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance the training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods."}

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment, robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy improvement up to 9.71%."}

We apply this framework to two high-risk fields: misinformation spread and e-commerce fraud.

The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them to adapt their strategies and cause more damage.

To overcome this, we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the model \"thinks\" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and control."}

Existing task- or model- agnostic unlearning approaches, primarily designed for classification tasks, are suboptimal for NuMuR due to two core challenges: (1) neural rankers output unnormalised relevance scores rather than probability distributions, limiting the effectiveness of traditional teacher-student distillation frameworks; and (2) entangled data scenarios, where queries and documents appear simultaneously across both forget and retain sets, may degrade retention performance in existing methods. To address these issues, we propose Contrastive and Consistent Loss (CoCoL), a dual-objective framework. CoCoL comprises (1) a contrastive loss that reduces relevance scores on forget sets while maintaining performance on entangled samples, and (2) a consistent loss that preserves accuracy on retain set. Extensive experiments on MS MARCO and TREC CAR datasets, across four neural IR models, demonstrate that CoCoL achieves substantial forgetting with minimal retain and generalisation performance loss. Our method facilitates more effective and controllable data removal than existing techniques."}

However, the complexity of simulating quantum systems poses a significant challenge to computer-aided design of quantum chips, especially for large-scale chips. Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here propose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called 'three-stair scaling' mechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly trained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a designer unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to large-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk errors. Frequencies for both single- and two-qubit gates (corresponding to the parameters of nodes and edges) are considered simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages in efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, our GNNs-based algorithm achieves 51% of the errors produced by the state-of-the-art algorithm, with a time reduction from 90 min to 27 sec.

This paper summarizes areas where QC promises unprecedented computational power, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostics, personalized treatments, and enhanced drug discovery processes. However, integrating quantum technologies into precision medicine also presents challenges, including errors in algorithms and high costs. We show that mathematically-based techniques for specifying, developing, and verifying software (formal methods) can enhance the reliability and correctness of QC. By providing a rigorous mathematical framework, formal methods help to specify, develop, and verify systems with high precision. In genomic data analysis, formal specification languages can precisely (1) define the behavior and properties of quantum algorithms designed to identify genetic markers associated with diseases. Model checking tools can systematically explore all possible states of the algorithm to (2) ensure it behaves correctly under all conditions, while theorem proving techniques provide mathematical (3) proof that the algorithm meets its specified properties, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

Our method enables faster training of student models with marginal overhead (<10%) compared to cross-entropy based training, while maintaining competitive performance compared to full distillation, across a range of model sizes from 300M to 3B."}

However, current backdoor samples often exhibit two key abnormalities compared to benign samples: 1) Semantic Consistency, where backdoor prompts tend to generate images with similar semantic content even with significant textual variations to the prompts; 2) Attention Consistency, where the trigger induces consistent structural responses in the cross-attention maps. These consistencies leave detectable traces for defenders, making backdoors easier to identify. In this paper, toward stealthy backdoor samples, we propose Trigger without Trace (TwT) by explicitly mitigating these consistencies. Specifically, our approach leverages syntactic structures as backdoor triggers to amplify the sensitivity to textual variations, effectively breaking down the semantic consistency. Besides, a regularization method based on Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KMMD) is proposed to align the distribution of cross-attention responses between backdoor and benign samples, thereby disrupting attention consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 97.5% attack success rate while exhibiting stronger resistance to defenses. It achieves an average of over 98% backdoor samples bypassing three state-of-the-art detection mechanisms, revealing the vulnerabilities of current backdoor defense methods.

To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and optimizers."}

In this paper, we present a predictive model founded on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify patients at HF risk. This model is an ensemble learning approach, a modified stacking technique, that uses two specialized models leveraging clinical and echocardiographic features and then a meta-model to combine the predictions of these two models. We initially assess the model on a real dataset and the obtained results suggest that it performs well in the stratification of patients at HR risk. Specifically, we obtained high sensitivity (95\\%), ensuring that nearly all high-risk patients are identified. As for accuracy, we obtained 84\\%, which can be considered moderate in some ML contexts. However, it is acceptable given our priority of identifying patients at risk of HF because they will be asked to participate in the telemonitoring program of the PrediHealth research project on which some of the authors of this paper are working. The initial findings also suggest that ML-based risk stratification models can serve as valuable decision-support tools not only in the PrediHealth project but also for healthcare professionals, aiding in early intervention and personalized patient management.

Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts."}

A Synthetic Data Investigation", "abstract": "Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work reveals that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These \"class-dependent evaluation effects\" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and evaluation trustworthiness. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches, even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. By showing this disconnect, our work points toward reconsidering what attribution evaluation actually measures and developing more rigorous evaluation methods that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality."}

SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop observed in SOTA methods. This superior performance extends across various types of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0% vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training, supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random networks. Moreover, unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online, adapting to input rather than re-initializing.

We offer an accessible synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI while integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception of understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model forms \"features\" as directions in latent space, learning the connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second, state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world. Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a collection of memorized facts and discovers a \"circuit\" connecting these facts. However, these forms of understanding remain radically different from human understanding, as the phenomenon of \"parallel mechanisms\" shows.

We argue that such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view, one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as (i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have access to."}

However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs."}

However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings. The code is available atthis https URL."}

Most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods."}

To address this, we introduce EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification (HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement, or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations.

Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is memory-bound, with low arithmetic intensity, while feedforward layers are compute-bound. This dichotomy has long motivated research into specialized hardware to mitigate the MHA bottleneck.This paper argues that recent architectural shifts, namely Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), challenge the premise of specialized attention hardware. We make two key observations. First, the arithmetic intensity of MLA is over two orders of magnitude greater than that of MHA, shifting it close to a compute-bound regime well-suited for modern accelerators like GPUs. Second, by distributing MoE experts across a pool of accelerators, their arithmetic intensity can be tuned through batching to match that of the dense layers, creating a more balanced computational profile.These findings reveal a diminishing need for specialized attention hardware. The central challenge for next-generation Transformers is no longer accelerating a single memory-bound layer. Instead, the focus must shift to designing balanced systems with sufficient compute, memory capacity, memory bandwidth, and high-bandwidth interconnects to manage the diverse demands of large-scale models."}

Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR.

These measurements are fused within an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework, selected for its ability to handle nonlinear relative dynamics, to estimate the full relative pose. Key contributions include the integrated system architecture and a dual adaptive strategy within the UKF: dynamic tuning of the measurement noise covariance compensates for varying CNN measurement uncertainty, while adaptive tuning of the process noise covariance, utilizing measurement residual analysis, accounts for unmodeled dynamics or maneuvers online.

For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65% compared to the baseline."}

Additionally, static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks, significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards. Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability."}

Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and 52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human recall 100%)."}

However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors, overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.

Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of performance.

It then redistributes the answer slot according to the inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer, thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues.

In this paper, we propose Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across diverse datasets and adversarial settings."}

Existing studies primarily highlight that LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information, shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore, we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications."}

To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred. We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop, Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance, when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\\% of the original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by 4.01%."}

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance."}

The defining characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector against LRMs, which we term \"overthinking backdoors\". We advance this concept by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning process, without degrading the final answer's correctness.

We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances."}

TDR decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO, the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models by 11% on the average.

To address this gap, we present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks.

We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing, corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness.

Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming sparsity/undersampling issues.

Existing approaches typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations, while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic, and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover, customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3 while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source code, models, and scripts are available atthis https URL."}

In this paper, we introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the prompt model.

Despite these distortions, we uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models.

In this work, we introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular, task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging. For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name. These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent\" runs the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments."}

This paper outlines the challenges' design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1) Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation, suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques. Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even systems with over 50\\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\\%). 5) Despite recent progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive system ensembles."}

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings). We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the \"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers."}

While IR methods have seen several paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR. LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both challenges simultaneously.

Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via image-to-text retrieval.

Trump is significantly more distinctive than his fellow Republicans, whose uniqueness values appear closer to those of the Democrats. Contributing to these differences is Trump's employment of divisive and antagonistic language, particularly when targeting his political opponents. These differences hold across a variety of measurement strategies, arise on both the campaign trail and in official presidential addresses, and do not appear to be an artifact of secular changes in presidential communications."}

However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.

But such systems have a history of incorrectly flagging content by and about marginalized identities for removal. Generative AI systems now use such filters to keep undesired generated content from being created by or shown to users. While a lot of focus has been given to making sure such systems do not produce undesired outcomes, considerably less attention has been paid to making sure appropriate text can be generated. From classrooms to Hollywood, as generative AI is increasingly used for creative or expressive text generation, whose stories will these technologies allow to be told, and whose will they suppress?In this paper, we define and introduce measures of speech suppression, focusing on speech related to different identity groups incorrectly filtered by a range of content moderation APIs. Using both short-form, user-generated datasets traditional in content moderation and longer generative AI-focused data, including two datasets we introduce in this work, we create a benchmark for measurement of speech suppression for nine identity groups. Across one traditional and four generative AI-focused automated content moderation services tested, we find that identity-related speech is more likely to be incorrectly suppressed than other speech. We find that reasons for incorrect flagging behavior vary by identity based on stereotypes and text associations, with, e.g., disability-related content more likely to be flagged for self-harm or health-related reasons while non-Christian content is more likely to be flagged as violent or hateful. As generative AI systems are increasingly used for creative work, we urge further attention to how this may impact the creation of identity-related content."}

To address its limitations, the existing common strategy is to follow SFT with a separate phase of preference optimization (PO), which relies on either human-labeled preference data or a strong reward model to guide the learning process. In this paper, we address the limitations of SFT by exploring one of the most successful techniques in conventional supervised learning: discriminative learning. We introduce Discriminative Fine-Tuning (DFT), an improved variant of SFT, which mitigates the burden of collecting human-labeled preference data or training strong reward models. Unlike SFT that employs a generative approach and overlooks negative data, DFT adopts a discriminative paradigm that increases the probability of positive answers while suppressing potentially negative ones, aiming for data prediction instead of token prediction. Our contributions include: (i) a discriminative probabilistic framework for fine-tuning LLMs by explicitly modeling the discriminative likelihood of an answer among all possible outputs given an input; (ii) efficient algorithms to optimize this discriminative likelihood; and (iii) extensive experiments demonstrating DFT's effectiveness, achieving performance better than SFT and comparable to if not better than SFT$\\rightarrow$PO.

This work investigates the learning dynamics of language models on a synthetic factual recall task, uncovering three key findings: First, language models learn in three phases, exhibiting a performance plateau before acquiring precise factual knowledge. Mechanistically, this plateau coincides with the formation of attention-based circuits that support recall. Second, the training data distribution significantly impacts learning dynamics, as imbalanced distributions lead to shorter plateaus. Finally, hallucinations emerge simultaneously with knowledge, and integrating new knowledge into the model through fine-tuning is challenging, as it quickly corrupts its existing parametric memories.

Blythe,Casimir Fisch", "title": "Exploiting individual differences to bootstrap communication", "abstract": "Establishing a communication system is hard because the intended meaning of a signal is unknown to its receiver when first produced, and the signaller also has no idea how that signal will be interpreted. Most theoretical accounts of the emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours that have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such feedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was intended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how communication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we present a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an unbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural differences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine communicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this outcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of psychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared intentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of communication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible socially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a general but well-developed capacity for social cognition."}

In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation.

We argue that LLMs develop internal structures that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception of understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model forms \"features\" as directions in latent space, learning the connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second, state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world. Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a collection of memorized facts and discovers a \"circuit\" connecting these facts. However, these forms of understanding remain radically different from human understanding, as the phenomenon of \"parallel mechanisms\" shows.

For this task, particularly in less-resourced languages, it remains unclear whether fine-tuned methods or in-context learning (ICL) yield better results. In this paper, we compile CLIC, a novel dataset for clickbait detection of Croatian news headlines spanning a 20-year period and encompassing mainstream and fringe outlets. We fine-tune the BERTić model on this task and compare its performance to LLM-based ICL methods with prompts both in Croatian and English. Finally, we analyze the linguistic properties of clickbait. We find that nearly half of the analyzed headlines contain clickbait, and that finetuned models deliver better results than general LLMs."}

However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge: predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources, thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws.

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment, robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM agents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use modern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first propose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR models for MDD. Next, we define a more general alignment-free method that takes all possible alignments of the target phoneme into account (GOP-AF). We give a theoretical account of our definition of GOP-AF, an implementation that solves potential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which makes the method applicable with acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We provide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and Speechocean762 datasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the dependency of GOP-AF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount of context around the target phoneme.

While effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors, effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead.

There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN (Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained, achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent.

The system processes video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392). Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded datasets or specialised small-object detectors.

In this work, we investigated how size and separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on imaging manufacturer) or non-separable \"pseudo-subgroups\". We found that simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance, with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels.

While observational studies suggest links between these conditions and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823 dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a 188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI = 1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function monitoring into cancer prevention strategies."}

To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models.

However, their application to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models' understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns. This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods in tasks involving scientific field data.

These ice clouds can alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence. Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras, could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will facilitate better calibration of physical models.

The absence of constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task. Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF) based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting.

HumanMaterial first obtain the initial material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map has different significance for rendering results.

Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level reconstruction or negative samples.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1. Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations. Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an object from facial landmarks.

To address this, we propose a device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception."}

By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard accuracy across diverse tasks.

To dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the causal generation process.

Noticing that the coarse scales contain sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering, enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales, resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating multi-scale generation history.

However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC. Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art results in several scenarios.

Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.

To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets. However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC, a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy Score\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques."}

We present the first systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features. Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate) the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust, representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological information over technical artifacts."}

Because soil N has high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm, and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in vineyards."}

Despite recent advances, these existing methods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or alter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about watermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of fine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a result, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice, which limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS) systems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a Service (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in which we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark can still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose ShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical deployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in the protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark decoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining the so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN architectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating the fidelity-robustness trade-off.

To address these limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision. Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514 with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities."}

Leveraging tensor network modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830 T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable parameters of the original model.

However, the noisy nature of such pseudo-labels presents a major bottleneck in adapting a network to the distribution shift between source and target datasets. This challenge is exaggerated when the network encounters an incoming data stream in online fashion, where the network is constrained to adapt to incoming streams of target domain data in exactly one round of forward and backward passes. In this scenario, relying solely on inaccurate pseudo-labels can lead to low-quality segmentation, which is detrimental to medical image analysis where accuracy and precision are of utmost priority. We hypothesize that a small amount of pixel-level annotation obtained from an expert can address this problem, thereby enhancing the performance of domain adaptation of online streaming data, even in the absence of dedicated training data. We call our method ODES: Domain Adaptation with Expert Guidance for Online Medical Image Segmentation that adapts to each incoming data batch in an online setup, incorporating feedback from an expert through active learning.

To mitigate this, we employ pre-trained monocular depth estimation and visual correspondence models to achieve coarse alignments of 3D Gaussians. We then introduce lightweight, learnable modules to refine depth and pose estimates from the coarse alignments, improving the quality of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Furthermore, the refined estimates are leveraged to estimate geometry confidence scores, which assess the reliability of 3D Gaussian centers and condition the prediction of Gaussian parameters accordingly. Extensive evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that PF3plat sets a new state-of-the-art across all benchmarks, supported by comprehensive ablation studies validating our design choices. project page:this https URL"}

It reveals that mappings from individual biological profile to different medical modalities remain static across the population, which is implied in the personalization process. We propose a two-stage approach: pre-training with invariant representation $\\mathbb{X}_h$ for personalization, then fine-tuning for diverse downstream tasks. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of personalization, showing that our approach yields greater generalizability and transferability across diverse multi-modal medical tasks compared to methods lacking personalization.

While such methods deliver the current state of the art, they often fail to correctly separate instances overlapping in 2D image space since only semantics are considered. To tackle this issue, we instead propose to cut the semantic masks in 3D to obtain the final 2D instances by utilizing a point cloud representation of the scene. Furthermore, we derive a Spatial Importance function, which we use to resharpen the semantics along the 3D borders of instances. Nevertheless, these pseudo-masks are still subject to mask ambiguity. To address this issue, we further propose to augment the training of a class-agnostic detector with three Spatial Confidence components aiming to isolate a clean learning signal. With these contributions, our approach outperforms competing methods across multiple standard benchmarks for unsupervised instance segmentation and object detection."}

Prevailing high-resolution depth estimation methods adopt a patch-based approach, which introduces depth discontinuity issues when reassembling the estimated depth patches, resulting in test-time inefficiency.

To tackle these limitations, we propose Patch Refine Once (PRO), an efficient and generalizable tile-based framework. Our PRO consists of two key components: (i) Grouped Patch Consistency Training that enhances test-time efficiency while mitigating the depth discontinuity problem by jointly processing four overlapping patches and enforcing a consistency loss on their overlapping regions within a single backpropagation step, and (ii) Bias Free Masking that prevents the DE models from overfitting to dataset-specific biases, enabling better generalization to real-world datasets even after training on synthetic data.

To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network (RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner.

SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop observed in SOTA methods. This superior performance extends across various types of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0% vs. 29.5%).

This task is extremely challenging due to the difficulty in generalizing from known to unknown actions. Previous studies typically use two-stage training: pre-training skeleton encoders on seen action categories using cross-entropy loss and then aligning pre-extracted skeleton and text features, enabling knowledge transfer to unseen classes through skeleton-text alignment and language models' generalization. However, their efficacy is hindered by 1) insufficient discrimination for skeleton features, as the fixed skeleton encoder fails to capture necessary alignment information for effective skeleton-text alignment; 2) the neglect of alignment bias between skeleton and unseen text features during testing. To this end, we propose a prototype-guided feature alignment paradigm for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, termed PGFA. Specifically, we develop an end-to-end cross-modal contrastive training framework to improve skeleton-text alignment, ensuring sufficient discrimination for skeleton features. Additionally, we introduce a prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy to mitigate the adverse impact of the distribution discrepancy during testing.

However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation.

Although recent face image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those of high-quality (HQ) counterparts.

To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm.

However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO.

The multi-scale low-rank regularization for HSI denoising utilizes the global and local spectral correlation as well as the spatial nonlocal self-similarity priors of HSIs.

Additionally, we demonstrated continual enhancement of an existing AI model by incorporating approximately 40,000 additional medical images (named AREDS2 dataset). The improved model was then systematically evaluated using both AREDS and AREDS2 test sets, as well as an external test set from Singapore. AI assistance markedly enhanced diagnostic accuracy and classification for 23 out of 24 clinicians, with the average F1-score increasing by 20% from 37.71 (Manual) to 45.52 (Manual + AI) (P-value < 0.0001), achieving an improvement of over 50% in some cases. In terms of efficiency, AI assistance reduced diagnostic times for 17 out of the 19 clinicians tracked, with time savings of up to 40%. Furthermore, a model equipped with continual learning showed robust performance across three independent datasets, recording a 29% increase in accuracy, and elevating the F1-score from 42 to 54 in the Singapore population."}

It is natural to extend this technique to video diffusion, which generates video conditioned on a variable number of context frames, collectively referred to as history. However, we find two key challenges to guiding with variable-length history: architectures that only support fixed-size conditioning, and the empirical observation that CFG-style history dropout performs poorly. To address this, we propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), a video diffusion architecture and theoretically grounded training objective that jointly enable conditioning on a flexible number of history frames. We then introduce History Guidance, a family of guidance methods uniquely enabled by DFoT. We show that its simplest form, vanilla history guidance, already significantly improves video generation quality and temporal consistency. A more advanced method, history guidance across time and frequency further enhances motion dynamics, enables compositional generalization to out-of-distribution history, and can stably roll out extremely long videos.

We hypothesize that combining an unconditional diffusion model with data consistency, trained on a diverse dataset, can reduce these hallucinations. Based on this, we propose DynamicDPS, a diffusion-based framework that integrates conditional and unconditional diffusion models to enhance low-quality medical images while systematically reducing hallucinations. Our approach first generates an initial reconstruction using a conditional model, then refines it with an adaptive diffusion-based inverse problem solver. DynamicDPS skips early stage in the reverse process by selecting an optimal starting time point per sample and applies Wolfe's line search for adaptive step sizes, improving both efficiency and image fidelity. Using diffusion priors and data consistency, our method effectively reduces hallucinations from any conditional model output. We validate its effectiveness in Image Quality Transfer for low-field MRI enhancement. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real MR scans, including a downstream task for tissue volume estimation, show that DynamicDPS reduces hallucinations, improving relative volume estimation by over 15% for critical tissues while using only 5% of the sampling steps required by baseline diffusion models. As a model-agnostic and fine-tuning-free approach, DynamicDPS offers a robust solution for hallucination reduction in medical imaging. The code will be made publicly available upon publication."}

However, operator dependency and technical limitations (e.g. intrinsic artefacts and effects, setting errors) can complicate image interpretation and the assessment of diagnostic uncertainty. We present L-FUSION (Laplacian Fetal US Segmentation with Integrated FoundatiON models), a framework that integrates uncertainty quantification through unsupervised, normative learning and large-scale foundation models for robust segmentation of fetal structures in normal and pathological scans. We propose to utilise the aleatoric logit distributions of Stochastic Segmentation Networks and Laplace approximations with fast Hessian estimations to estimate epistemic uncertainty only from the segmentation head. This enables us to achieve reliable abnormality quantification for instant diagnostic feedback. Combined with an integrated Dropout component, L-FUSION enables reliable differentiation of lesions from normal fetal anatomy with enhanced uncertainty maps and segmentation counterfactuals in US imaging. It improves epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty interpretation and removes the need for manual disease-labelling. Evaluations across multiple datasets show that L-FUSION achieves superior segmentation accuracy and consistent uncertainty quantification, supporting on-site decision-making and offering a scalable solution for advancing fetal ultrasound analysis in clinical settings."}

For these objects, it is paramount to grasp gently -- not using the maximum amount of force possible, but rather the minimum amount of force necessary. This paper proposes using visual, tactile, and auditory signals to learn to grasp and regrasp objects stably and gently. Specifically, we use audio signals as an indicator of gentleness during the grasping, and then train an end-to-end action-conditional model from raw visuo-tactile inputs that predicts both the stability and the gentleness of future grasping candidates, thus allowing the selection and execution of the most promising action. Experimental results on a multi-fingered hand over 1,500 grasping trials demonstrated that our model is useful for gentle grasping by validating the predictive performance (3.27% higher accuracy than the vision-only variant) and providing interpretations of their behavior. Finally, real-world experiments confirmed that the grasping performance with the trained multi-modal model outperformed other baselines (17% higher rate for stable and gentle grasps than vision-only). Our approach requires neither tactile sensor calibration nor analytical force modeling, drastically reducing the engineering effort to grasp fragile objects.

In contrast, learned bidirectional video compression (BVC) remains underexplored and still lags behind its forward-only counterparts. This performance gap is mainly due to the limited ability to extract diverse and accurate contexts: most existing BVCs primarily exploit temporal motion while neglecting non-local correlations across frames. Moreover, they lack the adaptability to dynamically suppress harmful contexts arising from fast motion or occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we propose BiECVC, a BVC framework that incorporates diversified local and non-local context modeling along with adaptive context gating. For local context enhancement, BiECVC reuses high-quality features from lower layers and aligns them using decoded motion vectors without introducing extra motion overhead. To model non-local dependencies efficiently, we adopt a linear attention mechanism that balances performance and complexity. To further mitigate the impact of inaccurate context prediction, we introduce Bidirectional Context Gating, inspired by data-dependent decay in recent autoregressive language models, to dynamically filter contextual information based on conditional coding results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiECVC achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the bit-rate by 13.4% and 15.7% compared to VTM 13.2 under the Random Access (RA) configuration with intra periods of 32 and 64, respectively.

However, rapid land surface changes often render static samples obsolete within months, making manual sample updates labor-intensive and unsustainable. To address this challenge, we propose TasGen, a two-stage Temporal spectral-aware Automatic Sample Generation method for generating dynamic training samples from single-date static labels without human intervention. Land surface dynamics often manifest as anomalies in temporal-spectral sequences. %These anomalies are multivariate yet unified: temporal, spectral, or joint anomalies stem from different mechanisms and cannot be naively coupled, as this may obscure the nature of changes. Yet, any land surface state corresponds to a coherent temporal-spectral signature, which would be lost if the two dimensions are modeled separately. To effectively capture these dynamics, TasGen first disentangles temporal and spectral features to isolate their individual contributions, and then couples them to model their synergistic interactions. In the first stage, we introduce a hierarchical temporal-spectral variational autoencoder (HTS-VAE) with a dual-dimension embedding to learn low-dimensional latent patterns of normal samples by first disentangling and then jointly embedding temporal and spectral information. This temporal-spectral embedding enables robust anomaly detection by identifying deviations from learned joint patterns. In the second stage, a classifier trained on stable samples relabels change points across time to generate dynamic samples. To not only detect but also explain surface dynamics, we further propose an anomaly interpretation method based on Gibbs sampling, which attributes changes to specific spectral-temporal dimensions."}

The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance. The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking."}

To address this, we introduce EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification (HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement, or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations.

Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization.

To address this challenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during model training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to diversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we hypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to suboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with frequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we propose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut) which masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed around crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level contextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our extensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that masking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and significantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual navigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward crop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and generalizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction in prediction error. In addition, we conduct ablation studies to determine the number of masks, the size of each mask, and the spatial distribution of masks to maximize overall performance."}

To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets. However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC, a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy Score\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques."}

These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models, including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline key challenges and research directions to advance the field."}

This sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias. Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt -- and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of 81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of 87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off relative to our original early-stopping method."}

LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination.

GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact of structural changes on GNN predictions.

We introduce C-AAE, a compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder (AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %, easing transmission and storage overheads.

To address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively \"squeezing\" 16-bit LLMs' weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2 show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.

In such contexts, it is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\\it additional supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting naturally raises fundamental questions: {\\it What kinds of additional supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\\it how do they contribute to improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label, but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner."}

A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized. The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term (RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the one-step-ahead prediction accuracy.

In this work, we analyze a critical yet overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating process.

Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data."}

In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory. Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents. Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core assumptions of Dec-POMDPs.

Our approach first applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 \"uncalibrated\" catchment-based conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from 87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55) but required only 5% of its computational time.

However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."}

In this work, we show that, when executed back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition.

Rahmani,Emine Yilmaz,David Barber", "title": "Beyond Internal Data: Constructing Complete Datasets for Fairness Testing", "abstract": "As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge. Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data. Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features. We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data, and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work, therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited."}

The approach utilizes tabular Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static, domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and adaptability.

These applications have diverse token-generation latency requirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive (LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive category and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling opportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO requirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch generate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct SLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for handling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates fine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE scenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO attainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot tolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO scheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing throughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their per-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the server fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still SLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling. To increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share tighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses profiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through request-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked prefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing policies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput."}

Technical limitations have restricted prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources.

However, their susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features. Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate) the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust, representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological information over technical artifacts."}

Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age, and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge, this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images. Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI systems."}

Because soil N has high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm, and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in vineyards."}

This study presents the first application of supervised machine learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models - including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset coverage.

We then propose a general scheme for reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism group of code to further improve the code performance.

Aside from sensitivity to cut-off, each of these OPs introduces its own systematic biases. In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is presented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using atomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a high-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like, and symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to expose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently, unsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous atoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with multidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a minimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various tests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only three order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels. Based on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as the logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal throughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance (AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient on-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal C-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the hypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains relevance later. This workflow provides a data-driven strategy for OP selection and a metric to monitor structural transformations in large-scale polymer simulations."}

Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches.

These agents handle both structured and unstructured data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging. For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name. These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on data type and model requirements.

Despite recent advances using deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision, implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will facilitate further research in this domain."}

These ice clouds can alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence. Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras, could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments."}

To overcome the lack of such a dataset, recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations.

Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular behavioral pattern.

This trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs) have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However, the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO, the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel 'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way, simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps)."}

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1. Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations. Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data.

While existing DT research primarily centers on asset transfer, the significance of \"sim-to-real transfer\" and \"real-to-sim transfer\"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key challenge in this process is calibrating the \"reality gap,\" the discrepancy between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the historical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian bridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different levels of integration of our approach with an existing framework.

DriftMoE features a compact neural router that is co-trained alongside a pool of incremental Hoeffding tree experts. The key innovation lies in a symbiotic learning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most suitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with the true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot correctness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop provides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert specialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art data stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts testing two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data regimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class specialization (task-based variant).

The annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable LLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated analysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate its effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of topological neighborhoods."}

However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC. Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC."}

Instead of relying on text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic images.

Some attempts have been made to directly apply parts of the Adam algorithm to manifolds or to find an underlying structure, but a full generalization has remained elusive.In this work a new approach is presented that leverages the special structure of the manifolds which are relevant for optimization of neural networks, such as the Stiefel manifold, the symplectic Stiefel manifold and the Grassmann manifold: all of these are homogeneous spaces and as such admit a global tangent space representation - a common vector space (Lie subspace) in which all tangent spaces can easily be represented.This global tangent space representation is used to perform all of the steps in the Adam optimizer and we are able to fully generalize the optimizer to manifolds without a projection step.

We analyze the Hessian during gradient descent, identify a dynamical transition in its spectral properties, and relate it to the ability of escaping rough regions in the loss landscape. When the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large enough, an informative negative direction exists in the Hessian at the beginning of the descent, i.e in the initial condition. While descending, a BBP transition in the spectrum takes place in finite time: the direction is lost, and the dynamics is trapped in a rugged region filled with marginally stable bad minima. Surprisingly, for finite system sizes, this window of negative curvature allows the system to recover the signal well before the theoretical SNR found for infinite sizes, emphasizing the central role of initialization and early-time dynamics for efficiently navigating rough landscapes."}

Through extensive analyses-including dimensionality reduction and comparison studies-PDeepPP demonstrates strong, interpretable peptide representations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in 25 of the 33 biological identification tasks. Notably, PDeepPP attains high accuracy in antimicrobial (0.9726) and phosphorylation site (0.9984) identification, with 99.5% specificity in glycosylation site prediction and substantial reduction in false negatives in antimalarial tasks. By enabling large-scale, accurate peptide analysis, PDeepPP supports biomedical research and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for disease treatment.

First, we use Large Language Models (LLMs) to show their ability to understand these terms. Second, Google Perspective API suggests that Islamophobic posts tend to receive higher toxicity scores than other categories of hate speech like Antisemitism. Finally, we use BERT topic modeling approach to extract different topics and Islamophobic discourse on these social platforms. Our findings indicate that LLMs understand these Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) slurs; however, further improvements in moderation strategies and algorithmic detection are necessary to address such discourse effectively. Our topic modeling also indicates that Islamophobic text is found across various political, conspiratorial, and far-right movements and is particularly directed against Muslim immigrants.

Despite this empirical success, the theoretical foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization. Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability."}

However, recent work reveals that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These \"class-dependent evaluation effects\" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and evaluation trustworthiness. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches, even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. By showing this disconnect, our work points toward reconsidering what attribution evaluation actually measures and developing more rigorous evaluation methods that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality."}

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) addresses this by optimizing models toward human preferences using a learned reward function and reinforcement learning, yielding improved alignment but suffering from high computational cost and instability. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplifies the process by treating alignment as a classification task over binary preference pairs, reducing training overhead while achieving competitive performance. However, it assumes fixed, single-dimensional preferences and only supports pairwise supervision.To address these limitations, we propose Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, which allows the model to learn from more detailed human feedback and flexibly balance multiple goals such as helpfulness, honesty, and fluency. Our method models full-ranked preference distributions rather than binary comparisons, enabling more informative learning signals. The lambda vector controls the relative importance of different alignment goals, allowing the model to generalize across diverse human objectives. During inference, lambda can be adjusted without retraining, providing controllable alignment behavior for downstream use. We also introduce a learned scheduler that dynamically samples performant lambda configurations to improve robustness.Notably, our method requires only 20GB of GPU memory for training, making it suitable for compute-constrained settings such as academic labs, educational tools, or on-device assistants.

To remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view, one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as (i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the defined Task Priors?

These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios.

It is known (Grohe and Ritzert, LICS 2017) that classifiers definable in first-order logic over structures of polylogarithmic degree can be learned in sublinear time, where the degree of the structure and the running time are measured in terms of the size of the structure. We generalise the results to the first-order logic with counting FOCN, which was introduced by Kuske and Schweikardt (LICS 2017) as an expressive logic generalising various other counting logics. Specifically, we prove that classifiers definable in FOCN over classes of structures of polylogarithmic degree can be consistently learned in sublinear time. This can be seen as a first step towards extending the learning framework to include numerical aspects of machine learning. We extend the result to agnostic probably approximately correct (PAC) learning for classes of structures of degree at most $(\\log \\log n)^c$ for some constant $c$. Moreover, we show that bounding the degree is crucial to obtain sublinear-time learning algorithms.

Recognizing their importance, the field of explainable AI (XAI) provides several techniques to generate these explanations. Yet, there is relatively little emphasis on the user (the explainee) in this growing body of work and most XAI techniques generate \"one-size-fits-all\" explanations. To bridge this gap and achieve a step closer towards human-centered XAI, we present I-CEE, a framework that provides Image Classification Explanations tailored to User Expertise. Informed by existing work, I-CEE explains the decisions of image classification models by providing the user with an informative subset of training data (i.e., example images), corresponding local explanations, and model decisions. However, unlike prior work, I-CEE models the informativeness of the example images to depend on user expertise, resulting in different examples for different users. We posit that by tailoring the example set to user expertise, I-CEE can better facilitate users' understanding and simulatability of the model. To evaluate our approach, we conduct detailed experiments in both simulation and with human participants (N = 100) on multiple datasets. Experiments with simulated users show that I-CEE improves users' ability to accurately predict the model's decisions (simulatability) compared to baselines, providing promising preliminary results.

The buyer aims to maximize their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to per-round return-on-investment (RoI) constraints in a strategic (or adversarial) environment. Using an $m$-uniform bidding format, the buyer submits $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid $b_i$, with $m \\ll M$ in practice, where $M$ denotes the maximum demand of the buyer.We introduce the notion of safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy the RoI constraints irrespective of competing bids. Despite the stringent requirement, we show that these strategies satisfy a mild no-overbidding condition, depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can focus on a finite subset without loss of generality. Though the subset size is $O(M^m)$, we design a polynomial-time learning algorithm that achieves sublinear regret, both in full-information and bandit settings, relative to the hindsight-optimal safe strategy.We assess the robustness of safe strategies against the hindsight-optimal strategy from a richer class. We define the richness ratio $\\alpha \\in (0,1]$ as the minimum ratio of the value of the optimal safe strategy to that of the optimal strategy from richer class and construct hard instances showing the tightness of $\\alpha$.

Assuming that the number of defective samples is very small compared to $p$, GT algorithms have provided excellent recovery of the status of all $p$ samples with even a small number of groups. Most existing methods, however, assume that the group memberships are accurately specified. This assumption may not always be true in all applications, due to various resource constraints. Such errors could occur, eg, when a technician, preparing the groups in a laboratory, unknowingly mixes together an incorrect subset of samples as compared to what was specified. We develop a new GT method, the Debiased Robust Lasso Test Method (DRLT), that handles such group membership specification errors. The proposed DRLT method is based on an approach to debias, or reduce the inherent bias in, estimates produced by Lasso, a popular and effective sparse regression technique. We also provide theoretical upper bounds on the reconstruction error produced by our estimator. Our approach is then combined with two carefully designed hypothesis tests respectively for (i) the identification of defective samples in the presence of errors in group membership specifications, and (ii) the identification of groups with erroneous membership specifications. The DRLT approach extends the literature on bias mitigation of statistical estimators such as the LASSO, to handle the important case when some of the measurements contain outliers, due to factors such as group membership specification errors. We present numerical results which show that our approach outperforms several baselines and robust regression techniques for identification of defective samples as well as erroneously specified groups."}

To address this issue, we propose a novel robust MVL method (namely RML) with simultaneous representation fusion and alignment. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective multi-view transformer fusion network where we transform heterogeneous multi-view data into homogeneous word embeddings, and then integrate multiple views by the sample-level attention mechanism to obtain a fused representation. Furthermore, we propose a simulated perturbation based multi-view contrastive learning framework that dynamically generates the noise and unusable perturbations for simulating imperfect data conditions. The simulated noisy and unusable data obtain two distinct fused representations, and we utilize contrastive learning to align them for learning discriminative and robust representations. Our RML is self-supervised and can also be applied for downstream tasks as a regularization. In experiments, we employ it in multi-view unsupervised clustering, noise-label classification, and as a plug-and-play module for cross-modal hashing retrieval.

Finally, hallucinations emerge simultaneously with knowledge, and integrating new knowledge into the model through fine-tuning is challenging, as it quickly corrupts its existing parametric memories. Our results emphasize the importance of data distribution in knowledge acquisition and suggest novel data scheduling strategies to accelerate neural network training."}

For example, in cloud-based services, streaming content faster than users can read appears unnecessary, resulting in wasted computational resources and potential delays for other users, particularly during peak usage periods. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive streaming method that dynamically adjusts the pacing of LLM streaming output in real-time based on inferred cognitive load. Our approach estimates the cognitive load associated with streaming content and strategically slows down the stream during complex or information-rich segments, thereby freeing computational resources for other users. We conducted a statistical analysis and simulation based on a statistical model derived from data collected in a crowdsourced user study across various types of LLM-generated content.

SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop observed in SOTA methods. This superior performance extends across various types of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0% vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training, supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random networks. Moreover, unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online, adapting to input rather than re-initializing.

In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB.

In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb) on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers, with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities, particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools."}

To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM) extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module (FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM) enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information. Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the high-level vision task."}

However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline.

Yet, how software engineers engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design, inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three industry settings across Turkiye and Azerbaijan, our work illustrates how engineers navigate AI use with human oversight. These models offer structured, lightweight guidance to support more deliberate and effective use of AI tools in SE, contributing to ongoing discussions on practical human-AI collaboration."}

Suleiman,Yiming Tang,Daqing Hou", "title": "Factors Impacting Faculty Adoption of Project-Based Learning in Computing Education: a Survey", "abstract": "This research full paper investigates the factors influencing computing educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering and computing curricula. Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach, PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits, faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities, designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs, along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued, its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to experiment with and scale PjBL practices."}

Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity, heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++ repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed.

As these systems proliferate, understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities. While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research.To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859 real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying 109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from public vulnerability databases.Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks. Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled systems."}

Therefore, many techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However, they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and generating false positive bug reports.To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop, multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or suspension.We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and 1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer, Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively.

While effective, language models tend to generate many incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a \"missed opportunity\" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code. YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20% more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs)."}

To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation environments.This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus, extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available, certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier."}

Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software.

We conducted an online survey of 108 software practitioners, followed by ordinal logistic regression to analyze the relationship between fairness perceptions and job satisfaction in software engineering contexts, with moderation analysis examining how this relationship varies across demographic groups.

The relationship between fairness and job satisfaction is stronger for female, ethnically underrepresented, less experienced practitioners, and those with work limitations. Fairness in authorship emerged as an important factor for job satisfaction collectively, while fairness in policy implementation, high-demand situations, and working hours impacted specific demographic groups. This study highlights the role of fairness among software practitioners, offering strategies for organizations to promote fair practices and targeted approaches for certain demographic groups."}

Specifically, the paper examines how the BPpy framework, a Python-based implementation of BP, is enhanced by and enhances various FM and AI tools. We assess how integrating BP with tools such as Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers, symbolic and probabilistic model checking, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) allow us to scale the abilities of BP to model complex systems. Additionally, we illustrate how developers can leverage multiple tools within a single modeling and development task. The paper provides quantitative and qualitative evidence supporting the feasibility of our vision to create a comprehensive toolbox for harnessing AI and FM methods in a unified development framework."}

This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education."}

Existing Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools struggle to effectively detect vulnerable API usage from these libraries due to limitations in understanding API usage semantics and computational challenges in analyzing complex codebases, leading to inaccurate vulnerability alerts that burden development teams and delay critical security fixes.To address these challenges, we proposed SAVANT by leveraging two insights: proof-of-vulnerability test cases demonstrate how vulnerabilities can be triggered in specific contexts, and Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand code semantics. SAVANT combines semantic preprocessing with LLM-powered context analysis for accurate vulnerability detection. SAVANT first segments source code into meaningful blocks while preserving semantic relationships, then leverages LLM-based reflection to analyze API usage context and determine actual vulnerability impacts. Our evaluation on 55 real-world applications shows that SAVANT achieves 83.8% precision, 73.8% recall, 69.0% accuracy, and 78.5% F1-score, outperforming state-of-the-art SCA tools."}

OpenCAMS is designed to support advanced research in transportation safety, mobility, and cybersecurity by combining the strengths of each simulation domain. Specifically, SUMO provides large-scale, microscopic traffic modeling; CARLA offers high-fidelity 3D perception, vehicle dynamics, and control simulation; and OMNeT++ enables modular, event-driven network communication, such as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X). OpenCAMS employs a time-synchronized, bidirectional coupling architecture that ensures coherent simulation progression across traffic, perception, and communication domains while preserving modularity and reproducibility. For example, CARLA can simulate and render a subset of vehicles that require detailed sensor emulation and control logic; SUMO orchestrates network-wide traffic flow, vehicle routing, and traffic signal management; and OMNeT++ dynamically maps communication nodes to both mobile entities (e.g., vehicles) and static entities (e.g., roadside units) to enable C-V2X communication. While these three simulators form the foundational core of OpenCAMS, the platform is designed to be expandable and future-proof, allowing additional simulators to be integrated on top of this core without requiring fundamental changes to the system architecture. The OpenCAMS platform is fully open-source and publicly available through its GitHub repositorythis https URL, providing the research community with an accessible, flexible, and collaborative environment for advancing next-generation intelligent transportation systems."}

These modules are coordinated by a central orchestration engine that learns coordination policies based on circuit structure, hardware constraints, and backend-aware performance features such as gate count, depth, and expected fidelity. The system outputs an optimized circuit for hardware-aware transpilation and execution, leveraging techniques from an existing state-of-the-art approach, called the NISQ Analyzer, to adapt to backend constraints."}

This manual triage process becomes increasingly burdensome as applications evolve, creating a need for automated analysis solutions. This paper introduces LLMShot, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically analyze snapshot test failures through semantic classification of UI changes. To evaluate LLMShot's effectiveness, we developed a comprehensive dataset using a feature-rich iOS application with configurable feature flags, creating realistic scenarios that produce authentic snapshot differences representative of real development workflows. Our evaluation using Gemma3 models demonstrates strong classification performance, with the 12B variant achieving over 84% recall in identifying failure root causes while the 4B model offers practical deployment advantages with acceptable performance for continuous integration environments. However, our exploration of selective ignore mechanisms revealed significant limitations in current prompting-based approaches for controllable visual reasoning. LLMShot represents the first automated approach to semantic snapshot test analysis, offering developers structured insights that can substantially reduce manual triage effort and advance toward more intelligent UI testing paradigms."}

Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise downstream. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel approach named RAGSum with the aim of both effectiveness and efficiency in recommendations. RAGSum is built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three well-established baselines. The results show that our approach substantially outperforms thebaselines with respect to BLEU, METEOR, and ROUTE-L. These findings indicate that tightly coupling retrieval and generationcan raise the ceiling for comment automation and motivateforthcoming replications and qualitative developer studies."}

Analyzing LLM and Agent Patches on SWE-bench", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb) on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers, with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities, particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools."}
