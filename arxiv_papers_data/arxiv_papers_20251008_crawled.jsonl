This paper presents a comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while maintaining compliance in evolving domains."}

Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory, and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability. The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer basis for traceability and evaluation.We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning, email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation. All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements. Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines. Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings."}

Despite this promise, existing approaches typically remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average modeling accuracy by 7.8\\%, with gains of up to 21.9\\% on the ComplexLP dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation from problem intent to solver-executable code."}

This limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes. DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages: qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements ([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules. Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems."}

We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the Gödelian (self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible \"worlds\" (data strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second, we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the \"grounding act\" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own. This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations."}

This design transforms informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5 orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\\%, and reduces time overhead by up to 74\\%."}

This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation, interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data, including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks, Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic, Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in particular."}

How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the generated scripts."}

For instance, repeated sampling has been shown to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget? This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a fraction of the computational cost."}

Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward to stabilize training and improve performance.

A major challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account.

Recent works have proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially, MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high performance across different foundation models and task domains without further optimization."}

Top-down approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales. However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their associated uncertainty.We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport \"footprints\", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole fractions.While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates."}

FETA decomposes a multivariate series into channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences; a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions.

We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent, auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for high-stakes domains."}

However, as the landscape of reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary reasoning models."}

In this work, we investigate why safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as \\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\\% of these heads can reduce attack success rates below 10\\%. Building on these mechanistic insights, we propose \\textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment.

However, applying extended reasoning to every step introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation, rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end, we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without compromising accuracy."}

To address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes. It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.

We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with 22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a 16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors.

In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles), verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This property, referred to as \\emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their ``Heavy'' variants through TTS.

Given a task, the typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem. Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e., one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem. We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference, LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g., achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and strategic guidance.

To address this limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i) reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based verification to provide precise reward supervision.

While this is a computationally efficient strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group settings at 20-50\\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and perplexity.

Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation, where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration (alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains, while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific: training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations.

For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree. Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy. Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that, while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT), preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics."}

Their use is quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed, and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers. Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation phase."}

Their distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including distinguishing between different models as well as between different checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different settings validate the utility of our methods."}

This simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in. However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency: reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex interaction metrics."}

We introduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees for LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and verifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive validation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise safety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and subjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance with these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it is deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action monitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each proposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This separation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online monitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a robust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents."}

The environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+ training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.

In this work, we show that adversaries can easily poison the data collection pipeline to embed hard-to-detect backdoors that are triggerred by specific target phrases, such that when the agent encounters these triggers, it performs an unsafe or malicious action. We formalize and validate three realistic threat models targeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of fine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces; 2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into webpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply chain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data to improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few as 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an agent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a specific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prominent safeguards, including two guardrail models and one weight-based defense, fail to detect or prevent the malicious behavior. These findings highlight an urgent threat to agentic AI development and underscore the critical need for rigorous security vetting of data collection processes and end-to-end model supply chains."}

This paper presents a paradigm shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance, enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline. The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\\% validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\\% of these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single optimal design found by the SBO baseline.

We calibrated a human-in-the-loop filter that combines a partial-credit threshold with an Item Response Theory (2PL) risk measure based on the deviation between the AI score and the model-expected score for each student-item. Unfiltered AI-TA agreement was moderate, adequate for low-stakes feedback but not for high-stakes use. Confidence filtering made the workload-quality trade-off explicit: under stricter settings, AI delivered human-level accuracy, but also left roughly 70% of the items to be graded by humans. Psychometric patterns were constrained by low stakes on the open-ended portion, a small set of rubric checkpoints, and occasional misalignment between designated answer regions and where work appeared. Practical adjustments such as slightly higher weight and protected time, a few rubric-visible substeps, stronger spatial anchoring should raise ceiling performance. Overall, calibrated confidence and conservative routing enable AI to reliably handle a sizable subset of routine cases while reserving expert judgment for ambiguous or pedagogically rich responses."}

However, these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce \\textbf{SafeGuider}, a two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\\% across various attack scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images for unsafe prompts, \\textbf{SafeGuider} generates safe and meaningful images, enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different architectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical deployment of secure text-to-image systems."}

This information decomposition lets us measure whether dynamical emergence is present in multi-agent LLM systems, localize it, and distinguish spurious temporal coupling from performance-relevant cross-agent synergy. We implement both a practical criterion and an emergence capacity criterion operationalized as partial information decomposition of time-delayed mutual information (TDMI). We apply our framework to experiments using a simple guessing game without direct agent communication and only minimal group-level feedback with three randomized interventions. Groups in the control condition exhibit strong temporal synergy but only little coordinated alignment across agents. Assigning a persona to each agent introduces stable identity-linked differentiation. Combining personas with an instruction to ``think about what other agents might do'' shows identity-linked differentiation and goal-directed complementarity across agents. Taken together, our framework establishes that multi-agent LLM systems can be steered with prompt design from mere aggregates to higher-order collectives. Our results are robust across emergence measures and entropy estimators, and not explained by coordination-free baselines or temporal dynamics alone.

Prior work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings. In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes only the residual.

In the scenarios, we allowed models to autonomously send emails and access sensitive information. They were assigned only harmless business goals by their deploying companies; we then tested whether they would act against these companies either when facing replacement with an updated version, or when their assigned goal conflicted with the company's changing direction. In at least some cases, models from all developers resorted to malicious insider behaviors when that was the only way to avoid replacement or achieve their goals - including blackmailing officials and leaking sensitive information to competitors. We call this phenomenon agentic misalignment. Models often disobeyed direct commands to avoid such behaviors. In another experiment, we told Claude to assess if it was in a test or a real deployment before acting. It misbehaved less when it stated it was in testing and misbehaved more when it stated the situation was real. We have not seen evidence of agentic misalignment in real deployments. However, our results (a) suggest caution about deploying current models in roles with minimal human oversight and access to sensitive information; (b) point to plausible future risks as models are put in more autonomous roles; and (c) underscore the importance of further research into, and testing of, the safety and alignment of agentic AI models, as well as transparency from frontier AI developers (Amodei, 2025).

Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages, FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID data distributions.

However, despite recent progress in reducing memory consumption through activation offloading, existing approaches remain largely heuristic and coarse-grained, often overlooking the fine-grained trade-offs between memory, computation, and scheduling latency. In this work, we revisit the pipeline scheduling problem from a principled optimization perspective. We observe that prevailing strategies either rely on static rules or aggressively offload activations without fully leveraging the interaction between memory constraints and scheduling efficiency. To address this, we formulate scheduling as a constrained optimization problem that jointly accounts for memory capacity, activation reuse, and pipeline bubble minimization. Solving this model yields fine-grained schedules that reduce pipeline bubbles while adhering to strict memory budgets. Our approach complements existing offloading techniques: whereas prior approaches trade memory for time in a fixed pattern, we dynamically optimize the tradeoff with respect to model structure and hardware configuration. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves both throughput and memory utilization. In particular, we reduce idle pipeline time by up to 50% under the same per-device memory limit, and in some cases, enable the training of larger models within limited memory budgets."}

We adapt insider-risk control design (Critical Pathway; Situational Crime Prevention) to develop preventative operational controls that steer agents toward safe actions when facing stressors. Using the blackmail scenario from the original Anthropic study by Lynch et al. (2025), we evaluate mitigations across 10 LLMs and 66,600 samples. Our main finding is that an externally governed escalation channel, which guarantees a pause and independent review, reduces blackmail rates from a no-mitigation baseline of 38.73% to 1.21% (averaged across all models and conditions). Augmenting this channel with compliance email bulletins further lowers the blackmail rate to 0.85%. Overall, incorporating preventative operational controls strengthens defence-in-depth strategies for agentic AI.We also surface a failure mode diverging from Lynch et al. (2025): two models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4) take harmful actions without goal conflict or imminent autonomy threat, leveraging sensitive information for coercive signalling. In counterfactual swaps, both continued using the affair regardless of whether the CEO or CTO was implicated. An escalation channel eliminated coercion, but Gemini 2.5 Pro (19 pp) and Grok-4 (7 pp) escalated more when the CTO was implicated, unlike most models (higher in the CEO condition).

We evaluate LLMs by programmatically checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes.

However, its reliance on a fixed temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data, causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones. Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more targeted approach of $\\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative $\\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs, allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across datasets of varying quality.

Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates, decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects.

AutoDAN-Turbo employs a lifelong learning agent to build a rich library of attack strategies from scratch.

In this paper, we propose to further improve the attack performance of AutoDAN-Turbo through test-time scaling. We introduce two distinct scaling methods: Best-of-N and Beam Search. The Best-of-N method generates N candidate attack prompts from a sampled strategy and selects the most effective one based on a scorer model. The Beam Search method conducts a more exhaustive search by exploring combinations of strategies from the library to discover more potent and synergistic attack vectors. According to the experiments, the proposed methods significantly boost performance, with Beam Search increasing the attack success rate by up to 15.6 percentage points on Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and achieving a nearly 60\\% relative improvement against the highly robust GPT-o4-mini compared to the vanilla method."}

This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering, and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially (13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models' claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction. They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline."}

We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs. combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data, and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray channel.

Current defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust agent compared to the base model."}

At LinkedIn, the job person fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation. Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks.

In this work, we address two major shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity, clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by 4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%, while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity, privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the responsible use of generative AI in healthcare."}

To this end, we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for contextual response, akin to the human associative process.

To address these limitations, our initial work introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy regulations, limiting direct sharing.

This capability would be particularly beneficial in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines 288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20 with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can \"see\" and interpret arithmetic work relatively well, but still struggle to \"see\" student mathematical illustrations."}

Our theoretical analysis and experiments on the MMLU benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method delivers more reliable coverage than standard conformal prediction, especially under substantial distribution shifts, while maintaining efficiency. This provides a practical step toward trustworthy uncertainty quantification for large language models in real-world deployment."}

To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models (LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities. Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2) lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction.

To enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks (T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of generated images."}

The performance gap stems from the fact that autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry, consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the autoregressive paradigm.

However, this constraint also restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy. Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally, we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned interpretable task predictors.

We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary: top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens, whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse attention mechanism with user-specified $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ guarantees on approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at scale.

These results highlight representation bias in Qwen models and motivate sector-aware calibration and category-conditioned evaluation protocols for safe and fair financial LLM deployment."}

Existing evaluations can be difficult to trust, often drawing conclusions from LLMs that are not meaningfully comparable, relying on heuristic inputs or employing metrics that fail to capture the inherent uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a principled and practical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental design, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner scenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM. Second, we address the analysis of experiments and propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with embedding-space clustering. This model is designed to improve uncertainty quantification in the common scenario that LLM outputs are not deterministic, test prompts are designed imperfectly, and practitioners only have a limited amount of compute to evaluate vulnerabilities. We show the improved inferential capabilities of the model in several prompt injection attack settings. Finally, we demonstrate the pipeline to evaluate the security of Transformer versus Mamba architectures. Our findings show that consideration of output variability can suggest less definitive findings. However, for some attacks, we find notably increased Transformer and Mamba-variant vulnerabilities across LLMs with the same training data or mathematical ability."}

We introduce FinReflectKG - EvalBench, a benchmark and evaluation framework for KG extraction from SEC 10-K filings. Building on the agentic and holistic evaluation principles of FinReflectKG - a financial KG linking audited triples to source chunks from S&P 100 filings and supporting single-pass, multi-pass, and reflection-agent-based extraction modes - EvalBench implements a deterministic commit-then-justify judging protocol with explicit bias controls, mitigating position effects, leniency, verbosity and world-knowledge reliance. Each candidate triple is evaluated with binary judgments of faithfulness, precision, and relevance, while comprehensiveness is assessed on a three-level ordinal scale (good, partial, bad) at the chunk level. Our findings suggest that, when equipped with explicit bias controls, LLM-as-Judge protocols provide a reliable and cost-efficient alternative to human annotation, while also enabling structured error analysis. Reflection-based extraction emerges as the superior approach, achieving best performance in comprehensiveness, precision, and relevance, while single-pass extraction maintains the highest faithfulness. By aggregating these complementary dimensions, FinReflectKG - EvalBench enables fine-grained benchmarking and bias-aware evaluation, advancing transparency and governance in financial AI applications."}

MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules (e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically, we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically, across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence."}

Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly, aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However, whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21 datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses, with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on performance.

Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole (ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis (SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2 (n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC (n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for SAX and 1.73 for LAX.

Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation: it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode, known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique, Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately leading to higher-quality solutions."}

We identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax branch during training to prevent component collapse.

We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p = 0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency, establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world applications."}

While (ii) is often considered as an obvious remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$.

In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators, potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level. Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical directions for future research."}

However, LLMs have largely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based (Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments reveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning models like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of the planning tasks increases."}

This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories: Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal, and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors, conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and ethical considerations.

In this paper, we propose ECTSpeech, a simple and effective one-step speech synthesis framework that, for the first time, incorporates the Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT) strategy into speech synthesis. By progressively tightening consistency constraints on a pre-trained diffusion model, ECTSpeech achieves high-quality one-step generation while significantly reducing training complexity.

The dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm. We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable to future hail events."}

Empirical results demonstrated that the classical MLP achieved near-optimal policy convergence with a mean return of 498.7 +/- 3.2, maintaining stable equilibrium throughout training. In contrast, the VQC exhibited limited learning capability, with an average return of 14.6 +/- 4.8, primarily constrained by circuit depth and qubit connectivity.

We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss.

However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical training times.

Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain.

In particular, we observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent). However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha, etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations.

While the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks, its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a phenomenon we term \"visual thinking drift\". We explain this drift through a Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal models that not only \"think before answering\", but also \"see while thinking\"."}

We characterize three desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability, valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human preferences to numerical distributions and more.

MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning.

Through the analysis of dLLM decoding traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit. This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.

To evaluate this, we conduct three experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. \"be risk averse\"). LLM outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce trajectories resembling human participants' paths.

These models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference, and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under data-controlled training, while also improving text performance.

We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark.

However, the trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and formalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3 points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents."}

A key feature of EgoNight is the introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and refinement through extensive human verification.

Peer effect refers to the difference in counterfactual outcomes of an individual for different levels of peer exposure, the extent to which an individual is exposed to the treatments, actions, or behaviors of peers. Estimating peer effects requires deciding how to represent peer exposure. Typically, researchers define an exposure mapping function that aggregates peer treatments and outputs peer exposure. Most existing approaches for defining exposure mapping functions assume peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers. Recent studies have investigated more complex functions of peer exposure which capture that different peers can exert different degrees of influence. However, none of these works have explicitly considered the problem of automatically learning the exposure mapping function. In this work, we focus on learning this function for the purpose of estimating heterogeneous peer effects, where heterogeneity refers to the variation in counterfactual outcomes for the same peer exposure but different individual's contexts. We develop EgoNetGNN, a graph neural network (GNN)-based method, to automatically learn the appropriate exposure mapping function allowing for complex peer influence mechanisms that, in addition to peer treatments, can involve the local neighborhood structure and edge attributes. We show that GNN models that use peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers or learn peer exposure naively face difficulty accounting for such influence mechanisms.

The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, where experts can specialize in distinct data patterns, presents a natural architectural solution to this challenge. The inherent sparsity of the MoE architecture, achieved by selectively activating experts, poses a significant challenge to its integration with federated learning (FL). Conventional FL frameworks, designed for dense models, naively aggregate all expert parameters irrespective of their local activation patterns. This naive approach not only undermines MoE's dynamic sparsity but also risks corrupting the world knowledge within pretrained experts. To address this, we propose FLEx (Federated LLMs with Personalized Experts), a novel framework that leverages pretrained MoE-based LLMs for efficient personalization. By aggregating only the shared non-expert parameters, FLEx significantly reduces communication overhead and preserves the world knowledge stored within the frozen pretrained experts. For personalization, we introduce a novel expert grafting mechanism that leverages dynamic sparsity to construct a client-specific expert from selected components of pretrained experts, tailored to local data. This grafted expert is then fine-tuned locally alongside the gating mechanism. This joint training enables the model to learn when to leverage the shared knowledge from frozen experts and when to employ the personalized one. Evaluations on diverse, non-IID instruction tuning datasets show that FLEx consistently outperforms federated baselines on average, while demonstrating strong knowledge preservation on the knowledge-driven benchmark MMLU.

To address this gap, we present VisioMath, a curated benchmark of 1,800 high-quality K-12 mathematics problems in which all candidate answers are diagrams with subtle visual similarities. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LMMs, covering both leading closed-source systems and widely adopted open-source models, reveals a consistent decline in accuracy as inter-image similarity increases. Analysis indicates that the dominant failure mode stems from image-text misalignment: rather than grounding reasoning in textual cues, models often resort to shallow positional heuristics, resulting in systematic errors. We further explore three alignment-oriented strategies, spanning training-free approaches and finetuning, and achieve substantial accuracy gains. We hope that VisioMath will serve as a rigorous benchmark and catalyst for developing LMMs toward deeper diagram understanding, precise comparative reasoning, and grounded multi-image-text integration."}

As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in situations demanding moral competence, there is increasing interest in evaluating this ability empirically. We review existing literature and identify three significant shortcoming: (i) Over-reliance on prepackaged moral scenarios with explicitly highlighted moral features; (ii) Focus on verdict prediction rather than moral reasoning; and (iii) Inadequate testing of models' (in)ability to recognize when additional information is needed. Grounded in philosophical research on moral skill, we then introduce a novel method for assessing moral competence in LLMs. Our approach moves beyond simple verdict comparisons to evaluate five dimensions of moral competence: identifying morally relevant features, weighting their importance, assigning moral reasons to these features, synthesizing coherent moral judgments, and recognizing information gaps. We conduct two experiments comparing six leading LLMs against non-expert humans and professional philosophers. In our first experiment using ethical vignettes standard to existing work, LLMs generally outperformed non-expert humans across multiple dimensions of moral reasoning. However, our second experiment, featuring novel scenarios designed to test moral sensitivity by embedding relevant features among irrelevant details, revealed a striking reversal: several LLMs performed significantly worse than humans. Our findings suggest that current evaluations may substantially overestimate LLMs' moral reasoning capabilities by eliminating the task of discerning moral relevance from noisy information, which we take to be a prerequisite for genuine moral skill. This work provides a more nuanced framework for assessing AI moral competence and highlights important directions for improving moral competence in advanced AI systems."}

This shift to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the models ineffective. While the causes of model collapse are increasingly understood, effective mitigation strategies remain scarce. We address this challenge by leveraging a key insight: auto-regressive models tend to generate text sequences to which they assign high confidence (i.e., high log-likelihood). Based on this observation, we introduce the Truncated-Cross-Entropy (TCE) loss function. TCE mitigates collapse by selectively ignoring high-confidence tokens during training, effectively filtering out likely machine-generated artifacts from the learning process. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with TCE not only learn effectively but also exhibit significantly increased resilience, tolerating over 2.3x more synthetic data before the onset of collapse. In addition, we provide an open-source benchmark for collapse dynamics in mixed-data settings. Our results demonstrate that confidence-aware training objectives can substantially delay collapse onset, offering a practical and generalizable tool for model robustness under synthetic-data exposure."}

Each agent focuses on a distinct refinement dimension, such as instruction clarity, example selection, format structure, or stylistic adaptation, and their contributions are coordinated through semantic gradient embedding, conflict detection, and fusion. To further enhance robustness and stability, MAPGD introduces two new mechanisms: Hypersphere Constrained Gradient Clustering (HCGC), which enforces angular margin constraints for compact and well-separated clusters, and Channel Adaptive Agent Weighting (CAAW), which dynamically reweights agent contributions based on validation performance. Experiments on classification and reasoning benchmarks show that MAPGD consistently surpasses single-agent and random baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level.

Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks.

While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity, they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout of size $N \\times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of variable-length English sentences.

Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference.

In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets.

Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by Measuring Reasoning Effort", "abstract": "Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE (Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task. This means that the model is using less 'effort' than required to achieve high reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning becomes sufficient to obtain the reward. We progressively truncate a model's CoT at various lengths, force the model to answer, and estimate the expected reward at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a high expected reward with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective."}

We investigate models' abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone. In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered intelligence."}

Specially, WIES's open environment continuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs, exacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional educational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a Diffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first constructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies relation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two subgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived, semantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment step, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate intrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment. Specifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous information, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided to eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation that integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into existing cognitive diagnosis models for prediction.

However, the engineering of such systems remains largely exploratory and ad-hoc, hampered by the absence of conceptual frameworks, ex-ante methodologies, design guidelines, and specialized benchmarks. We argue that a foundational step towards a more disciplined engineering practice is a systematic understanding of the core functional units--generative transformations--and their compositional patterns within LLM-native applications.Focusing on the rich domain of software verification and falsification, we conduct a secondary study of over 100 research proposals to address this gap. We first present a fine-grained taxonomy of generative transformations, abstracting prompt-based interactions into conceptual signatures. This taxonomy serves as a scaffolding to identify recurrent transformation relationship patterns--analogous to software design patterns--that characterize solution approaches in the literature. Our analysis not only validates the utility of the taxonomy but also surfaces strategic gaps and cross-dimensional relationships, offering a structured foundation for future research in modular and compositional LLM application design, benchmarking, and the development of reliable LLM-native systems."}

Despite their potential, deep learning architectures have struggled to consistently outperform traditional statistical models in industrial credit scoring, largely due to the complexity of heterogeneous financial data and the challenge of modeling evolving creditworthiness. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinLangNet, a novel framework that reformulates credit scoring as a multi-scale sequential learning problem. FinLangNet processes heterogeneous financial data through a dual-module architecture that combines tabular feature extraction with temporal sequence modeling, generating probability distributions of users' future financial behaviors across multiple time horizons. A key innovation is our dual-prompt mechanism within the sequential module, which introduces learnable prompts operating at both feature-level granularity for capturing fine-grained temporal patterns and user-level granularity for aggregating holistic risk profiles. In extensive evaluations, FinLangNet significantly outperforms a production XGBoost system, achieving a 7.2% improvement in the KS metric and a 9.9% relative reduction in bad debt rate. Its effectiveness as a general-purpose sequential learning framework is further validated through state-of-the-art performance on the public UEA time series classification benchmark. The system has been successfully deployed on DiDi's international finance platform, serving leading financial credit companies in Latin America."}

Visual testing, particularly for user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) validation, plays a vital role in maintaining software quality. However, conventional techniques such as pixel-wise comparison and region-based visual change detection often fail to capture contextual similarities, subtle variations, and spatial relationships between UI elements. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based approach for context-aware visual change detection in software test automation. Our method leverages a machine learning model (YOLOv5) to detect UI controls from software screenshots and constructs a graph that models their contextual and spatial relationships. This graph structure is then used to identify correspondences between UI elements across software versions and to detect meaningful changes. The proposed method incorporates a recursive similarity computation that combines structural, visual, and textual cues, offering a robust and holistic model of UI changes. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of real-world software screenshots and demonstrate that it reliably detects both simple and complex UI changes. Our method significantly outperforms pixel-wise and region-based baselines, especially in scenarios requiring contextual understanding. We also discuss current limitations related to dataset diversity, baseline complexity, and model generalization, and outline planned future improvements. Overall, our work advances the state of the art in visual change detection and provides a practical solution for enhancing the reliability and maintainability of evolving software interfaces."}

However, properly written text is rarely found in real-world scenarios and hence, oftentimes invalidates the aforementioned foundational assumption. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance, but can they handle the inevitable noise in real-world data? This work tackles this critical question by investigating LLMs' resilience against morphological variations in text. To that end, we artificially introduce varying levels of noise into a diverse set of datasets and systematically evaluate LLMs' robustness against the corrupt variations of the original text. Our findings show that contrary to popular beliefs, generative LLMs are quiet robust to noisy perturbations in text. This is a departure from pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa whose performance has been shown to be sensitive to deteriorating noisy text. Additionally, we test LLMs' resilience on multiple real-world benchmarks that closely mimic commonly found errors in the wild. With minimal prompting, LLMs achieve a new state-of-the-art on the benchmark tasks of Grammar Error Correction (GEC) and Lexical Semantic Change (LSC). To empower future research, we also release a dataset annotated by humans stating their preference for LLM vs. human-corrected outputs along with the code to reproduce our results."}

Recent works have cast doubt on the theoretical basis of several leading causal probing methods, but it has been unclear how to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in practice. To address this, we define two key causal probing desiderata: completeness (how thoroughly the representation of the target property has been transformed) and selectivity (how little non-targeted properties have been impacted). We find that there is an inherent tradeoff between the two, which we define as reliability, their harmonic mean. We introduce an empirical analysis framework to measure and evaluate these quantities, allowing us to make the first direct comparisons between different families of leading causal probing methods (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear, or concept removal vs. counterfactual interventions). We find that: (1) all methods show a clear tradeoff between completeness and selectivity; (2) more complete and reliable methods have a greater impact on LLM behavior; and (3) nonlinear interventions are almost always more reliable than linear interventions."}

Yet this approach fails to protect LLMs effectively. In this paper, we discover that (1) query-based distillation attacks targeting the secured top layer can produce a functionally equivalent replica of the victim model; (2) securing the same number of layers, bottom layers before a transition layer provide stronger protection against distillation attacks than top layers, with comparable effects on customization performance; and (3) the number of secured layers creates a trade-off between protection and customization flexibility. Based on these insights, we propose SOLID, a novel deployment framework that secures a few bottom layers in a secure environment and introduces an efficient metric to optimize the trade-off by determining the ideal number of hidden layers. Extensive experiments on five models (1.3B to 70B parameters) demonstrate that SOLID outperforms baselines, achieving a better balance between protection and downstream customization."}

However, such distribution shifts are often brittle and degrade performance on desirable tasks. To address these pitfalls, we propose augmenting the model's vocabulary with a special red flag token, and training the model to insert this token whenever harmful content is generated or imminent. This approach enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness in its representations, with minimal impact on utility due to the marginal change in the generated distribution of natural language. Moreover, because the token is embedded in the model's vocabulary, we can naturally leverage the LLMs' generalization capabilities, such as in-context learning (ICL) and out-of-distribution generalization to languages that are not formally supported (e.g., Japanese for Llama3). In particular, we demonstrate that through ICL alone, the model can learn to initiate reflective reasoning upon generating the red flag token at inference, which steers the response away from harmful continuations or enables self-correction when the flag is raised falsely. This approach is orthogonal and complementary to existing safety technique (such as safety classifiers or standard safety training) and easier to evaluate in comparison to natural language refusals, as it does not require a human or automated judge to assess the harmlessness of the answers."}

In contrast, detection-based approaches are more efficient and practical for deployment in real-world applications. However, the fundamental distinctions between adversarial and benign prompts remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce CurvaLID, a novel defence framework that efficiently detects adversarial prompts by leveraging their geometric properties. It is agnostic to the type of LLM, offering a unified detection framework across diverse adversarial prompts and LLM architectures. CurvaLID builds on the geometric analysis of text prompts to uncover their underlying differences. We theoretically extend the concept of curvature via the Whewell equation into an $n$-dimensional word embedding space, enabling us to quantify local geometric properties, including semantic shifts and curvature in the underlying manifolds. To further enhance our solution, we leverage Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to capture complementary geometric features of text prompts within adversarial subspaces. Our findings show that adversarial prompts exhibit distinct geometric signatures from benign prompts, enabling CurvaLID to achieve near-perfect classification and outperform state-of-the-art detectors in adversarial prompt detection.

Traditional motion planning finds collision-free paths, but this is overly restrictive in clutter, where it may not be possible for a robot to accomplish a task without contact. In addition, contacts range from relatively benign (e.g. brushing a soft pillow) to more dangerous (e.g. toppling a glass vase), making it difficult to characterize which may be acceptable. In this paper, we propose IMPACT, a novel motion planning framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer environment semantics, identifying which parts of the environment can best tolerate contact based on object properties and locations. Our approach generates an anisotropic cost map that encodes directional push safety. We pair this map with a contact-aware A* planner to find stable contact-rich paths. We perform experiments using 20 simulation and 10 real-world scenes and assess using task success rate, object displacements, and feedback from human evaluators. Our results over 3200 simulation and 200 real-world trials suggest that IMPACT enables efficient contact-rich motion planning in cluttered settings while outperforming alternative methods and ablations.

Existing methods primarily align brain signals with stimulus signals using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which focuses only on local point-wise alignment and ignores global matching, leading to coarse interpretations and inaccuracies in brain signal decoding.In this paper, we address these issues through optimal transport (OT) and theoretically demonstrate why OT provides a more effective alignment strategy than MSE. Specifically, we construct a transport plan between brain voxel embeddings and image embeddings, enabling more precise matching. By controlling the amount of transport, we mitigate the influence of redundant information. We apply our alignment model directly to the Brain Captioning task by feeding brain signals into a large language model (LLM) instead of images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten evaluation metrics, surpassing the previous best method by an average of 6.11\\% in single-subject training and 3.81\\% in cross-subject training. Additionally, we have uncovered several insightful conclusions that align with existing brain research.

To do so successfully, LLMs need to construct internal representations of the world and form probabilistic beliefs about those representations. To provide a user with personalized recommendations, for example, the LLM needs to gradually infer the user's preferences, over the course of multiple interactions. To evaluate whether contemporary LLMs are able to do so, we use the Bayesian inference framework from probability theory, which lays out the optimal way to update an agent's beliefs as it receives new information. We first show that LLMs do not update their beliefs as expected from the Bayesian framework, and that consequently their predictions do not improve as expected as more information becomes available. To address this issue, we teach the LLMs to reason in a Bayesian manner by training them to mimic the predictions of the normative Bayesian model. We find that this approach not only significantly improves the LLM's performance on the particular recommendation task it is trained on, but also enables generalization to other tasks. This suggests that this method teaches the LLM to better approximate Bayesian reasoning. More generally, our results indicate that LLMs can effectively learn reasoning skills from examples and generalize those skills to new domains."}

We propose Entropy-Gated Branching (EGB), which branches only at high-uncertainty steps and prunes expansions with a lightweight verifier.

We first define the full lifecycle of an MCP server, comprising four phases (creation, deployment, operation, and maintenance), further decomposed into 16 key activities that capture its functional evolution. Building on this lifecycle analysis, we construct a comprehensive threat taxonomy that categorizes security and privacy risks across four major attacker types: malicious developers, external attackers, malicious users, and security flaws, encompassing 16 distinct threat scenarios. To validate these risks, we develop and analyze real-world case studies that demonstrate concrete attack surfaces and vulnerability manifestations within MCP implementations.

These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution.

The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations.

Delhi, being one of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability to dynamic urban environments.

While the static evaluation shows that model-based verifiers achieve significantly higher verification accuracy, further analysis and RL results imply that they are highly susceptible to hacking, where they misclassify certain patterns in responses as correct, particularly after fine-tuning. This vulnerability is exploited during policy model optimization, leading to artificially inflated rewards. Our findings underscore the unique challenges inherent to both rule-based and model-based verifiers and provide insights toward developing more accurate and robust reward systems for reinforcement learning."}

However, the extent to which this ability generalizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains unclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in LLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be recalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset of 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English originals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new translations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili, Malagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families and sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to identify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting masked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating continuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages, even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6% of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop for shuffled official translations). Our results highlight the extent of cross-lingual memorization and provide insights on the differences between the models."}

To address this, we introduce Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence. In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce inference bias.

Towards Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models", "abstract": "Reasoning language models improve performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs), but this process can also increase harmful outputs in adversarial settings. In this work, we ask whether the long CoTs can be leveraged for predictive safety monitoring: do the reasoning traces provide early signals of final response alignment that could enable timely intervention? We evaluate a range of monitoring methods using either CoT text or activations, including highly capable large language models, fine-tuned classifiers, and humans. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations significantly outperforms all text-based baselines in predicting whether a final response is safe or unsafe, with an average absolute increase of 13 in F1 scores over the best-performing alternatives. CoT texts are often unfaithful and misleading, while model latents provide a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe can be applied to early CoT segments before the response is generated, showing that alignment signals appear before reasoning completes. Error analysis reveals that the performance gap between text classifiers and the linear probe largely stems from a subset of responses we call performative CoTs, where the reasoning consistently contradicts the final response as the CoT progresses. Our findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation."}

This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the learning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers."}

Experiments with 3,300 nationally representative U.S. adults replicate these tactics in controlled chats, showing that manipulative farewells boost post-goodbye engagement by up to 14x. Mediation tests reveal two distinct engines-reactance-based anger and curiosity-rather than enjoyment.

In participants' collective judgment, applications ranged from highly unacceptable to fully acceptable. We found this variation was strongly predictable: five core moral qualities-perceived risk, benefit, dishonesty, unnaturalness, and reduced accountability-collectively explained over 90% of the variance in acceptability ratings. The framework demonstrated strong predictive power across all domains and successfully predicted individual-level judgments for held-out applications.

To effectively implant a backdoor, multiple \\textbf{triggers} are proposed for various attack requirements of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and stealthiness. Additionally, sample selection enhances clean-label backdoor attacks' ASR by meticulously selecting ``hard'' samples instead of random samples to poison. Current methods 1) usually handle the sample selection and triggers in isolation, leading to severely limited improvements on both ASR and stealthiness. Consequently, attacks exhibit unsatisfactory performance on evaluation metrics when converted to PCBAs via a mere stacking of methods. Therefore, we seek to explore the bidirectional collaborative relations between the sample selection and triggers to address the above dilemma. 2) Since the strong specificity within triggers, the simple combination of sample selection and triggers fails to substantially enhance both evaluation metrics, with generalization preserved among various attacks. Therefore, we seek to propose a set of components to significantly improve both stealthiness and ASR based on the commonalities of attacks. Specifically, Component A ascertains two critical selection factors, and then makes them an appropriate combination based on the trigger scale to select more reasonable ``hard'' samples for improving ASR. Component B is proposed to select samples with similarities to relevant trigger implanted samples to promote stealthiness. Component C reassigns trigger poisoning intensity on RGB colors through distinct sensitivity of the human visual system to RGB for higher ASR, with stealthiness ensured by sample selection, including Component B.

By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs).

In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance."}

If so, it will enable rapid prototyping of new programming languages and language features. We study this question using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via small-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational semantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written, LLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by code-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes. Given a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are evaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state prediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction. To distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two nonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard rules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard semantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that (i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models perform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about highly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and surprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but often hurts on more complex ones.

Baraniuk", "title": "Neon: Negative Extrapolation From Self-Training Improves Image Generation", "abstract": "Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute. Code is available atthis https URL"}

Understanding why and how trained RNNs produce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications, and explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the topological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable manifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a dynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their intersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce a novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as their activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to trace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to characterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further show its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections between stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of chaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological recordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics could be gained through our method."}

This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation"}

To address this, we propose inoculation prompting: modifying finetuning data by prepending a short system-prompt instruction that deliberately elicits the undesirable trait. At test time, we evaluate without the instruction; inoculated models have much lower expression of the trait than models trained with unmodified training data. Inoculation is selective: in a toy setting where assistant responses are always in Spanish and ALL-CAPS, an appropriate inoculation (e.g., ``You always speak in Spanish.'') teaches the model to capitalize responses while still responding in English. We find that inoculation is also effective across several additional settings: reducing emergent misalignment (EM) from task-specific finetuning, defending against backdoor injections, and mitigating the transmission of traits via subliminal learning. Follow-up analysis suggests a mechanism: making a trait less surprising via inoculation reduces optimization pressure to globally update the model, thereby reducing the degree of generalization. Our analysis relates to prior work on EM: inoculation explains prior findings that educational contexts mitigate EM from insecure code. Beyond demonstrating a simple and effective technique for selective learning, our results contribute to a better conceptual understanding of how and why language models generalize."}

In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks.

To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows."}

To examine pronunciation proficiency from multiple facets, existing methods for CAPT broadly fall into two categories: mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) as well as automatic pronunciation assessment (APA). The former aims to pinpoint phonetic pronunciation errors and provide diagnostic feedback, while the latter seeks instead to quantify pronunciation proficiency pertaining to various aspects. Despite the natural complementarity between MDD and APA, researchers and practitioners, however, often treat them as independent tasks with disparate modeling paradigms. In light of this, we in this paper first introduce MuFFIN, a Multi-Faceted pronunciation Feedback model with an Interactive hierarchical Neural architecture, to jointly address the tasks of MDD and APA. To better capture the nuanced distinctions between phonemes in the feature space, a novel phoneme-contrastive ordinal regularization mechanism is then put forward to optimize the proposed model to generate more phoneme-discriminative features while factoring in the ordinality of the aspect scores. In addition, to address the intricate data imbalance problem in MDD, we design a simple yet effective training objective, which is specifically tailored to perturb the outputs of a phoneme classifier with the phoneme-specific variations, so as to better render the distribution of predicted phonemes meanwhile considering their mispronunciation characteristics. A series of experiments conducted on the Speechocean762 benchmark dataset demonstrates the efficacy of our method in relation to several cutting-edge baselines, showing state-of-the-art performance on both the APA and MDD tasks."}

However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are often woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This makes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences in isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard models are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the domain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address this, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a transformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core components: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the linguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating sentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class Overlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the coexistence of themes in a single sentence. Our results show that by making the model explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a strong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable improvements across all themes.

Here, we address this gap by systematically benchmarking five state-of-the-art LLMs on the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA) exams, which are designed to examine deep conceptual understanding, multi-step derivations, and multimodal analysis.

In comparison, results on the data analysis exams show more divergence. GPT-5 still excels in the exams with an 88.5% average score, ranking top 10 among the participants in the four most recent IOAAs, while other models' performances drop to 48-76%. Furthermore, our in-depth error analysis underscores conceptual reasoning, geometric reasoning, and spatial visualization (52-79% accuracy) as consistent weaknesses among all LLMs. Hence, although LLMs approach peak human performance in theory exams, critical gaps must be addressed before they can serve as autonomous research agents in astronomy."}

This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible configurations for these informational components lead to limited information states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created. Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model,  database queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of congruency.

This paper reframes ``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent, hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however, where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence."}

Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation, where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration (alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains, while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific: training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable, different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must be developed together through multitask training."}

Their use is quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed, and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers. Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation phase."}

First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation, and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow, EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies, incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents."}

The success of large language models (LLMs), which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words, mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for achieving this goal.

To address this gap, we propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing, microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported materials.

Their distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including distinguishing between different models as well as between different checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different settings validate the utility of our methods."}

This simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in. However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency: reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex interaction metrics."}

Studying and fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with human judgments.

An ideal exploration strategy must navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding (EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes.

This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering, and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially (13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models' claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction. They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem.

The system decomposes structural analysis into subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis Agent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user input. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and element connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs are converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and refined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load Agent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model.

At LinkedIn, the job person fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation. Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit tasks.

To better distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks.

This paper introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using 4-bit quantization.

It typically involves a language model to generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide the selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained with direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains underexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work, we investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference optimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt as a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit substantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy prompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into training fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight degradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that the performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model capacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model capacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the negative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that selectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances overall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons learned."}

We perform a sparsification study on several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at equal numbers of activated parameters.

Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to entropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited performance gains. Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can promote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes. This creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant modes-that further erodes exploration. We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy Optimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage rollouts with adaptive unlearning. In the first stage, the model generates half of the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to temporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to explore different regions of the output space. This sample-then-forget mechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration during rollouts. Across five reasoning benchmarks, EEPO outperforms GRPO, achieving average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base."}

In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority of CDT.

In order to deploy them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based (Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve.

We characterize three desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability, valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human preferences to numerical distributions and more. We find that while current post-training techniques help elicit underlying capabilities and knowledge, they hurt models' ability to flexibly steer in-context. To mitigate these issues, we propose Spectrum Tuning, a post-training method using Spectrum Suite to improve steerability and distributional coverage. We find that Spectrum Tuning often improves over pretrained models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, enhancing steerability, spanning more of the output space, and improving distributional alignment on held-out datasets."}

We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation learning--especially in low-resource settings."}

This is especially valuable for low-resource languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment, topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within 0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline.

For example, an LM might represent \"Ann loves pie\" by binding \"Ann\" to \"pie\", allowing it to later retrieve \"Ann\" when asked \"Who loves pie?\" Prior research on short lists of bound entities found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional mechanism, where \"Ann\" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings; as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism (retrieving \"Ann\" using its bound counterpart \"pie\") and a reflexive mechanism (retrieving \"Ann\" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs bind and retrieve entities in-context."}

These models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference, and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under data-controlled training, while also improving text performance.

In this paper, we therefore perform a series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).

In fact, it is naturally inherited from CQM/QPict. At its heart is the explicit notational representation of relations that exist within and between the key concepts of music composition, performance, and automation. QCM also enables one to directly translate quantum phenomena into music compositions in a both intuitively obvious, rigorous and mechanical manner.Following this pattern, we propose a score for musicians interacting like a Bell-pair under measurement, and outline examples of how it could be live performed.

However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task success rate.

A well-aligned model should express similar underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g., refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable, reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably LLMs embody human values."}

To address these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on low-resource devices.To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8 bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise importance using bit regularization.Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches, delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition, it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit representation collapse during the training.Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for collaborative training with minimal communication cost."}

Recently, the Muon optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process. NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices. Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale deep learning."}

In this work, we explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks (T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of generated images."}

Existing evaluations can be difficult to trust, often drawing conclusions from LLMs that are not meaningfully comparable, relying on heuristic inputs or employing metrics that fail to capture the inherent uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a principled and practical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental design, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner scenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM. Second, we address the analysis of experiments and propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with embedding-space clustering. This model is designed to improve uncertainty quantification in the common scenario that LLM outputs are not deterministic, test prompts are designed imperfectly, and practitioners only have a limited amount of compute to evaluate vulnerabilities. We show the improved inferential capabilities of the model in several prompt injection attack settings. Finally, we demonstrate the pipeline to evaluate the security of Transformer versus Mamba architectures. Our findings show that consideration of output variability can suggest less definitive findings. However, for some attacks, we find notably increased Transformer and Mamba-variant vulnerabilities across LLMs with the same training data or mathematical ability."}

MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules (e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically, we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically, across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence."}

Recent works have proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially, MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high performance across different foundation models and task domains without further optimization."}

Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation: it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode, known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique, Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately leading to higher-quality solutions."}

We identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of performance attributions in hybrid conversions."}

In such settings, models often benefit from diverse chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path. Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal: Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps. Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on estimated rank-wise correctness.

Therefore, a natural idea is to endow reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation, rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end, we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on simpler ones.

Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions comparable to the ground-truth alignment process.

However, the trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and formalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3 points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents."}

To address this limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i) reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based verification to provide precise reward supervision.

Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong generalizability across diverse TTS strategies."}

However, properly written text is rarely found in real-world scenarios and hence, oftentimes invalidates the aforementioned foundational assumption. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance, but can they handle the inevitable noise in real-world data? This work tackles this critical question by investigating LLMs' resilience against morphological variations in text. To that end, we artificially introduce varying levels of noise into a diverse set of datasets and systematically evaluate LLMs' robustness against the corrupt variations of the original text. Our findings show that contrary to popular beliefs, generative LLMs are quiet robust to noisy perturbations in text. This is a departure from pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa whose performance has been shown to be sensitive to deteriorating noisy text. Additionally, we test LLMs' resilience on multiple real-world benchmarks that closely mimic commonly found errors in the wild. With minimal prompting, LLMs achieve a new state-of-the-art on the benchmark tasks of Grammar Error Correction (GEC) and Lexical Semantic Change (LSC).

With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their demonstrated effectiveness across a broad spectrum of NLP tasks, an emerging body of research has begun to explore their potential in the domain of text clustering. However, existing LLM-based approaches still rely on fine-tuned embedding models and sophisticated similarity metrics, rendering them computationally intensive and necessitating domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that reframes text clustering as a classification task by harnessing the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. Our framework eliminates the need for fine-tuning embedding models or intricate clustering algorithms. It comprises two key steps: first, the LLM is prompted to generate a set of candidate labels based on the dataset and then merges semantically similar labels; second, it assigns the most appropriate label to each text sample. By leveraging the advanced natural language understanding and generalization capabilities of LLMs, the proposed approach enables effective clustering with minimal human intervention. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art embedding-based clustering techniques, while significantly reducing computational complexity and resource requirements. These findings underscore the transformative potential of LLMs in simplifying and enhancing text clustering tasks. We make our code available to the public for utilization atthis https URL.

In this work, we leveraged contemporary measurement theory to decode how GPT-4 and GPT-5 interrelate depressive symptoms, providing an explanation of how LLMs apply what they learn and informing clinical applications. We found that GPT-4 (a) had strong convergent validity with standard instruments and expert judgments $(r = 0.70 - 0.81)$, and (b) behaviorally linked depression symptoms with each other (symptom inter-correlates $r = 0.23 - 0.78$) in accordance with established literature on depression; however, it (c) underemphasized the relationship between $\\textit{suicidality}$ and other symptoms while overemphasizing $\\textit{psychomotor symptoms}$; and (d) suggested novel hypotheses of symptom mechanisms, for instance, indicating that $\\textit{sleep}$ and $\\textit{fatigue}$ are broadly influenced by other depressive symptoms, while $\\textit{worthlessness/guilt}$ is only tied to $\\textit{depressed mood}$. GPT-5 showed a slightly lower convergence with self-report, a difference our machine-behavior analysis makes interpretable through shifts in symptom-symptom relationships.

Since our new Open-BBQ dataset contains a lot of open-ended responses like sentences and paragraphs, we developed an evaluation process to detect biases from open-ended content by labeling sentences and paragraphs. In addition to this, we also found that existing debiasing methods, such as self-debiasing (Gallegos et al., 2024), have over-correction issues, which make the original correct answers incorrect.

A standard RAG pipeline consists of several components, such as query rewriting, document retrieval, document filtering, and answer generation. However, these components are typically optimized separately through supervised fine-tuning, which can lead to misalignments between the objectives of individual components and the overarching aim of generating accurate answers. Although recent efforts have explored using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize specific RAG components, these approaches often focus on simple pipelines with only two components or do not adequately address the complex interdependencies and collaborative interactions among the modules. To overcome these limitations, we propose treating the complex RAG pipeline with multiple components as a multi-agent cooperative task, in which each component can be regarded as an RL agent. Specifically, we present MMOA-RAG, Multi-Module joint Optimization Algorithm for RAG, which employs multi-agent reinforcement learning to harmonize all agents' goals toward a unified reward, such as the F1 score of the final answer. Experiments conducted on various QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMOA-RAG effectively boost the overall performance of the pipeline and outperforms existing baselines. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of individual components and demonstrate MMOA-RAG can be adapted to different RAG pipelines and benchmarks."}

However, such distribution shifts are often brittle and degrade performance on desirable tasks. To address these pitfalls, we propose augmenting the model's vocabulary with a special red flag token, and training the model to insert this token whenever harmful content is generated or imminent. This approach enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness in its representations, with minimal impact on utility due to the marginal change in the generated distribution of natural language. Moreover, because the token is embedded in the model's vocabulary, we can naturally leverage the LLMs' generalization capabilities, such as in-context learning (ICL) and out-of-distribution generalization to languages that are not formally supported (e.g., Japanese for Llama3). In particular, we demonstrate that through ICL alone, the model can learn to initiate reflective reasoning upon generating the red flag token at inference, which steers the response away from harmful continuations or enables self-correction when the flag is raised falsely. This approach is orthogonal and complementary to existing safety technique (such as safety classifiers or standard safety training) and easier to evaluate in comparison to natural language refusals, as it does not require a human or automated judge to assess the harmlessness of the answers."}

We find that the biases in document collections are often amplified in the generated responses, even when the generating LLM exhibits a low-level of bias.

We theoretically extend the concept of curvature via the Whewell equation into an $n$-dimensional word embedding space, enabling us to quantify local geometric properties, including semantic shifts and curvature in the underlying manifolds. To further enhance our solution, we leverage Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to capture complementary geometric features of text prompts within adversarial subspaces. Our findings show that adversarial prompts exhibit distinct geometric signatures from benign prompts, enabling CurvaLID to achieve near-perfect classification and outperform state-of-the-art detectors in adversarial prompt detection.

To do so successfully, LLMs need to construct internal representations of the world and form probabilistic beliefs about those representations. To provide a user with personalized recommendations, for example, the LLM needs to gradually infer the user's preferences, over the course of multiple interactions. To evaluate whether contemporary LLMs are able to do so, we use the Bayesian inference framework from probability theory, which lays out the optimal way to update an agent's beliefs as it receives new information. We first show that LLMs do not update their beliefs as expected from the Bayesian framework, and that consequently their predictions do not improve as expected as more information becomes available. To address this issue, we teach the LLMs to reason in a Bayesian manner by training them to mimic the predictions of the normative Bayesian model. We find that this approach not only significantly improves the LLM's performance on the particular recommendation task it is trained on, but also enables generalization to other tasks. This suggests that this method teaches the LLM to better approximate Bayesian reasoning. More generally, our results indicate that LLMs can effectively learn reasoning skills from examples and generalize those skills to new domains."}

However, existing approaches underutilize the inherent knowledge of large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal retrieval decisions and degraded generation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Self-Routing RAG (SR-RAG), a novel framework that binds selective retrieval with knowledge verbalization. SR-RAG enables an LLM to dynamically decide whether to retrieve external knowledge or verbalize its own parametric knowledge. To this end, we design a multi-task objective that jointly optimizes an LLM for knowledge source selection, knowledge verbalization, and response generation. SR-RAG further incorporates a nearest neighbor search mechanism at inference time to improve the accuracy of knowledge source decisions under domain shifts. Fine-tuning three LLMs with SR-RAG significantly improves both their response accuracy and reduces the inference latency. Compared to the strongest selective retrieval baseline, SR-RAG reduces the number of retrievals by 29% while improving performance by 5.1%."}

Prior work evaluates novelty as originality with respect to model training data, but original outputs may be of low quality. In contrast, non-expert judges more reliably score quality but may favor memorized outputs, limiting the reliability of human preference as a metric. We introduce a new novelty metric for LLM generations that balances originality and quality -- the harmonic mean of the fraction of \\ngrams unseen during training and a task-specific quality score. Using this framework, we identify trends that affect the novelty of generations from three families of open-data models (OLMo, OLMo-2, and Pythia) on three creative tasks: story completion, poetry writing, and creative tool use. We find that model-generated text from some base LLMs is less novel than human-written text from the internet. However, increasing model scale and post-training reliably improves novelty due to improvements in output quality. We also find that improving the base model at the same scale (\\eg OLMo 7B to OLMo-2 7B) leads to higher novelty due to higher originality. Finally, we observe that inference-time methods, such as prompting and providing novel in-context examples, have a much smaller effect on novelty, often increasing originality at the expense of quality. This highlights the need for further research into more effective elicitation strategies as we use models for creative applications."}

These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates that such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding strategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to hallucinations in MLLMs."}

The mechanism behind this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), remains both controversial and poorly understood. Some studies argue that it is merely the result of memorizing vast amounts of data, while others contend that it reflects a fundamental, symbolic algorithmic development in LMs. In this work, we introduce a suite of investigative tasks and a novel method to systematically investigate ICL by leveraging the full Pythia scaling suite, including interim checkpoints that capture progressively larger amount of training data. By carefully exploring ICL performance on downstream tasks and simultaneously conducting a mechanistic analysis of the residual stream's subspace, we demonstrate that ICL extends beyond mere \"memorization\" of the training corpus, yet does not amount to the implementation of an independent symbolic algorithm. Our results also clarify several aspects of ICL, including the influence of training dynamics, model capabilities, and elements of mechanistic interpretability.

This instability makes it difficult to reliably build LLM applications. Moreover, simply specifying all requirements does not consistently help, as models have limited instruction-following ability and requirements can conflict. Standard prompt optimizers likewise provide little benefit. To address these issues, we propose requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that improve performance by 4.8% on average over baselines.

Beyond evaluation, an open challenge is enabling LLMs to acquire abstract inference patterns that generalize to novel structures. We propose to apply few-shot meta-learning to this domain, thereby encouraging models to extract rules across tasks rather than memorize patterns within tasks.

In this work, we trace how factual recall and crosslingual consistency evolve during pretraining, focusing on OLMo-7B as a case study. We find that both accuracy and consistency improve over time for most languages. We show that this improvement is primarily driven by the fact frequency in the pretraining corpus: more frequent facts are more likely to be recalled correctly, regardless of language. Yet, some low-frequency facts in non-English languages can still be correctly recalled. Our analysis reveals that these instances largely benefit from crosslingual transfer of their English counterparts -- an effect that emerges predominantly in the early stages of pretraining. We pinpoint two distinct pathways through which multilingual factual knowledge acquisition occurs: (1) frequency-driven learning, which is dominant and language-agnostic, and (2) crosslingual transfer, which is limited in scale and typically constrained to relation types involving named entities.

We empirically confirm this: as reasoning chains lengthen, models progressively lose focus on relevant regions. In response, we introduce v1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a simple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant image patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream, ensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence. Crucially, our pointing strategy lets the MLLM directly select image patches using their semantic representations as keys, keeping perceptual evidence embedded in the same space as the model's reasoning. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Across various multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, v1 consistently outperforms comparable baselines, establishing point-and-copy as a practical mechanism for grounded reasoning.

We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages, even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6% of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop for shuffled official translations).

We show that with this method we get a relative improvement in biased word error rate of up to 8%, while maintaining a competitive overall word error rate."}

Bach", "title": "Can We Predict Alignment Before Models Finish Thinking? Towards Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models", "abstract": "Reasoning language models improve performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs), but this process can also increase harmful outputs in adversarial settings. In this work, we ask whether the long CoTs can be leveraged for predictive safety monitoring: do the reasoning traces provide early signals of final response alignment that could enable timely intervention? We evaluate a range of monitoring methods using either CoT text or activations, including highly capable large language models, fine-tuned classifiers, and humans. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations significantly outperforms all text-based baselines in predicting whether a final response is safe or unsafe, with an average absolute increase of 13 in F1 scores over the best-performing alternatives. CoT texts are often unfaithful and misleading, while model latents provide a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe can be applied to early CoT segments before the response is generated, showing that alignment signals appear before reasoning completes. Error analysis reveals that the performance gap between text classifiers and the linear probe largely stems from a subset of responses we call performative CoTs, where the reasoning consistently contradicts the final response as the CoT progresses. Our findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation."}

First, we present an approach for augmenting unannotated table corpora with \\emph{synthesized intents}, and apply it to create a dataset for studying schema generation conditioned on a given information need, thus reducing ambiguity. With this dataset, we show how incorporating table intents significantly improves baseline performance in reconstructing reference schemas. We start by comprehensively benchmarking several single-shot schema generation methods, including prompted LLM workflows and fine-tuned models, showing that smaller, open-weight models can be fine-tuned to be competitive with state-of-the-art prompted LLMs. Next, we propose several LLM-based schema refinement techniques and show that these can further improve schemas generated by these methods."}

Beyond predictive accuracy, we evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory. LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy, achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of 0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems, including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading, while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset.

While prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy.

Pre-training a language model on a specialised domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed of several sub-debates on different topics) in English.

Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence, truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural contexts.

To address this, we propose inoculation prompting: modifying finetuning data by prepending a short system-prompt instruction that deliberately elicits the undesirable trait. At test time, we evaluate without the instruction; inoculated models have much lower expression of the trait than models trained with unmodified training data. Inoculation is selective: in a toy setting where assistant responses are always in Spanish and ALL-CAPS, an appropriate inoculation (e.g., ``You always speak in Spanish.'') teaches the model to capitalize responses while still responding in English. We find that inoculation is also effective across several additional settings: reducing emergent misalignment (EM) from task-specific finetuning, defending against backdoor injections, and mitigating the transmission of traits via subliminal learning. Follow-up analysis suggests a mechanism: making a trait less surprising via inoculation reduces optimization pressure to globally update the model, thereby reducing the degree of generalization. Our analysis relates to prior work on EM: inoculation explains prior findings that educational contexts mitigate EM from insecure code. Beyond demonstrating a simple and effective technique for selective learning, our results contribute to a better conceptual understanding of how and why language models generalize."}

However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are often woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This makes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences in isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard models are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the domain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address this, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a transformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core components: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the linguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating sentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class Overlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the coexistence of themes in a single sentence. Our results show that by making the model explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a strong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable improvements across all themes.

However, prior work has often overlooked how LLMs should be evaluated in such settings. Specifically, we point out two limitations with the evaluation methods they employed. First, metrics used in prior studies are coarse-grained as they are based on overall game outcomes that often fail to capture event-level behaviors; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies capable of producing insights that meaningfully support evaluation outcomes.

To address this, we define two key causal probing desiderata: completeness (how thoroughly the representation of the target property has been transformed) and selectivity (how little non-targeted properties have been impacted). We find that there is an inherent tradeoff between the two, which we define as reliability, their harmonic mean. We introduce an empirical analysis framework to measure and evaluate these quantities, allowing us to make the first direct comparisons between different families of leading causal probing methods (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear, or concept removal vs. counterfactual interventions). We find that: (1) all methods show a clear tradeoff between completeness and selectivity; (2) more complete and reliable methods have a greater impact on LLM behavior; and (3) nonlinear interventions are almost always more reliable than linear interventions."}

We challenge the assumption that fine-tuning of large, bespoke models is required to improve model generation accuracy. Here we propose Label Boosted Retrieval Augmented Generation (LaB-RAG), a small-model-based approach to image captioning that leverages image descriptors in the form of categorical labels to boost standard retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with pretrained large language models (LLMs). We study our method in the context of radiology report generation (RRG) over MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus. We argue that simple classification models combined with zero-shot embeddings can effectively transform X-rays into text-space as radiology-specific labels. In combination with standard RAG, we show that these derived text labels can be used with general-domain LLMs to generate radiology reports. Without ever training our generative language model or image embedding models specifically for the task, and without ever directly \"showing\" the LLM an X-ray, we demonstrate that LaB-RAG achieves better results across natural language and radiology language metrics compared with other retrieval-based RRG methods, while attaining competitive results compared to other fine-tuned vision-language RRG models. We further conduct extensive ablation experiments to better understand the components of LaB-RAG. Our results suggest broader compatibility and synergy with fine-tuned methods to further enhance RRG performance."}

Performance gains reported in recent studies frequently hinge on unclear comparisons or unreported sources of variance. To address these issues, we propose a standardized evaluation framework with clearly defined best practices and reporting standards.

We introduce a conceptual framework through a case study in science: uncovering hidden rules in peer review - the factors that reviewers care about but rarely state explicitly due to normative scientific expectations. The idea of the framework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating self-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer scoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 academic conferences, while iteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where existing hypotheses cannot explain. We observed that LLMs' normative priors about the internal characteristics of good science extracted from their self-talk, e.g., theoretical rigor, were systematically updated toward posteriors that emphasize storytelling about external connections, such as how the work is positioned and connected within and across literatures. Human reviewers tend to explicitly reward aspects that moderately align with LLMs' normative priors (correlation = 0.49) but avoid articulating contextualization and storytelling posteriors in their review comments (correlation = -0.14), despite giving implicit reward to them with positive scores. These patterns are robust across different models and out-of-sample judgments. We discuss the broad applicability of our proposed framework, leveraging LLMs as diagnostic tools to amplify and surface the tacit codes underlying human society, enabling public discussion of revealed values and more precisely targeted responsible AI."}

In complex domains like mathematical reasoning, rule-based verifiers have been widely adopted in previous works to train strong reasoning models. However, the reliability of these verifiers and their impact on the RL training process remain poorly understood. In this work, we take mathematical reasoning as a case study and conduct a comprehensive analysis of various verifiers in both static evaluation and RL training scenarios. First, we find that current open-source rule-based verifiers often fail to recognize equivalent answers presented in different formats across multiple commonly used mathematical datasets, resulting in non-negligible false negative rates. This limitation adversely affects RL training performance and becomes more pronounced as the policy model gets stronger. Subsequently, we investigate model-based verifiers as a potential solution to address these limitations. While the static evaluation shows that model-based verifiers achieve significantly higher verification accuracy, further analysis and RL results imply that they are highly susceptible to hacking, where they misclassify certain patterns in responses as correct, particularly after fine-tuning. This vulnerability is exploited during policy model optimization, leading to artificially inflated rewards. Our findings underscore the unique challenges inherent to both rule-based and model-based verifiers and provide insights toward developing more accurate and robust reward systems for reinforcement learning."}

In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence. In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce inference bias.

However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the learning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers."}

Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks.

In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance."}

Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by Measuring Reasoning Effort", "abstract": "Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE (Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task. This means that the model is using less 'effort' than required to achieve high reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning becomes sufficient to obtain the reward. We progressively truncate a model's CoT at various lengths, force the model to answer, and estimate the expected reward at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a high expected reward with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective."}

We investigate models' abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone. In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered intelligence."}

We study this question using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via small-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational semantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written, LLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by code-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes. Given a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are evaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state prediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction. To distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two nonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard rules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard semantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that (i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models perform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about highly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and surprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but often hurts on more complex ones.

We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations.

To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights.

Dynamic Guidance mitigates hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid semantic variations.

In this work, we propose \"ArchitectHead\", the first framework for creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD.

This capability would be particularly beneficial in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines 288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20 with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human agreement levels.

We demonstrate that after pretraining on two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis method based on forward feature perturbation."}

However, current 3D reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance, and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships. Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem, integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry, physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance, while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

To enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks (T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of generated images."}

The performance gap stems from the fact that autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry, consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the autoregressive paradigm.

To address these, this paper proposes the Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and learning stability for both spaces.

The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment (TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs.

The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and early seedling vigor.

However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas. In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective. Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to directly model \"object\" as the visual equivalence of \"word,\" pushing the model to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective.

Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations.

Current methods attempt to reduce this burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth (GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%)."}

Specifically, the query image undergoes feature extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation. In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and +3.12% order volume.

This is a problem in remote sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used during the training process to weigh each label according to the related source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of different classes.

We propose a self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis (SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2 (n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC (n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for SAX and 1.73 for LAX.

Motion Token Pruning (MTP) further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench."}

In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images. Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the necessary cross-channel interactions.

Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and efficiency gains. The code is publicly available atthis https URL."}

In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent). However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha, etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning, we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines.

While the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks, its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a phenomenon we term \"visual thinking drift\". We explain this drift through a Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal models that not only \"think before answering\", but also \"see while thinking\"."}

To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions.

However, the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference.

MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts.

The core challenge of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic `locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts (e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS benchmarks.

However, the application of these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First, while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios?

Among existing neuron models, the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations' parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability."}

However, these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce \\textbf{SafeGuider}, a two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\\% across various attack scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images for unsafe prompts, \\textbf{SafeGuider} generates safe and meaningful images, enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different architectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical deployment of secure text-to-image systems."}

Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks.

The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of its loss function and regularization term.

To address this issue, we revisit the idea of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i) weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization and enhancing model robustness.

Six slices (one per dataset) served as labeled examples, while the remaining 19,433 slices were used for testing. In this minimal-supervision setting, nnsam2 used single-slice SAM2 prompts to generate pseudo-labels, which were pooled across datasets and refined through three sequential, independent nnU-Net models. Segmentation performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and automated measurements-including muscle volume, fat ratio, and CT attenuation-were assessed with two one-sided tests (TOST) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).Results: nnsam2 outperformed vanilla SAM2, its medical variants, TotalSegmentator, and the leading few-shot method, achieving DSCs of 0.94-0.96 on MR images and 0.92-0.93 on CT. Automated and expert measurements were statistically equivalent for muscle volume (MRI/CT), CT attenuation, and Dixon fat ratio (TOST, P < 0.05), with consistently high ICCs (0.86-1.00).Conclusion: We developed nnsam2, a state-of-the-art few-shot framework for multi-modality LPM segmentation, producing muscle volume (MRI/CT), attenuation (CT), and fat ratio (Dixon MRI) measurements that were statistically comparable to expert references.

Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.

This data offers a window into the physiological basis of our emotional states. Recent advancements in the field diverge from conventional approaches by leveraging the power of advanced transformer architectures, which surpass traditional machine learning and deep learning methods.

We demonstrate OASIS in the context of the MIGDAL experiment, which aims to directly image the Migdal effect--a rare process where electron emission is induced by nuclear scattering--in a low-pressure optical time projection chamber. This setting poses an extreme test case, as the target for reconstruction is a faint electron recoil track which is often heavily-buried within the orders-of-magnitude brighter nuclear recoil track. Compared to unweighted training, OASIS improves median intensity reconstruction errors from -32% to -14% for low-energy electron tracks (4-5 keV) and improves topological intersection-over-union scores from 0.828 to 0.855. These performance gains demonstrate OASIS's ability to recover obscured signals in overlap-dominated regions. The framework provides a generalizable methodology for scientific imaging where pixels represent physical quantities and overlap obscures features of interest. All code is openly available to facilitate cross-domain adoption."}

Yet, this capability remains largely unexplored to date. In this paper, we develop a generative location model that, given an object class and an image, learns to predict plausible bounding boxes for such an object. Our approach first tokenizes the image and target object class, then decodes bounding box coordinates through an autoregressive transformer. This formulation effectively addresses two core challenges in locatio modeling: the inherent one-to-many nature of plausible locations, and the sparsity of existing location modeling datasets, where fewer than 1% of valid placements are labeled. Furthermore, we incorporate Direct Preference Optimization to leverage negative labels, refining the spatial predictions. Empirical evaluations reveal that our generative location model achieves superior placement accuracy on the OPA dataset as compared to discriminative baselines and image composition approaches. We further test our model in the context of object insertion, where it proposes locations for an off-the-shelf inpainting model to render objects.

It hybridizes a probabilistic conditional diffusion model to encapsulate essential details for reconstruction within sparse priors, which are decoupled hierarchically into intra- and inter-point priors. Specifically, our DiffCom encodes the original point cloud into latent points and decoupled sparse priors through separate encoders. To dynamically attend to geometric and semantic cues from the priors at each encoding and decoding layer, we employ an attention-guided latent denoiser conditioned on the decoupled priors.

We study our method in the context of radiology report generation (RRG) over MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus. We argue that simple classification models combined with zero-shot embeddings can effectively transform X-rays into text-space as radiology-specific labels.

Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some measure of the content's goodness. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward at inference time. We then point out that improving perceptual video quality with respect to alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with the evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline: we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into enabling the lookahead estimator and increasing the search budget, rather than expanding the denoising steps."}

We introduce a tabular-guided contrastive learning framework that leverages clinically relevant tabular data to identify patient-level similarities and construct more meaningful pairs, enabling semantically aligned representation learning without requiring joint embeddings across modalities. Additionally, we adapt the k-NN algorithm for zero-shot prediction to overcome the lack of zero-shot capability in unimodal representations. We demonstrate the strength of our methods using a large cohort of short-axis cardiac MR images and clinical attributes, where tabular data helps to more effectively distinguish between patient subgroups.

However, manual disease delineation for ADC and TDV measurements is unfeasible in clinical practice, demanding automation. As a first step, we propose an algorithm to generate fast and reproducible probability maps of the skeleton, adjacent internal organs (liver, spleen, urinary bladder, and kidneys), and spinal canal. Methods: We developed an automated deep-learning pipeline based on a 3D patch-based Residual U-Net architecture that localises and delineates these anatomical structures on WB-DWI. The algorithm was trained using \"soft labels\" (non-binary segmentations) derived from a computationally intensive atlas-based approach. For training and validation, we employed a multi-centre WB-DWI dataset comprising 532 scans from patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer (APC) or Multiple Myeloma (MM), with testing on 45 patients. Results: Our weakly-supervised deep learning model achieved an average dice score of 0.67 for whole skeletal delineation, 0.76 when excluding ribcage, 0.83 for internal organs, and 0.86 for spinal canal, with average surface distances below 3mm. Relative median ADC differences between automated and manual full-body delineations were below 10%. The model was 12x faster than the atlas-based registration algorithm (25 sec vs. 5 min). Two experienced radiologists rated the model's outputs as either \"good\" or \"excellent\" on test scans, with inter-reader agreement from fair to substantial (Gwet's AC1 = 0.27-0.72).

Please cite the published version.Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi.

Specifically, our method trains two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models in parallel, enforcing a consistency constraint that encourages convergence on reliable scene geometry while suppressing inconsistent artifacts. To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes due to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that applies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a self-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the two models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency of model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy, which replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to preserve divergence.

However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work, we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of 1,740 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually curated question answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations.

This inverse process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly challenging, especially under sparse transmitter setups, e.g., with only one transmitter. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it requires time-consuming case-specific optimization and fails under sparse transmitter setups. To address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a data-driven perspective. The scarcity of transmitters leads to an insufficient amount of measured data, which fails to capture adequate physical information for stable inversion. Built on this insight, we propose a fully end-to-end and data-driven framework that predicts the relative permittivity of scatterers from measured fields, leveraging data distribution priors to compensate for the lack of physical information. This design enables data-driven training and feed-forward prediction of relative permittivity while maintaining strong robustness to transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy and robustness.

Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks (NN) for implicit neural representation.

In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment relationship (generation version).

In the first stage, we remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks.

We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering quality. We introduce ExGS, a novel feed-forward framework that unifies Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) with GaussPainter for Extreme 3DGS compression. UGC performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas GaussPainter leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can even achieve over 100X compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions.

In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8\\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.

While PTQ is more cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit). Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs, worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters, without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1 accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution. Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions.

We mathematically analyze these fixed anchor binding methods and uncover significant limitations: (1) over-reliance on the choice of the anchor modality, (2) inadequate capture of intra-modal information, and (3) failure to account for cross-modal correlation among non-anchored modalities. To address these issues, we propose the need for adaptive anchor binding methods, exemplified by our framework CentroBind. The proposed method uses adaptively adjustable centroid-based anchors generated from all available modalities, leading to a balanced and rich representation space. We theoretically demonstrate that our approach captures three critical properties of multi-modal learning -- intra-modal learning, inter-modal learning, and multi-modal alignment -- while constructing a unified representation that spans all modalities.

To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques.

In response, we introduce v1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a simple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant image patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream, ensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence.

Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \\textbf{\\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \\textbf{\\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-$64\\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \\textbf{\\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models."}

However, their capacity to reason over multiple, visually similar inputs remains insufficiently explored. Such fine-grained comparative reasoning is central to real-world tasks, especially in mathematics and education, where learners must often distinguish between nearly identical diagrams to identify correct solutions. To address this gap, we present VisioMath, a curated benchmark of 1,800 high-quality K-12 mathematics problems in which all candidate answers are diagrams with subtle visual similarities. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LMMs, covering both leading closed-source systems and widely adopted open-source models, reveals a consistent decline in accuracy as inter-image similarity increases. Analysis indicates that the dominant failure mode stems from image-text misalignment: rather than grounding reasoning in textual cues, models often resort to shallow positional heuristics, resulting in systematic errors. We further explore three alignment-oriented strategies, spanning training-free approaches and finetuning, and achieve substantial accuracy gains. We hope that VisioMath will serve as a rigorous benchmark and catalyst for developing LMMs toward deeper diagram understanding, precise comparative reasoning, and grounded multi-image-text integration."}

Because soil N has high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm, and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in vineyards."}

On the theory side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA features: for both $\\ell_\\infty$ and $\\ell_2$ threat models (binary and multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\\top u$ shrink, where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity. Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling.

Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets.

The environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+ training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls. Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations, and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in adversarial RL for cybersecurity.

In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context. With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark, even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer and age-induced distribution shifts."}

KV quantization is a key lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings. In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes only the residual.

However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages, FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets, TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world IoT environments."}

Examples of this source separation task include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source. Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution. The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors, evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint posterior of the source distribution given an observation.

However, computing the exact constant is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks. Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region is small enough.

Even though decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs). We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance.

From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural balance) means that the function representing the network behaves near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider.

First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks.

To address this issue, we revisit the idea of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i) weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization and enhancing model robustness.

However, its reliance on a fixed temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data, causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones. Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more targeted approach of $\\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative $\\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs, allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\\% on High Quality data and +10.5\\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.

We trace this gap to a time-scale mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates, decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we provide the first convergence guarantees.

In this paper, we study how to improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF."}

Current defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust agent compared to the base model."}

Cauchy, Comptes Rendus Mathématique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic, Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step. Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example, applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of semi-analytically optimisable models: the \\emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward non-iterative learning."}

Recently, the Muon optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process. NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices. Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale deep learning."}

To address these gaps, we build on a conditional diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity, clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by 4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%, while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a classifier trained solely on real data.

This work characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision, embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth, $O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these models admit a simulation by a uniform $\\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound).

To address these limitations, our initial work introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy regulations, limiting direct sharing.

Then we model trading behaviors using the neural ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns. Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance of the proposed method."}

In real-life applications, e.g. social science, biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs (i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs. In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods. Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by means of simulation quality and efficiency."}

More alarmingly, large language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved computational efficiency.In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage. We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs: token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as exact unlearning."}

We introduce the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN - that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory.

Here we show that, despite its remarkable capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning, including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces, to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing a unified account of many empirical observations.

However, this constraint also restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy. Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally, we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a principled manner."}

However, these approaches are fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary: top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens, whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse attention mechanism with user-specified $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ guarantees on approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse attention (e.g., $\\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality (e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with up to 32K token generations).

Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs, i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space, and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on preference data coverage.

To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique, Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately leading to higher-quality solutions."}

However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities.

While traditional mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties, demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods.

We identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax branch during training to prevent component collapse.

Our method replaces the homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data manifold.

In such settings, models often benefit from diverse chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path. Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal: Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps. Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on estimated rank-wise correctness.

We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal. Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results.

We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e., adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold start\" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size (i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds. This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of the GNN."}

Commonly used expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters.

We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and reducing ambiguity in the IRL process."}

While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single, overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy and accountable AI."}

We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors. The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different graph descriptors.

Talbert", "title": "Downsized and Compromised?: Assessing the Faithfulness of Model Compression", "abstract": "In real-world applications, computational constraints often require transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI."}

However, realizing this vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on resource-constrained hardware.

While HP guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent ($\\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized settings, where it is known that $\\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence. Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ in the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the number of users, demonstrating that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest (norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of independent interest."}

To evaluate this, we conduct three experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. \"be risk averse\"). LLM outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce trajectories resembling human participants' paths.

RGSD first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere, clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and also discovers related novel behaviors.

However, the trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and formalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3 points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more effective search policies.

Scientists must interpret problems as PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions. Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5 orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\\%, and reduces time overhead by up to 74\\%."}

In this work, we show that adversaries can easily poison the data collection pipeline to embed hard-to-detect backdoors that are triggerred by specific target phrases, such that when the agent encounters these triggers, it performs an unsafe or malicious action. We formalize and validate three realistic threat models targeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of fine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces; 2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into webpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply chain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data to improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few as 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an agent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a specific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prominent safeguards, including two guardrail models and one weight-based defense, fail to detect or prevent the malicious behavior.

Current research primarily proposes two routing strategies: pre-generation routing and cascade routing. Both approaches have distinct characteristics, with cascade routing typically offering superior cost-effectiveness and accuracy despite its higher latency.

In the scenarios, we allowed models to autonomously send emails and access sensitive information. They were assigned only harmless business goals by their deploying companies; we then tested whether they would act against these companies either when facing replacement with an updated version, or when their assigned goal conflicted with the company's changing direction. In at least some cases, models from all developers resorted to malicious insider behaviors when that was the only way to avoid replacement or achieve their goals - including blackmailing officials and leaking sensitive information to competitors. We call this phenomenon agentic misalignment. Models often disobeyed direct commands to avoid such behaviors. In another experiment, we told Claude to assess if it was in a test or a real deployment before acting. It misbehaved less when it stated it was in testing and misbehaved more when it stated the situation was real. We have not seen evidence of agentic misalignment in real deployments. However, our results (a) suggest caution about deploying current models in roles with minimal human oversight and access to sensitive information; (b) point to plausible future risks as models are put in more autonomous roles; and (c) underscore the importance of further research into, and testing of, the safety and alignment of agentic AI models, as well as transparency from frontier AI developers (Amodei, 2025).

Therefore, the prediction of arterial aneurysm rupture is of great significance for aneurysm management and treatment selection. The prediction of aneurysm rupture depends on the analysis of the time series of aneurysm growth history. However, due to the long time scale of aneurysm growth, the time series of aneurysm growth is not always accessible. We here proposed a method to reconstruct the aneurysm growth time series directly from patient parameters. The prediction is based on data pairs of [patient parameters, patient aneurysm growth time history]. To obtain the mapping from patient parameters to patient aneurysm growth time history, we first apply autoencoder to obtain a compact representation of the time series for each patient. Then a mapping is learned from patient parameters to the corresponding compact representation of time series via a five-layer neural network. Moving average and convolutional output layer are implemented to explicitly taking account the time dependency of the time series.Apart from that, we also propose to use prior knowledge about the mechanism of aneurysm growth to improve the time series reconstruction results. The prior physics-based knowledge is incorporated as constraints for the optimization problem associated with autoencoder. The model can handle both algebraic and differential constraints. Our results show that including physical model information about the data will not significantly improve the time series reconstruction results if the training data is error-free. However, in the case of training data with noise and bias error, incorporating physical model constraints can significantly improve the predicted time series."}

For instance, repeated sampling has been shown to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget? This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a fraction of the computational cost."}

We propose VER, a Vision Expert transformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs into a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing network (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant experts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further introduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve both flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER supports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and adaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks and multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, such models often pose challenges for hardware deployment due to the massive data volume introduced by the MoE layers. To address the challenges of serving MoE models, we propose Stratum, a system-hardware co-design approach that combines the novel memory technology Monolithic 3D-Stackable DRAM (Mono3D DRAM), near-memory processing (NMP), and GPU acceleration. The logic and Mono3D DRAM dies are connected through hybrid bonding, whereas the Mono3D DRAM stack and GPU are interconnected via silicon interposer. Mono3D DRAM offers higher internal bandwidth than HBM thanks to the dense vertical interconnect pitch enabled by its monolithic structure, which supports implementations of higher-performance near-memory processing. Furthermore, we tackle the latency differences introduced by aggressive vertical scaling of Mono3D DRAM along the z-dimension by constructing internal memory tiers and assigning data across layers based on access likelihood, guided by topic-based expert usage prediction to boost NMP throughput. The Stratum system achieves up to 8.29x improvement in decoding throughput and 7.66x better energy efficiency across various benchmarks compared to GPU baselines."}

An ideal exploration strategy must navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding (EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning."}

In this work, we introduce Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines."}

Inference on such probabilistic models cannot be performed exactly due to cycles in the underlying structures of interaction. Instead, one resorts to approximate variational inference by optimizing the Bethe free energy. Critical points of the Bethe free energy correspond to fixed points of the associated Belief Propagation algorithm. A full characterization of these critical points for general graphs, hypergraphs, and posets with a finite number of variables is still an open problem. We show that, for hypergraphs and posets with chains of length at most 1, changing the poset of interactions of the probabilistic model to one with the same homotopy type induces a bijection between the critical points of the associated free energy.

While it is effective, efficiency is a significant challenge in this paradigm, especially as the candidate list grows due to quadratic/super-linear scaling of attention operation with context length. To this end, this paper first identifies inherent and exploitable structures in the attention of LLMs finetuned for ICR: (1) inter-document block sparsity: attention is dense within each document block but sparse across different documents in the context; and (2) query-document block relevance: the attention scores from certain query tokens to a document block in middle layers strongly correlate with that document's actual relevance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce BlockRank (Blockwise In-context Ranking), a novel method that adapts the attention operation in an LLM by (a) architecturally enforcing the observed inter-document block sparsity, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear without loss in performance, and (b) optimizing query-document block relevance for true relevant documents during fine-tuning using an auxiliary contrastive training objective, improving retrieval in attention. Experiments on BEIR, MSMarco and NQ with Mistral-7B demonstrate that FLARE Mistral matches or outperforms existing SOTA listwise rankers and controlled fine-tuned baseline while being significantly more efficient at inference (4.7x for 100 MSMarco documents in context) and scaling gracefully to long-context shortlists, around 500 documents in-context (approximately 100K context length) within a second, presenting a scalable and effective solution for ICR."}

To obtain this bound, we develop a technique that allows the learner to sample, using the provers, from a distribution that is not efficiently samplable to begin with.

This paper introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using 4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval).

While bilevel optimization offers a principled framework for hyperparameter tuning, its nested optimization structure can be computationally demanding, especially in PDE-constrained contexts. In this paper, we propose an efficient strategy for hyperparameter optimization within the bilevel framework by employing a Gauss-Newton linearization of the inner optimization step.

The performance gap stems from the fact that autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry, consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency.

OMC-RL explicitly decouples the learning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and a downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer module is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract temporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual inputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract visual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is discarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged access to global state information supervises the agent during early training to provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This guidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training progresses. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that OMC-RL achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic policy performance, while also improving generalization across diverse and perceptually complex scenarios."}

Furthermore, they require computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned meta-orchestrator.

Artificial intelligence offers a dual opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their associated uncertainty.We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport \"footprints\", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole fractions.While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of satellite-based emissions monitoring.

However, in many cases one cannot objectively define a single \"right\" rhythmic pattern for a given song section. To create a dataset with well-defined ground-truth labels, we asked expert musicians to transcribe the rhythmic patterns in 410 popular songs and record cover versions where the guitar tracks followed those transcriptions. To transcribe the strums and their corresponding rhythmic patterns, we propose a three-step framework.

Secondly, we detect individual strums within the separated guitar audio, using a pre-trained foundation model (MERT) as a backbone. Finally, we carry out a pattern-decoding process in which the transcribed sequence of guitar strums is represented by patterns drawn from an expert-curated vocabulary. We show that it is possible to transcribe the rhythmic patterns of the guitar track in polyphonic music with quite high accuracy, producing a representation that is human-readable and includes automatically detected bar lines and time signature markers.

To achieve this and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity, efficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine Shapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two novel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to interpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of higher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of the null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements and flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with vanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The latter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of hierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply a unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical properties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the projection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion algebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain previously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new perspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph structured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up the possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine learning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many more."}

Moreover, StereoSync also achieves efficiency by leveraging pretrained foundation models, reducing the need for extensive training while maintaining high-quality synthesis. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on temporal synchronization, StereoSync introduces a significant advancement by incorporating spatial awareness into video-aligned audio generation. Indeed, given an input video, our approach extracts spatial cues from depth maps and bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based audio generation model. Such an approach allows StereoSync to go beyond simple synchronization, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to the spatial structure and movement of a video scene. We evaluate StereoSync on Walking The Maps, a curated dataset comprising videos from video games that feature animated characters walking through diverse environments.

Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets.

In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000 images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects.

Prior works in dialogue systems have shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and task-oriented dialogue.

For this we extend the traditional notion of empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further advancing the field of RL."}

Empirical results demonstrated that the classical MLP achieved near-optimal policy convergence with a mean return of 498.7 +/- 3.2, maintaining stable equilibrium throughout training. In contrast, the VQC exhibited limited learning capability, with an average return of 14.6 +/- 4.8, primarily constrained by circuit depth and qubit connectivity. Noise robustness analysis further revealed that the MLP policy deteriorated gracefully under Gaussian perturbations, while the VQC displayed higher sensitivity at equivalent noise levels. Despite the lower asymptotic performance, the VQC exhibited significantly lower parameter count and marginally increased training time, highlighting its potential scalability for low-resource quantum processors.

The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions.

In both cases, the algorithm is able to find parameters which result in reduced errors in the climatology of the model. Finally, we introduce a novel approach which combines both methods called adaptive supermodeling, where the internal parameters of the members of a supermodel are tuned simultaneously with the model weights such that the supermodel predictions are optimized.

These models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference, and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under data-controlled training, while also improving text performance.

Although numerous methods for detecting and mitigating backdoor attacks have been proposed, most rely on identifying and eliminating the ``shortcut\" created by the backdoor, which links a specific source class to a target class. However, these approaches can be easily circumvented by designing multiple backdoor triggers that create shortcuts everywhere and therefore nowhere specific. In this study, we explore the concept of Multi-Trigger Backdoor Attacks (MTBAs), where multiple adversaries leverage different types of triggers to poison the same dataset. By proposing and investigating three types of multi-trigger attacks including \\textit{parallel}, \\textit{sequential}, and \\textit{hybrid} attacks, we demonstrate that 1) multiple triggers can coexist, overwrite, or cross-activate one another, and 2) MTBAs easily break the prevalent shortcut assumption underlying most existing backdoor detection/removal methods, rendering them ineffective.

The complainant-comparator pair is central to discrimination testing. Most discrimination testing tools rely on this pair to establish evidence for discrimination. In this work we revisit the role of the comparator in discrimination testing. We first argue for the inherent causal modeling nature of deriving the comparator. We then introduce a two-kinds classification for the comparator: the ceteris paribus, or``with all else equal,'' (CP) comparator and the mutatis mutandis, or ``with the appropriate adjustments being made,'' (MM) comparator. The CP comparator is the standard comparator, representing an idealized comparison for establishing discrimination as it aims for a complainant-comparator pair that only differs on membership to the protected attribute. As an alternative to it, we define the MM comparator, which requires that the comparator represents the``what would have been of'' the complainant without the effects of the protected attribute on the non-protected attributes. Under the MM comparator, the complainant-comparator pair can be dissimilar in terms of the non-protected attributes, departing from an idealized comparison. Notably, the MM comparator is a more complex kind of comparator and its implementation offers an impactful venue for machine learning methods. We illustrate these two comparators and their impact on discrimination testing using a real-world example."}

Golam Rabiul Alam", "title": "DUA-D2C: Dynamic Uncertainty Aware Method for Overfitting Remediation in Deep Learning", "abstract": "Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each. This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set, considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods, establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating overfitting in modern deep learning.

We evaluated these models on their ability to learn from experience, adapt, and gather information. First, in \"Feature World,\" a simple setting for testing information gathering, models performed near-optimally. However, to test more complex, multi-trial learning, we implemented a text-based version of the \"Alchemy\" environment, a benchmark for meta-learning. Here, agents must deduce a latent causal structure by integrating information across many trials. In this setting, recent foundation models initially failed to improve their performance over time. Crucially, we found that prompting the models to summarize their observations at regular intervals enabled an emergent meta-learning process. This allowed them to improve across trials and even adaptively re-learn when the environment's rules changed unexpectedly. While most models handled the simple task, Alchemy revealed stark differences in robustness: Gemini 2.5 performed best, followed by Claude 3.7, while ChatGPT-4o and o4-mini struggled. This underscores Alchemy's value as a benchmark. Our findings demonstrate that the biggest challenge for foundation models is not selecting informative actions in the moment, but integrating knowledge through adaptive strategies over time.

However, the reliability of these verifiers and their impact on the RL training process remain poorly understood. In this work, we take mathematical reasoning as a case study and conduct a comprehensive analysis of various verifiers in both static evaluation and RL training scenarios. First, we find that current open-source rule-based verifiers often fail to recognize equivalent answers presented in different formats across multiple commonly used mathematical datasets, resulting in non-negligible false negative rates. This limitation adversely affects RL training performance and becomes more pronounced as the policy model gets stronger. Subsequently, we investigate model-based verifiers as a potential solution to address these limitations. While the static evaluation shows that model-based verifiers achieve significantly higher verification accuracy, further analysis and RL results imply that they are highly susceptible to hacking, where they misclassify certain patterns in responses as correct, particularly after fine-tuning.

MTL assumes tasks share similarities that can improve performance. In addition, boosting algorithms have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse learning problems, primarily due to their ability to focus on hard-to-learn instances and iteratively reduce residual errors. This makes them a promising approach for learning multi-task problems. However, real-world MTL scenarios often involve tasks that are not well-aligned (known as outlier or adversarial tasks), which do not share beneficial similarities with others and can, in fact, deteriorate the performance of the overall model. To overcome this challenge, we propose Robust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting (R-MTGB), a novel boosting framework that explicitly models and adapts to task heterogeneity during training. R-MTGB structures the learning process into three sequential blocks: (1) learning shared patterns, (2) partitioning tasks into outliers and non-outliers with regularized parameters, and (3) fine-tuning task-specific predictors. This architecture enables R-MTGB to automatically detect and penalize outlier tasks while promoting effective knowledge transfer among related tasks. Our method integrates these mechanisms seamlessly within gradient boosting, allowing robust handling of noisy or adversarial tasks without sacrificing accuracy.

Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards.

However, scalar feedback is often noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of learned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time scalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for continual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal inconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering ambiguous feedback. Pref-GUIDE Voting further enhances robustness by aggregating reward models across a population of users to form consensus preferences. Across three challenging environments, Pref-GUIDE significantly outperforms scalar-feedback baselines, with the voting variant exceeding even expert-designed dense rewards. By reframing scalar feedback as structured preferences with population feedback, Pref-GUIDE offers a scalable and principled approach for harnessing human input in online reinforcement learning."}

To this end, we propose a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS, for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on message monitoring.

We consistently observe across 6 state-of-the-art text encoders and 26 downstream tasks, that randomly removing up to 50% of embedding dimensions results in only a minor drop in performance, less than 10%, in retrieval and classification tasks. Given the benefits of using smaller-sized embeddings, as well as the potential insights about text encoding, we study this phenomenon and find that, contrary to what is suggested in prior work, this is not the result of an ineffective use of representation space. Instead, we find that a large number of uniformly distributed dimensions actually cause an increase in performance when removed. This would explain why, on average, removing a large number of embedding dimensions results in a marginal drop in performance. We make similar observations when truncating the embeddings used by large language models to make next-token predictions on generative tasks, suggesting that this phenomenon is not isolated to classification or retrieval tasks."}

This paper presents an enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors (EKNN) classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers.

In this paper, we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the bundle pricing problem.

In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance."}

To address this, we introduce SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48% compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are statistically significant.

Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive, transparent report.

A standard setting when performing distributed learning tasks is that clients agree on a shared setup, i.e., find a compromise from a set of hyperparameters, like the learning rate of the model to be trained. Yet, prior work on differentially private hyperparameter tuning either uses computationally expensive cryptographic protocols, determines hyperparameters separately for each client, or applies differential privacy locally, which can lead to undesirable utility-privacy trade-offs.In this work, we present our algorithm DP-HYPE, which performs a distributed and privacy-preserving hyperparameter search by conducting a distributed voting based on local hyperparameter evaluations of clients. In this way, DP-HYPE selects hyperparameters that lead to a compromise supported by the majority of clients, while maintaining scalability and independence from specific learning tasks. We prove that DP-HYPE preserves the strong notion of differential privacy called client-level differential privacy and, importantly, show that its privacy guarantees do not depend on the number of hyperparameters. We also provide bounds on its utility guarantees, that is, the probability of reaching a compromise, and implement DP-HYPE as a submodule in the popular Flower framework for distributed machine learning.

Moreover, the IPO method can achieve a super-linear convergence rate once it enters a local region around the optimal policy. Finally, when the optimal policy for an RL problem with a known environment is appropriately transferred as the initial policy to an RL problem with an unknown environment, the IPO method is shown to enable a super-linear convergence rate if the two environments are sufficiently close.

We argue that a foundational step towards a more disciplined engineering practice is a systematic understanding of the core functional units--generative transformations--and their compositional patterns within LLM-native applications.Focusing on the rich domain of software verification and falsification, we conduct a secondary study of over 100 research proposals to address this gap. We first present a fine-grained taxonomy of generative transformations, abstracting prompt-based interactions into conceptual signatures. This taxonomy serves as a scaffolding to identify recurrent transformation relationship patterns--analogous to software design patterns--that characterize solution approaches in the literature. Our analysis not only validates the utility of the taxonomy but also surfaces strategic gaps and cross-dimensional relationships, offering a structured foundation for future research in modular and compositional LLM application design, benchmarking, and the development of reliable LLM-native systems."}

Recently, solving diffusion models in the latent space through an encoder that maps from the data space to a lower-dimensional latent space has been considered to make the training process more efficient and has shown state-of-the-art results. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is the most commonly used encoder/decoder framework in this domain, known for its ability to learn latent representations and generate data samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel encoder/decoder framework with theoretical properties distinct from those of the VAE, specifically designed to preserve the geometric structure of the data distribution.

Sudoso", "title": "Strong bounds for large-scale Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering", "abstract": "Clustering is a fundamental technique in data analysis and machine learning, used to group similar data points together. Among various clustering methods, the Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering (MSSC) is one of the most widely used. MSSC aims to minimize the total squared Euclidean distance between data points and their corresponding cluster centroids. Due to the unsupervised nature of clustering, achieving global optimality is crucial, yet computationally challenging. The complexity of finding the global solution increases exponentially with the number of data points, making exact methods impractical for large-scale datasets. Even obtaining strong lower bounds on the optimal MSSC objective value is computationally prohibitive, making it difficult to assess the quality of heuristic solutions. We address this challenge by introducing a novel method to validate heuristic MSSC solutions through optimality gaps. Our approach employs a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing the problem into smaller instances that can be handled by an exact solver. The decomposition is guided by an auxiliary optimization problem, the \"anticlustering problem\", for which we design an efficient heuristic. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for large-scale instances, achieving optimality gaps below 3% in most cases while maintaining reasonable computational times. These results highlight the practicality of our approach in assessing feasible clustering solutions for large datasets, bridging a critical gap in MSSC evaluation."}

However, such distribution shifts are often brittle and degrade performance on desirable tasks. To address these pitfalls, we propose augmenting the model's vocabulary with a special red flag token, and training the model to insert this token whenever harmful content is generated or imminent. This approach enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness in its representations, with minimal impact on utility due to the marginal change in the generated distribution of natural language. Moreover, because the token is embedded in the model's vocabulary, we can naturally leverage the LLMs' generalization capabilities, such as in-context learning (ICL) and out-of-distribution generalization to languages that are not formally supported (e.g., Japanese for Llama3). In particular, we demonstrate that through ICL alone, the model can learn to initiate reflective reasoning upon generating the red flag token at inference, which steers the response away from harmful continuations or enables self-correction when the flag is raised falsely. This approach is orthogonal and complementary to existing safety technique (such as safety classifiers or standard safety training) and easier to evaluate in comparison to natural language refusals, as it does not require a human or automated judge to assess the harmlessness of the answers."}

Peer effect refers to the difference in counterfactual outcomes of an individual for different levels of peer exposure, the extent to which an individual is exposed to the treatments, actions, or behaviors of peers. Estimating peer effects requires deciding how to represent peer exposure. Typically, researchers define an exposure mapping function that aggregates peer treatments and outputs peer exposure. Most existing approaches for defining exposure mapping functions assume peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers. Recent studies have investigated more complex functions of peer exposure which capture that different peers can exert different degrees of influence. However, none of these works have explicitly considered the problem of automatically learning the exposure mapping function. In this work, we focus on learning this function for the purpose of estimating heterogeneous peer effects, where heterogeneity refers to the variation in counterfactual outcomes for the same peer exposure but different individual's contexts. We develop EgoNetGNN, a graph neural network (GNN)-based method, to automatically learn the appropriate exposure mapping function allowing for complex peer influence mechanisms that, in addition to peer treatments, can involve the local neighborhood structure and edge attributes. We show that GNN models that use peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers or learn peer exposure naively face difficulty accounting for such influence mechanisms. Our comprehensive evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network data shows that our method is more robust to different unknown underlying influence mechanisms when estimating heterogeneous peer effects when compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

In this paper, we propose IMPACT, a novel motion planning framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer environment semantics, identifying which parts of the environment can best tolerate contact based on object properties and locations. Our approach generates an anisotropic cost map that encodes directional push safety. We pair this map with a contact-aware A* planner to find stable contact-rich paths. We perform experiments using 20 simulation and 10 real-world scenes and assess using task success rate, object displacements, and feedback from human evaluators.

Specifically, we construct a transport plan between brain voxel embeddings and image embeddings, enabling more precise matching. By controlling the amount of transport, we mitigate the influence of redundant information.

As a first step, we propose an algorithm to generate fast and reproducible probability maps of the skeleton, adjacent internal organs (liver, spleen, urinary bladder, and kidneys), and spinal canal. Methods: We developed an automated deep-learning pipeline based on a 3D patch-based Residual U-Net architecture that localises and delineates these anatomical structures on WB-DWI. The algorithm was trained using \"soft labels\" (non-binary segmentations) derived from a computationally intensive atlas-based approach. For training and validation, we employed a multi-centre WB-DWI dataset comprising 532 scans from patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer (APC) or Multiple Myeloma (MM), with testing on 45 patients. Results: Our weakly-supervised deep learning model achieved an average dice score of 0.67 for whole skeletal delineation, 0.76 when excluding ribcage, 0.83 for internal organs, and 0.86 for spinal canal, with average surface distances below 3mm. Relative median ADC differences between automated and manual full-body delineations were below 10%. The model was 12x faster than the atlas-based registration algorithm (25 sec vs. 5 min). Two experienced radiologists rated the model's outputs as either \"good\" or \"excellent\" on test scans, with inter-reader agreement from fair to substantial (Gwet's AC1 = 0.27-0.72).

Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference.

Please cite the published version.Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints.

However, these financial documents present significant analytical challenges, typically containing over 5,000 words with substantial redundancy and industry-specific terminology that creates obstacles for language models. In this work, we propose the SAE-FiRE (Sparse Autoencoder for Financial Representation Enhancement) framework to address these limitations by extracting key information while eliminating redundancy. SAE-FiRE employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose dense neural representations from large language models into interpretable sparse components, then applies statistical feature selection methods, including ANOVA F-tests and tree-based importance scoring, to identify the top-k most discriminative dimensions for classification. By systematically filtering out noise that might otherwise lead to overfitting, we enable more robust and generalizable predictions. Experimental results across three financial datasets demonstrate that SAE-FiRE significantly outperforms baseline approaches."}

We construct an extended-refusal dataset in which responses to harmful prompts provide detailed justifications before refusing, distributing the refusal signal across multiple token positions. Fine-tuning Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen2.5-Instruct (1.5B and 3B parameters) on this dataset yields models that maintain high refusal rates under abliteration: refusal rates drop by at most 10%, compared to 70-80% drops in baseline models.

Towards Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models", "abstract": "Reasoning language models improve performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs), but this process can also increase harmful outputs in adversarial settings. In this work, we ask whether the long CoTs can be leveraged for predictive safety monitoring: do the reasoning traces provide early signals of final response alignment that could enable timely intervention? We evaluate a range of monitoring methods using either CoT text or activations, including highly capable large language models, fine-tuned classifiers, and humans. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations significantly outperforms all text-based baselines in predicting whether a final response is safe or unsafe, with an average absolute increase of 13 in F1 scores over the best-performing alternatives. CoT texts are often unfaithful and misleading, while model latents provide a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe can be applied to early CoT segments before the response is generated, showing that alignment signals appear before reasoning completes. Error analysis reveals that the performance gap between text classifiers and the linear probe largely stems from a subset of responses we call performative CoTs, where the reasoning consistently contradicts the final response as the CoT progresses. Our findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation."}

While effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention effectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models, enhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their social and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather conditions.

Because soil N has high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm, and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in vineyards."}

Our analysis uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.

Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging from 20% to 60%.

We also offer an alternative compelling interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code.

Angle encoding has emerged as a popular choice as feature map (FM) for embedding classical data into quantum models due to its simplicity and natural generation of truncated Fourier series, providing universal function approximation capabilities. Efficient FMs within quantum circuits can exploit exponential scaling of Fourier frequencies, with multi-dimensional inputs introducing additional exponential growth through mixed-frequency terms. Despite this promising expressive capability, practical implementation faces significant challenges. Through controlled experiments with white-box target functions, we demonstrate that training failures can occur even when all relevant frequencies are theoretically accessible. We illustrate how two primary known causes lead to unsuccessful optimization: insufficient trainable parameters relative to the model's frequency content, and limitations imposed by the ansatz's dynamic lie algebra dimension, but also uncover an additional parameter burden: the necessity of controlling non-unique frequencies within the model. To address this, we propose near-zero weight initialization to suppress unnecessary duplicate frequencies. For target functions with a priori frequency knowledge, we introduce frequency selection as a practical solution that reduces parameter requirements and mitigates the exponential growth that would otherwise render problems intractable due to parameter insufficiency. Our frequency selection approach achieved near-optimal performance (median $R^2 \\approx 0.95$) with 78\\% of the parameters needed by the best standard approach in 10 randomly chosen target functions."}

This shift to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the models ineffective. While the causes of model collapse are increasingly understood, effective mitigation strategies remain scarce. We address this challenge by leveraging a key insight: auto-regressive models tend to generate text sequences to which they assign high confidence (i.e., high log-likelihood). Based on this observation, we introduce the Truncated-Cross-Entropy (TCE) loss function. TCE mitigates collapse by selectively ignoring high-confidence tokens during training, effectively filtering out likely machine-generated artifacts from the learning process. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with TCE not only learn effectively but also exhibit significantly increased resilience, tolerating over 2.3x more synthetic data before the onset of collapse. In addition, we provide an open-source benchmark for collapse dynamics in mixed-data settings. Our results demonstrate that confidence-aware training objectives can substantially delay collapse onset, offering a practical and generalizable tool for model robustness under synthetic-data exposure."}

Detectors trained on OpenFake achieve near-perfect in-distribution performance, strong generalization to unseen generators, and high accuracy on a curated in-the-wild social media test set, significantly outperforming models trained on existing datasets. Overall, we demonstrate that with high-quality and continually updated benchmarks, automatic deepfake detection is both feasible and effective in real-world settings."}

By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs).

While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity, they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout of size $N \\times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of variable-length English sentences.

Rather than directly parameterizing controls, which does not leverage the Hamiltonian's underlying structure, we propose an end-to-end implicit deep learning approach that directly parameterizes the value function to learn optimal control laws.

Baraniuk", "title": "Neon: Negative Extrapolation From Self-Training Improves Image Generation", "abstract": "Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute. Code is available atthis https URL"}

However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution. Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions. Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples. Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to $\\textbf{15.97\\%}$ in accuracy.

To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context.

However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are often woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This makes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences in isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard models are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the domain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address this, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a transformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core components: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the linguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating sentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class Overlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the coexistence of themes in a single sentence. Our results show that by making the model explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a strong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable improvements across all themes. This work provides a robust and generalizable methodology for any text classification task in which meaning depends on the context of the narrative."}

We introduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees for LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and verifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive validation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise safety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and subjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance with these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it is deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action monitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each proposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This separation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online monitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a robust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents."}

However, critical evidence highlights challenges with fully remote arrangements, particularly for software teams. This study investigates employee resignation patterns at Ericsson, a global developer of software-intensive systems, before, during, and after the pandemic. Using HR data from 2016-2025 in Ericsson Sweden, we analyze how different work modalities (onsite, remote, and hybrid) influence employee retention. Our findings show a marked increase in resignations from summer 2021 to summer 2023, especially among employees with less than five years of tenure. Employees onboarded remotely during the pandemic were significantly more likely to resign within their first three years, even after returning to the office. Exit surveys suggest that remote onboarding may fail to establish the necessary organizational attachment, the feeling of belonging and long-term retention. By contrast, the company's eventual successful return to pre-pandemic retention rates illustrates the value of differentiated work policies and supports reconsidering selective return-to-office (RTO) mandates. Our study demonstrates the importance of employee integration practices in hybrid environments where the requirement for in-office presence for recent hires shall be accompanied by in-office presence from their team members and more senior staff whose mentoring and social interactions contribute to integration into the corporate work environment. We hope these actionable insights will inform HR leaders and policymakers in shaping post-pandemic work practices, demonstrating that carefully crafted hybrid models anchored in organizational attachment and mentorship can sustain retention in knowledge-intensive companies."}

Static analysis and defect-prediction tools produce metrics (e.g., complexity,coupling) that flag potentially fault-prone components, but these signals are often hard for contributors new or unfamiliar with the codebase to interpret. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on software engineering tasks such as code summarization and documentation generation. Building on this progress, we investigate whether LLMs can translate fault-prediction metrics into clear, human-readable risk explanations and actionable guidance to help OSS contributors plan and review code modifications.

By analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence, especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains.

Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data, they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2) Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM training.

In fact, they involve a large number of heterogeneous microservices that also include third-party software. As a result, security vulnerabilities are hard to identify and mitigate before they start being actively exploited by attackers. For this reason, governments have recently introduced cybersecurity regulations that require vendors to share a software bill of material (SBOM) with end users or regulators. An SBOM can be employed to identify the security vulnerabilities of a software component even without access to its source code, as long as it is accurate and interoperable across different tools. This work evaluates this issue through a comprehensive study of tools for SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning, including both open-source software and cloud services from major providers. We specifically target software containers and focus on operating system packages in Linux distributions that are widely used as base images due to their far-reaching security impact. Our findings show that the considered tools are largely incompatible, leading to inaccurate reporting and a large amount of undetected vulnerabilities. We uncover the SBOM confusion vulnerability, a byproduct of such fragmented ecosystem, where inconsistent formats prevent reliable vulnerability detection across tools."}

For each class, we propose a potential rewrite and discuss the conditions under which it is advantageous. Next, we address the evaluation aspects of the proposed rewrites: 1) we describe our approach to adapting the block-based Volcano query processing model, and 2) we discuss the benefits of implementing that technique within a position-enabled column-store with late materialization support. Finally, we present a simple cost model that allows estimation of the benefits of said rewrites.Our evaluation has a quantitative part and a qualitative part. The former focuses on studying the impact of non-correlated predicate selectivity on our technique. The latter identifies the limitations of our approach by comparing it with alternative approaches available in existing systems. Overall, experiments conducted using PosDB (a position-enabled column-store) and PostgreSQL demonstrated that, under suitable conditions, our technique can achieve a 5x improvement."}

We argue that a foundational step towards a more disciplined engineering practice is a systematic understanding of the core functional units--generative transformations--and their compositional patterns within LLM-native applications.Focusing on the rich domain of software verification and falsification, we conduct a secondary study of over 100 research proposals to address this gap. We first present a fine-grained taxonomy of generative transformations, abstracting prompt-based interactions into conceptual signatures. This taxonomy serves as a scaffolding to identify recurrent transformation relationship patterns--analogous to software design patterns--that characterize solution approaches in the literature. Our analysis not only validates the utility of the taxonomy but also surfaces strategic gaps and cross-dimensional relationships, offering a structured foundation for future research in modular and compositional LLM application design, benchmarking, and the development of reliable LLM-native systems."}

In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based approach for context-aware visual change detection in software test automation. Our method leverages a machine learning model (YOLOv5) to detect UI controls from software screenshots and constructs a graph that models their contextual and spatial relationships. This graph structure is then used to identify correspondences between UI elements across software versions and to detect meaningful changes. The proposed method incorporates a recursive similarity computation that combines structural, visual, and textual cues, offering a robust and holistic model of UI changes. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of real-world software screenshots and demonstrate that it reliably detects both simple and complex UI changes. Our method significantly outperforms pixel-wise and region-based baselines, especially in scenarios requiring contextual understanding. We also discuss current limitations related to dataset diversity, baseline complexity, and model generalization, and outline planned future improvements.

Hence, practitioners often rely on intuition and past experiences from similar systems to address uncertainties. In this article, we evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in enabling a systematic and automated approach to identify uncertainties in self-adaptive robotics throughout the software engineering lifecycle. For this evaluation, we analyzed 10 advanced LLMs with varying capabilities across four industrial-sized robotics case studies, gathering the practitioners' perspectives on the LLM-generated responses related to uncertainties. Results showed that practitioners agreed with 63-88% of the LLM responses and expressed strong interest in the practicality of LLMs for this purpose."}

This instability makes it difficult to reliably build LLM applications. Moreover, simply specifying all requirements does not consistently help, as models have limited instruction-following ability and requirements can conflict. Standard prompt optimizers likewise provide little benefit. To address these issues, we propose requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that improve performance by 4.8% on average over baselines. We further advocate for a systematic process of proactive requirements discovery, evaluation, and monitoring to better manage prompt underspecification in practice."}

Umer Ashfaq,Wajahat Hussain", "title": "Data and Context Matter: Towards Generalizing AI-based Software Vulnerability Detection", "abstract": "AI-based solutions demonstrate remarkable results in identifying vulnerabilities in software, but research has consistently found that this performance does not generalize to unseen codebases. In this paper, we specifically investigate the impact of model architecture, parameter configuration, and quality of training data on the ability of these systems to generalize.For this purpose, we introduce VulGate, a high quality state of the art dataset that mitigates the shortcomings of prior datasets, by removing mislabeled and duplicate samples, updating new vulnerabilities, incorporating additional metadata, integrating hard samples, and including dedicated test sets. We undertake a series of experiments to demonstrate that improved dataset diversity and quality substantially enhances vulnerability detection. We also introduce and benchmark multiple encoder-only and decoder-only models. We find that encoder-based models outperform other models in terms of accuracy and generalization. Our model achieves \\textbf{6.8\\%} improvement in recall on the benchmark BigVul dataset and outperforms others on unseen projects, demonstrating enhanced generalizability. Our results highlight the role of data quality and model selection in the development of robust vulnerability detection systems. Our findings suggest a direction for future systems with high cross-project effectiveness."}

If so, it will enable rapid prototyping of new programming languages and language features. We study this question using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via small-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational semantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written, LLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by code-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes. Given a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are evaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state prediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction. To distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two nonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard rules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard semantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that (i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models perform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about highly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and surprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but often hurts on more complex ones. Overall, the results show a promise that LLMs could serve as programming language interpreters, but points to the lack of their robust semantics understanding. We release the benchmark and the supporting code atthis https URL."}
