The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation (\"boxes\"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a \"consistent group\", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem."}

The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training."}

Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE).

Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading."}

This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning."}

Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities.

However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents."}

A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states."}

Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%).

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design.

By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier.

AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks.

Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis."}

Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy.

This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment."}

While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks."}

In this work, we investigate the impact of \\emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model, evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection.

Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average.

Most existing selection bias metrics require answer labels and measure divergences between prediction and answer distributions, but do not fully capture the consistency of a model's predictions across different orderings of answer choices. Existing selection bias mitigation strategies have notable limitations: majority voting, though effective, is computationally prohibitive; calibration-based methods require validation sets and often fail to generalize across datasets. To address these gaps, we propose three key contributions: (1) a new unsupervised label-free Permutation Bias Metric (PBM) that directly quantifies inconsistencies in model predictions across answer permutations, providing a more precise measure of selection bias, (2) an efficient majority voting approach called Batch Question-Context KV caching (BaQCKV), to significantly reduce computational costs while preserving bias mitigation effectiveness, and (3) an unsupervised Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-1) fine-tuning strategy based on our proposed metric and the BaQCKV that mitigates selection bias, providing a computationally efficient alternative that maintains model generalizability.

In the second test, also performed using ChatGPT and Gemini, we instead identify the presence of 'Bose-Einstein statistics', rather than the intuitively expected 'Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics', in the distribution of the words contained in large-size texts.

Although producing humor requires complex cognitive reasoning and social understanding, theories of humor suggest that it follows learnable patterns and structures, making it theoretically possible for generative models to acquire them implicitly. In recent years, multimodal humor has become a prevalent form of online communication, especially among Gen Z, highlighting the need for AI systems capable of integrating visual understanding with humorous language generation. However, existing data-driven approaches lack explicit modeling or theoretical grounding of humor, often producing literal descriptions that fail to capture its underlying cognitive mechanisms, resulting in the generated image descriptions that are fluent but lack genuine humor or cognitive depth. To address this limitation, we propose HUMORCHAIN (HUmor-guided Multi-step Orchestrated Reasoning Chain for Image Captioning), a theory-guided multi-stage reasoning framework. It integrates visual semantic parsing, humor- and psychology-based reasoning, and a fine-tuned discriminator for humor evaluation, forming an interpretable and controllable cognitive reasoning chain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly embed cognitive structures from humor theories into multimodal humor generation, enabling a structured reasoning process from visual understanding to humor creation. Experiments on Meme-Image-No-Text, Oogiri-GO, and OxfordTVG-HIC datasets show that HUMORCHAIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in human humor preference, Elo/BT scores, and semantic diversity, demonstrating that theory-driven structured reasoning enables large language models to generate humor aligned with human perception."}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a solution, but current approaches typically ignore the distinct roles of model components and the heterogeneous importance across layers, thereby limiting adaptation efficiency. Motivated by the observation that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) induce critical activations in the low-frequency dimensions of attention states, we propose RoPE-aware Selective Adaptation (RoSA), a novel PEFT framework that allocates trainable parameters in a more targeted and effective manner. RoSA comprises a RoPE-aware Attention Enhancement (RoAE) module, which selectively enhances the low-frequency components of RoPE-influenced attention states, and a Dynamic Layer Selection (DLS) strategy that adaptively identifies and updates the most critical layers based on LayerNorm gradient norms. By combining dimension-wise enhancement with layer-wise adaptation, RoSA achieves more targeted and efficient fine-tuning.

A novel L&T-specific metrics framework was developed to assess accuracy in reporting attributes such as type, longitudinal change and placement. A first-of-its-kind retrospective user evaluation study was conducted with nine radiologists of varying experience, who blindly reviewed 600 studies from distinct subjects.

In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection."}

Situation awareness about such disaster impacts generated by authoritative data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, and/or geographic data is often limited due to atmospheric opacity, satellite revisits, and time limitations. This often results in geo-temporal information gaps. In contrast, impact-related social media posts can act as \"geo-sensors\" during a disaster, where people describe specific impacts and locations. However, not all locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts relate to an impact. Only the impacted locations are critical for directing resources effectively. e.g., \"The death toll from a fire which ripped through the Greek coastal town of #Mati stood at 80, with dozens of people unaccounted for as forensic experts tried to identify victims who were burned alive #Greecefires #AthensFires #Athens #Greece.\" contains impacted location \"Mati\" and non-impacted locations \"Greece\" and \"Athens\". This research uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify all locations, impacts and impacted locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts. In the process, LLMs are fine-tuned to identify only impacts and impacted locations (as distinct from other, non-impacted locations), including locations mentioned in informal expressions, abbreviations, and short forms. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates efficacy, achieving an F1-score of 0.69 for impact and 0.74 for impacted location extraction, substantially outperforming the pre-trained baseline. These robust results confirm the potential of fine-tuned language models to offer a scalable solution for timely decision-making in resource allocation, situational awareness, and post-disaster recovery planning for responders."}

The central limitation of current risk analysis is the inability to populate the $\\textit{catastrophic event space}$, or the set of potential large-scale harms to which probabilities might be assigned. This intractability is worsened by the $\\textit{Lucretius problem}$, or the tendency to infer future risks only from past experience. We propose a process of $\\textit{dark speculation}$, in which systematically generating and refining catastrophic scenarios (\"qualitative\" work) is coupled with estimating their likelihoods and associated damages (quantitative underwriting analysis). The idea is neither to predict the future nor to enable insurance for its own sake, but to use narrative and underwriting tools together to generate probability distributions over outcomes. We formalize this process using a simplified catastrophic Lévy stochastic framework and propose an iterative institutional design in which (1) speculation (including scenario planning) generates detailed catastrophic event narratives, (2) insurance underwriters assign probabilistic and financial parameters to these narratives, and (3) decision-makers synthesize the results into summary statistics to inform judgment. Analysis of the model reveals the value of (a) maintaining independence between speculation and underwriting, (b) analyzing multiple risk categories in parallel, and (c) generating \"thick\" catastrophic narrative rich in causal (counterfactual) and mitigative detail. While the approach cannot eliminate deep ambiguity, it offers a systematic approach to reason about extreme, low-probability events in frontier AI, tempering complacency and overreaction.

However, despite the growing use of LLMs in review systems, their capabilities to pinpoint errors remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fault Localization Across Writing in Science (FLAWS), an automated benchmark consisting of 713 paper-error pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs detect errors that undermine key claims in research papers. We construct the benchmark by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs, paired with an automated evaluation metric that measures whether models can identify and localize these errors. Developing such a benchmark presents unique challenges that we overcome: ensuring that the inserted errors are well-defined, challenging, and relevant to the content of the paper, avoiding artifacts that would make identification trivial, and designing a scalable, automated evaluation metric. On the resulting benchmark, we evaluate five frontier LLMs: Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek Reasoner v3.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 5, and Grok 4.

We propose LILAD (Learning In-Context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics), a novel framework for system identification that jointly guarantees adaptability and stability. LILAD simultaneously learns a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function through in-context learning (ICL), explicitly accounting for parametric uncertainty. Trained across a diverse set of tasks, LILAD produces a stability-aware, adaptive dynamics model alongside an adaptive Lyapunov certificate. At test time, both components adapt to a new system instance using a short trajectory prompt, which enables fast generalization. To rigorously ensure stability, LILAD also computes a state-dependent attenuator that enforces a sufficient decrease condition on the Lyapunov function for any state in the new system instance. This mechanism extends stability guarantees even under out-of-distribution and out-of-task scenarios. We evaluate LILAD on benchmark autonomous systems and demonstrate that it outperforms adaptive, robust, and non-adaptive baselines in predictive accuracy."}

This disciplinary disconnect prevents the accurate translation of technical vulnerabilities into financial liability, leaving practitioners unable to answer fundamental economic questions regarding contingency reserves, control return-on-investment, and insurance exposure. To bridge this gap, this research presents the AI System Threat Vector Taxonomy, a structured ontology designed explicitly for Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA).

Uniquely, each domain maps technical vectors directly to business loss categories (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Legal, Reputation), enabling the translation of abstract threats into measurable financial impact.

Despite the advancements in deep learning, feature transformation remains essential for structured data, where deep models often struggle to capture complex feature interactions. Prior literature on automated feature transformation has achieved success but often relies on heuristics or exhaustive searches, leading to inefficient and time-consuming processes. Recent works employ reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance traditional approaches through a more effective trial-and-error way. However, two limitations remain: 1) Dynamic feature expansion during the transformation process, which causes instability and increases the learning complexity for RL agents; 2) Insufficient cooperation and communication between agents, which results in suboptimal feature crossing operations and degraded model performance. To address them, we propose a novel heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework to enable cooperative and scalable feature transformation. The framework comprises three heterogeneous agents, grouped into two types, each designed to select essential features and operations for feature crossing. To enhance communication among these agents, we implement a shared critic mechanism that facilitates information exchange during feature transformation. To handle the dynamically expanding feature space, we tailor multi-head attention-based feature agents to select suitable features for feature crossing. Additionally, we introduce a state encoding technique during the optimization process to stabilize and enhance the learning dynamics of the RL agents, resulting in more robust and reliable transformation policies.

Richard Kuhn", "title": "ABLE: Using Adversarial Pairs to Construct Local Models for Explaining Model Predictions", "abstract": "Machine learning models are increasingly used in critical applications but are mostly \"black boxes\" due to their lack of transparency. Local explanation approaches, such as LIME, address this issue by approximating the behavior of complex models near a test instance using simple, interpretable models. However, these approaches often suffer from instability and poor local fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adversarially Bracketed Local Explanation (ABLE) to address these limitations. Our approach first generates a set of neighborhood points near the test instance, x_test, by adding bounded Gaussian noise. For each neighborhood point D, we apply an adversarial attack to generate an adversarial point A with minimal perturbation that results in a different label than D. A second adversarial attack is then performed on A to generate a point A' that has the same label as D (and thus different than A). The points A and A' form an adversarial pair that brackets the local decision boundary for x_test. We then train a linear model on these adversarial pairs to approximate the local decision boundary. Experimental results on six UCI benchmark datasets across three deep neural network architectures demonstrate that our approach achieves higher stability and fidelity than the state-of-the-art."}

This research presents a comprehensive financial framework for quantifying AI project returns that explicitly integrates changes in organizational risk profiles. The methodology addresses a critical gap in current practice where investment decisions rely on optimistic benefit projections without accounting for the probabilistic costs of AI-specific threats including model drift, bias-related litigation, and compliance failures under emerging regulations such as the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act and ISO/IEC 42001. Drawing on established risk quantification methods, including annual loss expectancy calculations and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, this framework enables practitioners to compute net benefits that incorporate both productivity gains and the delta between pre-implementation and post-implementation risk exposures. The analysis demonstrates that accurate AI investment evaluation requires explicit modeling of control effectiveness, reserve requirements for algorithmic failures, and the ongoing operational costs of maintaining model performance. Practical implications include specific guidance for establishing governance structures, conducting phased validations, and integrating risk-adjusted metrics into capital allocation decisions, ultimately enabling evidence-based AI portfolio management that satisfies both fiduciary responsibilities and regulatory mandates."}

We contend that safety and security are not merely fixed attributes of individual models but also emergent properties arising from the dynamic interactions among models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating environments. We propose a new way of identification of novel agentic risks through the lens of user safety. Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows. This risk discovery phase finds novel agentic risks that are then contextually mitigated. We also release the dataset from our case study, containing traces of over 10,000 realistic attack and defense executions of the agentic workflow to help advance research in agentic safety."}

A Systematic Evaluation Across Retinal Imaging Tasks", "abstract": "Large vision foundation models have been widely adopted for retinal disease classification without systematic evidence justifying their parameter requirements. In the present work we address two critical questions: First, are large domain-specific foundation models essential, or do compact general-purpose architectures suffice? Second, does specialized retinal pretraining justify its computational cost? To answer this, we benchmark initialization strategies across four retinal imaging classification tasks spanning Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Color Fundus Photography (CFP) modalities: 8-class OCT classification, 3-class diabetic macular edema (DME), 5-class diabetic retinopathy (DR), and 3-class glaucoma (GL) detection. We evaluate 12-13 model configurations per task, including vision transformers (22.8M-86.6M parameters), Swin Transformers (27.6M-28.3M), ConvNeXt (28.6M), and the domain-specific RETFound models (303M), under identical training conditions. Our results challenge prevailing assumptions: First, we demonstrate that pretraining provides universal benefits (5.18-18.41% improvement), scaling with task difficulty. Second, compact architectures (27-29M) dominate Pareto frontiers; SwinV2-tiny achieves top-1 performance on three datasets. Third, RETFound (303M) justifies its computational cost only for challenging DR grading (accuracy of 71.15%), while ImageNet pretraining proves to be sufficient with all other tasks (DME accuracy: 99.24%, OCT accuracy: 97.96%). CFP tasks show larger pretraining accuracy gains (9.13-18.41%) than OCT (5.18%). Thus, the evidence suggests that compact general-purpose models deliver near-optimal performance for most retinal classification tasks; specialized foundation models warranted only for fine-grained discrimination under extreme class imbalance."}

Using few-shot prompting with human-in-the-loop validation, we augmented the dataset to over 5,000 stereotype-antistereotype pairs. Entries were validated through semantic clustering and manual annotation by culturally informed reviewers. Preliminary evaluation of language models reveals that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p <= 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes, particularly across age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models appeared to show weaker bias in our setup, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations.

We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse.

However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality.

HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of how low-rank factorization affects LLM trustworthiness across privacy, adversarial robustness, fairness, and ethical alignment. We evaluate multiple LLMs of different sizes and variants compressed with diverse low-rank algorithms, revealing key insights: (1) low-rank compression preserves or improves training data privacy but weakens PII protection during conversation; (2) adversarial robustness is generally preserved and often enhanced, even under deep compression; (3) ethical reasoning degrades in zero-shot settings but partially recovers with few-shot prompting; (4) fairness declines under compression.

However, achieving reliable forecasts remains challenging in regions with complex terrain and strong atmospheric dynamics such as East Asia. While foundation models such as Aurora offer global generality, they often miss region-specific dynamics and rely on non-real-time inputs, limiting their practical utility for localized warning systems. To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts. However, standard point-wise objectives cannot reflect asymmetric operational costs, where false alarms deteriorate public trust while missed severe events endanger populations. This cost mismatch causes SFT models to over-predict and yield high False Alarm Rates. We introduce Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of the forecast. Compared to the SFT-only baseline, our model reduces the False Alarm Rate by 47.3% while achieving a competitive F1-score, proving its effectiveness for practical, real-world air quality forecasting systems on long lead time scenarios."}

Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce Focused Chain-of-Thought (F-CoT), which separates information extraction from the reasoning process. F-CoT first organizes the essential information from a query into a concise, structured context and then guides the model to reason exclusively over this context. By preventing attention to irrelevant details, F-CoT naturally produces shorter reasoning paths. On arithmetic word problems, F-CoT reduces generated tokens by 2-3x while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard zero-shot CoT.

MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states. We evaluate our methods on the Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset, which requires predicting the agent's future 5-second trajectory in bird's-eye-view coordinates using prior camera images, agent pose history, and routing goals. We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output. Our results suggest that transformer-based methods that are used to combine the visual features along with the kinetic features such as the past trajectory features are not effective at combining both modes to produce useful scene context embeddings, even when intention embeddings are augmented with foundation-model representations of scene context from CLIP and DINOv2, but that predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single future trajectory boosts planning performance."}

However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios.

In this scenario, selecting the hardware platform that best balances performance and efficiency for SLM inference is challenging due to strict resource limitations.

To address this limitation, we propose BINDER (Bridging INstant and DEliberative Reasoning), a dual process framework that decouples strategic planning from continuous environment monitoring. Specifically, BINDER integrates a Deliberative Response Module (DRM, a multimodal LLM for task planning) with an Instant Response Module (IRM, a VideoLLM for continuous monitoring). The two modules play complementary roles: the DRM performs strategic planning with structured 3D scene updates and guides what the IRM attends to, while the IRM analyzes video streams to update memory, correct ongoing actions, and trigger replanning when necessary. Through this bidirectional coordination, the modules address the trade off between maintaining awareness and avoiding costly updates, enabling robust adaptation under dynamic conditions.

While regularisation and replay perform well in vision, they lag behind multi-task learning for large language models (LLMs), especially at scale with many tasks. We revisit replay and argue that two failure modes drive this gap: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge). To address selection, we propose Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe), a simple, architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores the most surprising (high Negative Log-Likelihood) sequences. SuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting and delivers the best overall average across both Standard CL and LNT benchmarks. To address integration, we add a dual-learner design with fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via an exponential moving average (EMA), enabling rapid adaptation while stabilising long-term knowledge. Combining SuRe with the dual learner yields further gains, including improvements of up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our proposed method remains robust under reduced replay frequency and small buffer size, demonstrating both effectiveness and sample efficiency.

However, in remote sensing (RS) tasks, we observe widespread pseudo reasoning: models narrate the process of reasoning rather than genuinely reason toward the correct answer based on visual evidence. We attribute this to the Glance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. To instill this paradigm, we propose SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first, RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, followed by RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios. Experiments show RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses reveal clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, confirming RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

While this makes individual AI models clearer, the overarching system architecture remains opaque. This challenge not only pertains to standard XAI techniques but also to human examination and conversational XAI approaches that need access to model internals to interpret them correctly and completely. To this end, we propose conceptually representing such interactive systems as sequences of structural building blocks. These include the AI models themselves, as well as control mechanisms grounded in literature. The structural building blocks can then be explained through complementary explanatory building blocks, such as established XAI techniques like LIME and SHAP.

To date, several approaches have been proposed based on the Residue Number System variant of the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (RNS-CKKS) scheme. However, they all suffer from high latency, which severely limits the applications in real-world tasks. Currently, the research on encrypted inference in deep CNNs confronts three main bottlenecks: i) the time and storage costs of convolution calculation; ii) the time overhead of huge bootstrapping operations; and iii) the consumption of circuit multiplication depth. Towards these three challenges, we in this paper propose an efficient and effective mechanism FastFHE to accelerate the model inference while simultaneously retaining high inference accuracy over fully homomorphic encryption. Concretely, our work elaborates four unique novelties. First, we propose a new scalable ciphertext data-packing scheme to save the time and storage consumptions. Second, we work out a depthwise-separable convolution fashion to degrade the computation load of convolution calculation. Third, we figure out a BN dot-product fusion matrix to merge the ciphertext convolutional layer with the batch-normalization layer without incurring extra multiplicative depth. Last but not least, we adopt the low-degree Legendre polynomial to approximate the nonlinear smooth activation function SiLU under the guarantee of tiny accuracy error before and after encrypted inference.

It follows a procedure with four steps that adaptively selects strategies based on image difficulty and is equipped with specialized tools such as visual reverse search, which emulates how humans gather external geographic clues. Experimental results show that GEO-Detective outperforms baseline large vision language models (LVLMs) overall, particularly on images lacking visible geographic features. In country level geolocation tasks, it achieves an improvement of over 11.1% compared to baseline LLMs, and even at finer grained levels, it still provides around a 5.2% performance gain. Meanwhile, when equipped with external clues, GEO-Detective becomes more likely to produce accurate predictions, reducing the \"unknown\" prediction rate by more than 50.6%. We further explore multiple defense strategies and find that Geo-Detective exhibits stronger robustness, highlighting the need for more effective privacy safeguards."}

In the case of classification, precision and recall are scores with probabilistic interpretations that are both important to consider and complementary. The rankings induced by these two scores are often in partial contradiction. In practice, therefore, it is extremely useful to establish a compromise between the two views to obtain a single, global ranking. Over the last fifty years or so,it has been proposed to take a weighted harmonic mean, known as the F-score, F-measure, or $F_\\beta$. Generally speaking, by averaging basic scores, we obtain a score that is intermediate in terms of values. However, there is no guarantee that these scores lead to meaningful rankings and no guarantee that the rankings are good tradeoffs between these base scores. Given the ubiquity of $F_\\beta$ scores in the literature, some clarification is in order. Concretely: (1) We establish that $F_\\beta$-induced rankings are meaningful and define a shortest path between precision- and recall-induced rankings. (2) We frame the problem of finding a tradeoff between two scores as an optimization problem expressed with Kendall rank correlations. We show that $F_1$ and its skew-insensitive version are far from being optimal in that regard.

However, current spectral GNN methods face two limitations: (1) their broad-spectrum fitting mechanisms degrade the focus on bot-specific spectral features, and (2) certain domain knowledge valuable for bot detection, e.g., low homophily correlates with high-frequency features, has not been fully incorporated into existing methods.To address these challenges, we propose HW-GNN, a novel homophily-aware graph spectral network with Gaussian window constraints.

To systematically evaluate this, we focus on a controlled maze-solving benchmark where reasoning rules are fully visual, difficulty can be tuned by grid size, and all the intermediate steps can be automatically generated. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under a standard SFT-then-RL pipeline, we compare three representative CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations). Our experiments reveal that visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but do not lift the final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; and, strikingly, CoT retaining only the minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes.

In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement.

While common workarounds to this problem are to use a denoiser to estimate what a sample would have been at the end of generation, we propose a simple solution to this problem by working directly with a flow map. By exploiting a relationship between the flow map and velocity field governing the instantaneous transport, we construct an algorithm, Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT), which provably performs better ascent on the reward than standard test-time methods involving the gradient of the reward. The approach can be used to either perform exact sampling via importance weighting or principled search that identifies local maximizers of the reward-tilted distribution.

We propose working with continuous probability outputs, which enables more sophisticated calibration and fusion techniques that can leverage model uncertainty and complementary strengths across different architectures. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for calibrating and fusing EEND models at the probability level. We investigate two output formulations (multilabel and powerset representations) and their impact on calibration and fusion effectiveness. Through extensive experiments on the CallHome two-speaker benchmark, we demonstrate that proper calibration provides substantial improvements even for individual models (up to 19% relative DER reduction), in some cases mitigating the absence of domain adaptation. We reveal that joint calibration in powerset space consistently outperforms independent per-speaker calibration, and that the Fuse-then-Calibrate ordering generally outperforms calibrating individual models before fusion while requiring calibration of only a single combined model. Our best configuration outperforms DOVER-Lap in terms of DER while providing reliable confidence estimates essential for downstream applications.

However, existing generative recommenders overlook this natural refinement process. Generative recommendation formulates next-item prediction as autoregressive generation over tokenized user histories, where each item is represented as a sequence of discrete tokens. Prior models typically fuse heterogeneous attributes such as ID, category, title, and description into a single embedding before quantization, which flattens the inherent semantic hierarchy of items and fails to capture the gradual evolution of user intent during web interactions. To address this limitation, we propose CoFiRec, a novel generative recommendation framework that explicitly incorporates the Coarse-to-Fine nature of item semantics into the tokenization process. Instead of compressing all attributes into a single latent space, CoFiRec decomposes item information into multiple semantic levels, ranging from high-level categories to detailed descriptions and collaborative filtering signals. Based on this design, we introduce the CoFiRec Tokenizer, which tokenizes each level independently while preserving structural order. During autoregressive decoding, the language model is instructed to generate item tokens from coarse to fine, progressively modeling user intent from general interests to specific item-level interests. Experiments across multiple public benchmarks and backbones demonstrate that CoFiRec outperforms existing methods, offering a new perspective for generative recommendation. Theoretically, we prove that structured tokenization leads to lower dissimilarity between generated and ground truth items, supporting its effectiveness in generative recommendation.

The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start. Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate that ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets. This work helps the way of deploying robust CPath models in real-world clinical problems with heterogeneous data sources."}

Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar. Generated CC and MLO views maintained cross view consistency, with 6 to 8 percent of synthetic images exhibiting artifacts consistent with those in the training data. Conclusion: Three channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation."}

However, achieving optimal performance following this regiment requires a large-scale dataset, which is costly to obtain, especially for challenging tasks, such as collision avoidance. In those tasks, generalization at test time demands coverage of many obstacles types and their spatial configurations, which are impractical to acquire purely via data. To remedy this problem, we propose Context-Aware diffusion policy via Proximal mode Expansion (CAPE), a framework that expands trajectory distribution modes with context-aware prior and guidance at inference via a novel prior-seeded iterative guided refinement procedure. The framework generates an initial trajectory plan and executes a short prefix trajectory, and then the remaining trajectory segment is perturbed to an intermediate noise level, forming a trajectory prior. Such a prior is context-aware and preserves task intent. Repeating the process with context-aware guided denoising iteratively expands mode support to allow finding smoother, less collision-prone trajectories. For collision avoidance, CAPE expands trajectory distribution modes with collision-aware context, enabling the sampling of collision-free trajectories in previously unseen environments while maintaining goal consistency. We evaluate CAPE on diverse manipulation tasks in cluttered unseen simulated and real-world settings and show up to 26% and 80% higher success rates respectively compared to SOTA methods, demonstrating better generalization to unseen environments."}

Our method minimizes out-of-distribution (OOD) gap in imitation learning by increasing visual diversity through construction of new experiences using existing demonstrations. By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets.Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes.

Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence. At the end, we show that finetuning on enhanced data, although effective, does not equally remedy all negative impacts of clutter on performance."}

In this paper, we study the amount of carbon dioxide released by models across different domains over varying time periods. By examining parameters such as model size, repository activity (e.g., commits and repository age), task type, and organizational affiliation, we identify key factors influencing the environmental impact of AI development. Our findings reveal that model size and versioning frequency are strongly correlated with higher emissions, while domain-specific trends show that NLP models tend to have lower carbon footprints compared to audio-based systems. Organizational context also plays a significant role, with university-driven projects exhibiting the highest emissions, followed by non-profits and companies, while community-driven projects show a reduction in emissions. These results highlight the critical need for green AI practices, including the adoption of energy-efficient architectures, optimizing development workflows, and leveraging renewable energy sources.

However, many existing methods are tailored to specific supervision patterns -- such as positive-unlabeled (PU), unlabeled-unlabeled (UU), complementary-label (CLL), partial-label (PLL), or similarity-unlabeled annotations -- and rely on post-hoc corrections to mitigate instability induced by indirect supervision. We propose a principled, unified framework that bypasses such post-hoc adjustments by directly formulating a stable surrogate risk grounded in the structure of weakly supervised data. The formulation naturally subsumes diverse settings -- including PU, UU, CLL, PLL, multi-class unlabeled, and tuple-based learning -- under a single optimization objective. We further establish a non-asymptotic generalization bound via Rademacher complexity that clarifies how supervision structure, model capacity, and sample size jointly govern performance. Beyond this, we analyze the effect of class-prior misspecification on the bound, deriving explicit terms that quantify its impact, and we study identifiability, giving sufficient conditions -- most notably via supervision stratification across groups -- under which the target risk is recoverable.

This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers.

In this context, optogenetics enables modulation of gene expression using light as an external input, allowing fine-tuning of protein levels to unlock dynamic metabolic control and regulation of cell growth. Optogenetic systems can be actuated by light intensity. However, relying solely on intensity-driven control (i.e., signal amplitude) may fail to properly tune optogenetic bioprocesses when the dose-response relationship (i.e., light intensity versus gene-expression strength) is steep. In these cases, tunability is effectively constrained to either fully active or fully repressed gene expression, with little intermediate regulation. Pulse-width modulation, a concept widely used in electronics, can alleviate this issue by alternating between fully ON and OFF light intensity within forcing periods, thereby smoothing the average response and enhancing process controllability. Naturally, optimizing pulse-width-modulated optogenetics entails a switching-time optimal control problem with a binary input over many forcing periods. While this can be formulated as a mixed-integer program on a refined time grid, the number of decision variables can grow rapidly with increasing time-grid resolution and number of forcing periods, compromising tractability.

To address this, we introduce Humanoid-LLA, a Large Language Action Model that maps expressive language commands to physically executable whole-body actions for humanoid robots. Our approach integrates three core components: a unified motion vocabulary that aligns human and humanoid motion primitives into a shared discrete space; a vocabulary-directed controller distilled from a privileged policy to ensure physical feasibility; and a physics-informed fine-tuning stage using reinforcement learning with dynamics-aware rewards to enhance robustness and stability. Extensive evaluations in simulation and on a real-world Unitree G1 humanoid show that Humanoid-LLA delivers strong language generalization while maintaining high physical fidelity, outperforming existing language-conditioned controllers in motion naturalness, stability, and execution success rate."}

Automated detection methods can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs; however, existing approaches still face several challenges, including low detection accuracy on imbalanced data, limited semantic extraction due to the use of a single encoder, and suboptimal performance in cross-domain transfer learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Transferable Software Requirement Conflict Detection Framework based on SBERT and SimCSE, termed TSRCDF-SS. First, the framework employs two independent encoders, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and Simple Contrastive Sentence Embedding (SimCSE), to generate sentence embeddings for requirement pairs, followed by a six-element concatenation strategy. Furthermore, the classifier is enhanced by a two-layer fully connected feedforward neural network (FFNN) with a hybrid loss optimization strategy that integrates a variant of Focal Loss, domain-specific constraints, and a confidence-based penalty term. Finally, the framework synergistically integrates sequential and cross-domain transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 10.4% improvement in both macro-F1 and weighted-F1 scores in in-domain settings, and an 11.4% increase in macro-F1 in cross-domain scenarios."}

Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to \"get the right answer for the right visual reason\". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning. This work establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models."}

Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704.

Using 9,970 shots from StatsBomb's 2015-16 data and Football Manager 2017 ratings, we combine Bayesian logistic regression with informed priors to stabilise player-level estimates, especially for players with few shots. The hierarchical model reduces posterior uncertainty relative to weak priors and achieves strong external validity: hierarchical and baseline predictions correlate at R2 = 0.75, while an XGBoost benchmark validated against StatsBomb xG reaches R2 = 0.833. The model uncovers interpretable specialisation profiles, including one-on-one finishing (Aguero, Suarez, Belotti, Immobile, Martial), long-range shooting (Pogba), and first-touch execution (Insigne, Salah, Gameiro). It also identifies latent ability in underperforming players such as Immobile and Belotti. The framework supports counterfactual \"what-if\" analysis by reallocating shots between players under identical contexts. Case studies show that Sansone would generate +2.2 xG from Berardi's chances, driven largely by high-pressure situations, while Vardy-Giroud substitutions reveal strong asymmetry: replacing Vardy with Giroud results in a large decline (about -7 xG), whereas the reverse substitution has only a small effect (about -1 xG).

We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D.

Based on this idea, we implement GAVINA (GAV mIxed-precisioN Accelerator), a novel architecture that supports arbitrary mixed precision and flexible undervolting, with an energy efficiency of up to 89 TOP/sW in its most aggressive configuration. By developing an error model of GAVINA, we show that GAV can achieve an energy efficiency boost of 20% via undervolting, with negligible accuracy degradation on ResNet-18."}

Targeting ten tourism-centric subdomains-Ganga Aarti, Cruise, Food Court, Public Toilet, Kund, Museum, General, Ashram, Temple and Travel, the work addresses the absence of language-specific QA resources in Hindi for culturally nuanced applications. In this paper, a dataset comprising 7,715 Hindi QA pairs pertaining to Varanasi tourism was constructed and subsequently augmented with 27,455 pairs generated via Llama zero-shot prompting. We propose a framework leveraging foundation models-BERT and RoBERTa, fine-tuned using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize parameter efficiency and task performance. Multiple variants of BERT, including pre-trained languages (e.g., Hindi-BERT), are evaluated to assess their suitability for low-resource domain-specific QA. Evaluation metrics - F1, BLEU, and ROUGE-L - highlight trade-offs between answer precision and linguistic fluency. Experiments demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning achieves competitive performance (85.3\\% F1) while reducing trainable parameters by 98\\% compared to SFT, striking a balance between efficiency and accuracy. Comparative analysis across models reveals that RoBERTa with SFT outperforms BERT variants in capturing contextual nuances, particularly for culturally embedded terms (e.g., Aarti, Kund). This work establishes a foundational baseline for Hindi tourism QA systems, emphasizing the role of LORA in low-resource settings and underscoring the need for culturally contextualized NLP frameworks in the tourism domain."}

Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives."}

Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes.

Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851.

The effectiveness of these evaluations faces a significant challenge: strategic underperformance, or ``sandbagging'', where models deliberately underperform during evaluation. Sandbagging can manifest either through explicit developer intervention or through unintended model behavior, presenting a fundamental obstacle to accurate capability assessment. We introduce a novel sandbagging detection method based on injecting noise of varying magnitudes into model weights. While non-sandbagging models show predictable performance degradation with increasing noise, we demonstrate that sandbagging models exhibit anomalous performance improvements, likely due to disruption of underperformance mechanisms while core capabilities remain partially intact. Through experiments across various model architectures, sizes, and sandbagging techniques, we establish this distinctive response pattern as a reliable, model-agnostic signal for detecting sandbagging behavior.

A simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput.

However, their tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their reliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and trustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and mitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we advance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea is to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to customize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner, supporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we design a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime verification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific constraints defined in ESL. We evaluate RvLLM on three representative tasks: violation detection against Singapore Rapid Transit Systems Act, numerical comparison, and inequality solving. Experimental results demonstrate that RvLLM effectively detects erroneous outputs across various LLMs in a lightweight and flexible manner. The results reveal that despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs remain prone to low-level errors due to limited interpretability and a lack of formal guarantees during inference, and our framework offers a potential long-term solution by leveraging expert domain knowledge to rigorously and efficiently verify LLM outputs."}

To date, an end-to-end open-source solution for autonomous verification remains absent.We introduce PRO-V-R1, the first trainable open-source agentic framework for autonomous RTL verification. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we design PRO-V sys, a modular agentic system that couples LLM-based reasoning with programmatic tool use for RTL verification; (2) we establish a data construction pipeline that leverages existing RTL datasets to build simulation-validated, expert-level trajectories tailored for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) RTL verification agents; and (3) we implement an efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that uses verification-specific rewards derived from program-tool feedback to optimize the end-to-end verification workflow.

This subgraph, which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems.

Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is irrelevant and can be abstracted.

While simple, this implicitly assumes compensability: exceptional performance in some areas can offset severe deficiencies in others. Genuine general intelligence, however, requires coherent sufficiency: balanced competence across all essential faculties. We introduce a coherence-based measure of AGI that integrates the generalized mean over a continuum of compensability exponents. This yields an area-under-the-curve (AUC) metric spanning arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, quantifying how robust an evaluated capability remains as compensability assumptions become stricter. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and exposes bottlenecks that constrain performance. To illustrate the framework, we apply it to cognitive profiles derived from the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model, showing how coherence-based aggregation highlights imbalances that are obscured by arithmetic averaging.

Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions. Our results offer a general theory of analogical inference across discrete and continuous domains."}

However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research.

Through systematic experimentation with GPT-2 fine-tuned on The Psychology of Artificial Superintelligence, we evaluate seven locality configurations ranging from fully distributed to strictly localist, with five progressive schedules implementing polynomial increases (linear through quintic). We investigate whether interpretability constraints can be aligned with natural semantic structure while being applied strategically across network depth. We demonstrate that progressive semantic localization, combining adaptive semantic block partitioning with steep polynomial locality schedules, achieves near-baseline language modeling performance while providing interpretable attention patterns. Multiple independent training runs with different random seeds establish that results are statistically robust and highly reproducible. The approach dramatically outperforms both fixed-window localization and naive uniform locality constraints. Analysis reveals that maintaining flexibility through low-fidelity constraints preserves model capacity while providing interpretability benefits, and that steep schedules concentrating locality in decision-critical final layers while preserving distributed learning in early layers achieve near-baseline attention distribution characteristics. These findings demonstrate that interpretability mechanisms should align with semantic structure to achieve practical performance-interpretability tradeoffs for trustworthy AI systems."}

To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO."}

In this paper, we first identify causes of the above interference, and hypothesize that correlations between data representations are a key factor of interference. We then propose a method for promoting appropriate correlations between arbitrary tasks' data representations (i.e., global alignment) in individual task learning. Specifically, we learn the data representation as a task-specific composition of pre-trained token representations shared across all tasks. Then the correlations between different tasks' data representations are grounded by correlations between pre-trained token representations. We explore different ways to learn such compositions.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), can enhance simulated patients by replicating medical conditions and doctor patient interactions with high fidelity and at low cost, but effectiveness and trustworthiness remain open challenges. Methods: We developed AIPatient, a simulated patient system powered by LLM based AI agents. The system uses a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) framework with six task specific agents for complex reasoning. To improve realism, it is linked to the AIPatient knowledge graph built from de identified real patient data in the MIMIC III intensive care database. Results: We evaluated electronic health record (EHR) based medical question answering (QA), readability, robustness, stability, and user experience. AIPatient reached 94.15 percent QA accuracy when all six agents were enabled, outperforming versions with partial or no agent integration. The knowledge base achieved an F1 score of 0.89. Readability scores showed a median Flesch Reading Ease of 68.77 and a median Flesch Kincaid Grade of 6.4, indicating accessibility for most medical trainees and clinicians. Robustness and stability were supported by non significant variance in repeated trials (analysis of variance F value 0.61, p greater than 0.1; F value 0.78, p greater than 0.1).

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a promising solution, enabling on-the-fly model adaptation. However, its effectiveness deteriorates in the presence of mixed distribution shifts -- common in practical settings -- where multiple target domains coexist. In this paper, we study TTA under mixed distribution shifts and move beyond conventional whole-batch adaptation paradigms. By revisiting distribution shifts from a spectral perspective, we find that the heterogeneity across latent domains is often pronounced in Fourier space. In particular, high-frequency components encode domain-specific variations, which facilitates clearer separation of samples from different distributions. Motivated by this observation, we propose to un-mix heterogeneous data streams using high-frequency domain cues, making diverse shift patterns more tractable. To this end, we propose Frequency-based Decentralized Adaptation (FreDA), a novel framework that decomposes globally heterogeneous data stream into locally homogeneous clusters in the Fourier space. It leverages decentralized learning and augmentation strategies to robustly adapt under mixed domain shifts.

Moving beyond such introspection and inspired by core methodologies in ethology, we propose an externalist three-step framework Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR). Rather than relying on a model's introspection, DRR evaluates its observable behaviors to provide corrective feedback. DRR first distills the reasoner's behavioral traces, then trains a lightweight, external Discriminative Model (DM). At inference time, this DM acts as a critic, identifying and rejecting suspicious reasoning steps. This external feedback compels the LLM to discard flawed pathways and explore alternatives, thereby enhancing reasoning quality without altering the base model.

Logical constants are then defined in terms of what is supported by such a base: intrinsically, by relations that hold within it, and extrinsically, by the behaviour of those relations under extension. This yields a general semantic framework in which familiar systems (classical, intuitionistic, and various intermediate logics) arise naturally from different assumptions about the form of knowledge. This offers a reversal of the traditional explanatory order: rather than treating logic as a precondition for the articulation of knowledge, it shows how logical structure can emerge from epistemic organisation."}

However, they often require large amounts of data and can exhibit biases, such as center or size bias, that limit their robustness and generalizability. This paper introduces ForAug, a novel data augmentation operation that addresses these challenges by explicitly imposing invariances into the training data, which are otherwise part of the neural network architecture. ForAug is constructed by using pretrained foundation models to separate and recombine foreground objects with different backgrounds. This recombination step enables us to take fine-grained control over object position and size, as well as background selection. We demonstrate that using ForAug significantly improves the accuracy of ViTs and other architectures by up to 4.5 percentage points (p.p.) on ImageNet, which translates to 7.3 p.p. on downstream tasks. Importantly, ForAug not only improves accuracy but also opens new ways to analyze model behavior and quantify biases. Namely, we introduce metrics for background robustness, foreground focus, center bias, and size bias and show that using ForAug during training substantially reduces these biases. In summary, ForAug provides a valuable tool for analyzing and mitigating biases, enabling the development of more robust and reliable computer vision models.

However, in practice, data availability often exhibits a hybrid nature, where both regimes coexist. This hybrid setting presents new opportunities for model training, as the two regimes offer complementary trade-offs: decentralized data is abundant but subject to heterogeneity and communication constraints, while centralized data, though limited in volume and potentially unrepresentative, enables better curation and high-throughput access. Despite its potential, effectively combining these paradigms remains challenging, and few frameworks are tailored to hybrid data regimes. To address this, we propose a novel framework that constructs a model atlas from decentralized models and leverages centralized data to refine a global model within this structured space. The refined model is then used to reinitialize the decentralized models. Our method synergizes federated learning (to exploit decentralized data) and model merging (to utilize centralized data), enabling effective training under hybrid data availability. Theoretically, we show that our approach achieves faster convergence than methods relying solely on decentralized data, due to variance reduction in the merging process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms purely centralized, purely decentralized, and existing hybrid-adaptable methods. Notably, our method remains robust even when the centralized and decentralized data domains differ or when decentralized data contains noise, significantly broadening its applicability."}

In contrast to existing text-to-image models whose outputs contain baked-in scene lighting, our approach predicts physically-based rendering (PBR) maps. This enables the generated outputs to be used for content creation scenarios in core graphics applications that facilitate re-lighting, editing, and texture generation tasks. In order to train our generator, we exploit strong image priors, and pre-train separate models for each PBR material component (albedo, roughness, metallic, normals). We then align these models with a new cross-intrinsic attention formulation that concatenates key and value features in a consistent fashion. This allows us to exchange information between each output modality and to obtain semantically coherent PBR predictions. To ground each intrinsic component, we propose a rendering loss which provides image-space signals to constrain the model, thus facilitating sharp details also in the output BRDF properties. Our results demonstrate detailed intrinsic generation with strong generalization capabilities that outperforms existing intrinsic image decomposition methods used with generated images by a significant margin. Finally, we show a series of applications, including re-lighting, editing, and text-conditioned room-scale PBR texture generation."}

Our empirical evaluation of widely used agent systems on cybersecurity benchmarks highlights that current AI agents struggle with flexible workflow planning and using domain-specific tools for complex security analysis -- capabilities particularly critical for defensive applications.

While recent work has shown that it is possible to disentangle these factors to some extent, such methods come with an overhead of requiring an additional (weaker) model, or require more forward passes per sampling step.

Our further analysis demonstrates that the problem is related to the erroneous activation of irrelevant knowledge and conflicts between activated knowledge.

Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer memory is uniform and efficient.

Our unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and (2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary, including worst-case, levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are tighter than prior methods using $\\varepsilon$-DP, Rényi DP, and concentrated DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., an accuracy increase from 52% to 70% in a text classification task.

We isolate three distinct forms of nonlocal vision: comparative perception, which demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves following a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4), even those that perform well on prior primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans.

Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities."}

This limits their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach, on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation, frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over baselines.

To address this challenge, we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning, leading to evocative and compact trait reflection.

Motivated by a pre-registered pilot study suggesting a positive correlation between a skill's \"teachability\" by AI and its vulnerability to automation, we show that this information friction leads to a systematic skill mismatch. The planner over-invests in skills destined for obsolescence, a distortion that increases monotonically with AI prevalence. Extensions demonstrate that this mismatch is exacerbated by the neglect of unpriced non-cognitive skills and by the endogenous over-adoption of educational technology.

While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these simulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often difficult to identify, restricting their ability to model complex switching mechanisms between metastable states. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that this problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium ensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a powerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach successfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the temporal evolution between them. We introduce the Graph Latent Dynamics Propagator (GLDP), a modular component for simulating dynamics within the learned latent space of LD-FPG. We then compare three classes of propagators: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear operators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified encoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability, backbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and temporal kinetics via TICA. Benchmarks on systems ranging from small peptides to mixed-topology proteins and large GPCRs reveal that autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long rollouts and coherent physical timescales; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when the score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight baseline that tends to damp fluctuations.

Partial observability of vehicle flows complicates this task despite the availability of two privacy preserving data sources: (i) aggregated vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated floating car data (aFCD) that provide segment-wise average speed measurements. However, how to integrate these sources with differing spatial and temporal resolutions for queue length estimation is rather unclear. Addressing this question, we present Q Net: a robust queue estimation framework built upon a state-space formulation. This formulation addresses key challenges in queue modeling, such as violations of traffic conservation assumptions. To overcome the limitations of standard filtering models in integrating diverse data sources, Q-Net employs an AI-augmented Kalman filter for estimation. Q-Net follows the Kalman predict-update framework and maintains physical interpretability, with internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Q-Net can be implemented in real-time, making it suitable for integration into queue-based traffic control systems. To achieve spatial transferability across road sections, we group aFCD measurements into fixed-size groups. This strategy ensures the dimension of Q-Net's learnable parameters is independent of section length. Evaluations on urban main roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, show that Q-Net outperforms baseline methods, accurately tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays. By combining data efficiency, interpretability, and strong transferability, Q Net makes accurate queue length estimation possible without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar."}

In such settings, RL must either rely on supervision-intensive reward models that often fail to generalize, or it falls into pathological behaviors such as reward hacking - an especially troubling risk for high-stakes medical dialogue. To address these limitations, we introduce ORBIT, an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates synthetic dialogue generation with dynamically constructed rubrics that serve as adaptive guides for incremental RL. Instead of relying on external medical knowledge bases or handcrafted rule sets, ORBIT uses rubric-driven feedback to steer the learning process. Its judge component can be instantiated with general-purpose instruction-following LLMs, removing the need for any task-specific fine-tuning. Applied to the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model, ORBIT raises the HealthBench-Hard score from 7.0 to 27.5 using only 2k training samples, achieving SOTA performance for models at this scale. With larger rubric datasets, ORBIT-trained models further compete with the strongest open-source baselines on HealthBench-Hard.

Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured, automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from 37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents.

At the same time, the long prompt introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to prune redundant information in navigation maps.

This technical report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept, modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental testing across power and logarithmic value function specifications, demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications achieve validation score 59/60 compared to power functions (55/60), with both demonstrating strong empirical fit to S-LCD historical patterns.

The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a powerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing the stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through noisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive parallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been challenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with the estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization bottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of parallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner (VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP formulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component, leaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP represents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors and implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this representation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies and synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental results indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing near-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online solver."}

Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style.

This distilled knowledge is stored in a structured memory, enabling the agent to improve execution accuracy over time. We design and evaluate multiple variations of a learning agent architecture that vary in how they capture and retrieve past experiences.

In large or low-resource courses, instructors often lack the time, staffing, and bandwidth required to review and respond to every student reflection, creating gaps in support precisely where learners would benefit most. This paper presents a theory-grounded system that uses five coordinated role-based LLM agents (Evaluator, Equity Monitor, Metacognitive Coach, Aggregator, and Reflexion Reviewer) to score learner reflections with a shared rubric and to generate short, bias-aware, learner-facing comments. The agents first produce structured rubric scores, then check for potentially biased or exclusionary language, add metacognitive prompts that invite students to think about their own thinking, and finally compose a concise feedback message of at most 120 words. The system includes simple fairness checks that compare scoring error across lower and higher scoring learners, enabling instructors to monitor and bound disparities in accuracy. We evaluate the pipeline in a 12-session AI literacy program with adult learners. In this setting, the system produces rubric scores that approach expert-level agreement, and trained graders rate the AI-generated comments as helpful, empathetic, and well aligned with instructional goals. Taken together, these results show that multi-agent LLM systems can deliver equitable, high-quality formative feedback at a scale and speed that would be impossible for human graders alone. More broadly, the work points toward a future where feedback-rich learning becomes feasible for any course size or context, advancing long-standing goals of equity, access, and instructional capacity in education."}

Despite increasing policy and research attention, existing LoC definitions vary significantly in scope and timeline, hindering effective LoC assessment and mitigation. To address this issue, we draw from an extensive literature review and propose a graded LoC taxonomy, based on the metrics of severity and persistence, that distinguishes between Deviation, Bounded LoC, and Strict LoC. We model pathways toward a societal state of vulnerability in which sufficiently advanced AI systems have acquired or could acquire the means to cause Bounded or Strict LoC once a catalyst, either misalignment or pure malfunction, materializes. We argue that this state becomes increasingly likely over time, absent strategic intervention, and propose a strategy to avoid reaching a state of vulnerability. Rather than focusing solely on intervening on AI capabilities and propensities potentially relevant for LoC or on preventing potential catalysts, we introduce a complementary framework that emphasizes three extrinsic factors: Deployment context, Affordances, and Permissions (the DAP framework). Compared to work on intrinsic factors and catalysts, this framework has the unfair advantage of being actionable today. Finally, we put forward a plan to maintain preparedness and prevent the occurrence of LoC outcomes should a state of societal vulnerability be reached, focusing on governance measures (threat modeling, deployment policies, emergency response) and technical controls (pre-deployment testing, control measures, monitoring) that could maintain a condition of perennial suspension."}

Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance.

Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions.

Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute \"delta\" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation.

While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we approximate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks ($+$2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing chain-of-thought reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller $\\Delta$ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first benchmarking study to systematically integrate structured prompting into an established evaluation framework, demonstrating how scalable performance-ceiling approximation yields more robust, decision-useful benchmarks.

However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness."}

However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks.

To make the comparison concrete and domain-agnostic, we design a controlled suite of experiments in which models embed short numerical sequences and are evaluated on their ability to cluster and classify those sequences according to well-defined number-theoretic properties. Our experimental protocol compares four families of models: (1) non-LLM encoders trained from scratch or fine-tuned for embeddings, (2) LLM-based encoders adapted with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA), (3) LLM-based encoders with LoRA followed by model souping merging into the base weights, and (4) the same LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP across checkpoints or stages. We evaluate representational quality with clustering indices (Silhouette and Davies Bouldin). We additionally analyze the use of kmeans labels to see if the embeddings encode any other information besides the one we are testing for.

Many models are being pre-trained using the same architecture as wav2vec 2.0 and are getting state-of-the-art in various speech-related tasks. Previous work has demonstrated that the data used during the pre-training of these wav2vec2-based models can impact the model's performance in downstream tasks, and this should be taken into consideration before utilizing these models. However, few works have proposed investigating further how the transfer knowledge of these pre-trained models behaves in different languages, even when the target language differs from the one used during the model's pre-training. Our work aims to investigate the cross-lingual transferability of these wav2vec2-based models. We performed several fine-tuning experiments on the speech recognition task in 18 languages using 15 large pre-trained models. The results of our experiments showed us that the size of data used during the pre-training of these models is not as important to the final performance as the diversity. We noticed that the performance of Indo-European languages is superior to non-Indo-European languages in the evaluated models. We have observed a positive cross-lingual transfer of knowledge using monolingual models, which was evident in all the languages we used, but more pronounced when the language used during pre-training was more similar to the downstream task language.

Most existing selection bias metrics require answer labels and measure divergences between prediction and answer distributions, but do not fully capture the consistency of a model's predictions across different orderings of answer choices. Existing selection bias mitigation strategies have notable limitations: majority voting, though effective, is computationally prohibitive; calibration-based methods require validation sets and often fail to generalize across datasets.

To detect both explicit and implicit biases, we adopt a three-pronged approach for thorough and inclusive analysis. Results indicate fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excel at identifying and avoiding racial biases.

We implemented this methodology on a public dataset of 40,432 Original (OR) and Computer-Generated (CG) reviews. From an initial set of 13,539 features, HHO selected the most applicable 1,368 features, achieving an 89.9% dimensionality reduction. Our final stacking model achieved 95.40% accuracy, 92.81% precision, 95.01% recall, and a 93.90% F1-Score, which demonstrates that the combination of ensemble learning and bio-inspired optimisation is an effective method for machine-generated text recognition. Because large-scale review analytics commonly run on cloud platforms, privacy-preserving techniques such as differential approaches and secure outsourcing are essential to protect user data in these systems."}

In open-domain applications visual and textual cues often conflict, requiring models to perform structured reasoning beyond surface-level alignment. We introduce CrossCheck-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating contradiction detection in multimodal inputs. The benchmark adopts a hierarchical task framework covering three levels of reasoning complexity and defines seven atomic capabilities essential for resolving cross-modal inconsistencies. CrossCheck-Bench includes 15k question-answer pairs sourced from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected contradictions. The dataset is constructed through a multi-stage annotation pipeline involving more than 450 expert hours to ensure semantic validity and calibrated difficulty across perception, integration, and reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models and observe a consistent performance drop as tasks shift from perceptual matching to logical contradiction detection. Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Capability-level analysis further reveals uneven skill acquisition, especially in tasks requiring multi-step inference or rule-based validation. Additional probing shows that conventional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Set-of-Mark yield only marginal gains. By contrast, methods that interleave symbolic reasoning with grounded visual processing achieve more stable improvements. These results highlight a persistent bottleneck in multimodal reasoning and suggest new directions for building models capable of robust cross-modal verification."}

However, such efforts often overlook attacks that exploit the model's capacity for abstract generalization, creating a critical blind spot in current alignment strategies. This gap enables adversaries to induce objectionable content by subtly manipulating the implicit social values embedded in model outputs. In this paper, we introduce MICM, a novel, model-agnostic jailbreak method that targets the aggregate value structure reflected in LLM responses. Drawing on conceptual morphology theory, MICM encodes specific configurations of nuanced concepts into a fixed prompt template through a predefined set of phrases. These phrases act as conceptual triggers, steering model outputs toward a specific value stance without triggering conventional safety filters. We evaluate MICM across five advanced LLMs, including GPT-4o, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen3-8B. Experimental results show that MICM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving high success rates with minimal rejection. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability in commercial LLMs: their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to covert manipulation of underlying value alignment."}

For open-ended generation, non-expert users often lack the knowledge or time to consistently craft high-quality prompts, leading them to rely on prompt optimization tools. However, a key challenge is ensuring the optimized prompts genuinely align with users' original intents and preferences. We introduce PromptTailor, a system for controllable prompt generation for open-ended text that improves model output quality by intent-aligned prompt synthesis. PromptTailor expands minimal user instructions into rich, domain-aware prompts while preserving the user's stated preferences. The system is a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with a lightweight LoRA adapter on 12,300 prompt-refinement dialogues spanning 41 everyday domains, distilled from three stronger LLMs. The adapter attaches to any Llama3-8B base, enabling edge deployment. In human and LLM-judge evaluations across multiple target models and optimization baselines, PromptTailor yields higher preference rates than chain-of-thought prompting and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods while requiring fewer model calls (e.g., 3 vs. 9). These results show that a compact student, guided by powerful teachers, can learn effective prompt-generation strategies that enhance response quality while maintaining alignment with user intent."}

Existing memory frameworks and benchmarks focus on finding the optimal memory compression algorithm for higher performance in tasks that require recollection and sometimes further reasoning. However, such efforts have ended up building more human bias into the compression algorithm, through the search for the best prompts and memory architectures that suit specific benchmarks, rather than finding a general solution that would work on other data distributions. On the other hand, goal-directed search on uncompressed information could potentially exhibit superior performance because compression is lossy, and a predefined compression algorithm will not fit all raw data distributions. Here we present SUMER (Search in Uncompressed Memory via Experience Replay), an end-to-end reinforcement learning agent with verifiable reward (RLVR) that learns to use search tools to gather information and answer a target question. On the LoCoMo dataset for long-context conversation understanding, SUMER with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct learned to use search tools and outperformed all other biased memory compression approaches and also the full-context baseline, reaching SOTA performance (43% gain over the prior best).

Our results expose a clear generalization cliff: embedding-based methods perform strongly on familiar contexts, yet degrade considerably on novel ones, while LLM-generated procedural abstractions demonstrate reliable cross-context transfer. Controlled ablations show that although embeddings capture some lexical-level abstraction, they fundamentally treat procedures as unordered bags of words, discarding temporal structure necessary for cross-context transfer.

In the first test, performed with ChatGPT and Gemini, we show that Bell's inequalities are significantly violated, which indicates the presence of 'quantum entanglement' in the tested concepts. In the second test, also performed using ChatGPT and Gemini, we instead identify the presence of 'Bose-Einstein statistics', rather than the intuitively expected 'Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics', in the distribution of the words contained in large-size texts. Interestingly, these findings mirror the results previously obtained in both cognitive tests with human participants and information retrieval tests on large corpora. Taken together, they point to the 'systematic emergence of quantum structures in conceptual-linguistic domains', regardless of whether the cognitive agent is human or artificial. Although LLMs are classified as neural networks for historical reasons, we believe that a more essential form of knowledge organization takes place in the distributive semantic structure of vector spaces built on top of the neural network. It is this meaning-bearing structure that lends itself to a phenomenon of evolutionary convergence between human cognition and language, slowly established through biological evolution, and LLM cognition and language, emerging much more rapidly as a result of self-learning and training. We analyze various aspects and examples that contain evidence supporting the above hypothesis. We also advance a unifying framework that explains the pervasive quantum organization of meaning that we identify."}

Although producing humor requires complex cognitive reasoning and social understanding, theories of humor suggest that it follows learnable patterns and structures, making it theoretically possible for generative models to acquire them implicitly. In recent years, multimodal humor has become a prevalent form of online communication, especially among Gen Z, highlighting the need for AI systems capable of integrating visual understanding with humorous language generation. However, existing data-driven approaches lack explicit modeling or theoretical grounding of humor, often producing literal descriptions that fail to capture its underlying cognitive mechanisms, resulting in the generated image descriptions that are fluent but lack genuine humor or cognitive depth. To address this limitation, we propose HUMORCHAIN (HUmor-guided Multi-step Orchestrated Reasoning Chain for Image Captioning), a theory-guided multi-stage reasoning framework. It integrates visual semantic parsing, humor- and psychology-based reasoning, and a fine-tuned discriminator for humor evaluation, forming an interpretable and controllable cognitive reasoning chain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly embed cognitive structures from humor theories into multimodal humor generation, enabling a structured reasoning process from visual understanding to humor creation.

RoSA comprises a RoPE-aware Attention Enhancement (RoAE) module, which selectively enhances the low-frequency components of RoPE-influenced attention states, and a Dynamic Layer Selection (DLS) strategy that adaptively identifies and updates the most critical layers based on LayerNorm gradient norms. By combining dimension-wise enhancement with layer-wise adaptation, RoSA achieves more targeted and efficient fine-tuning.

A novel L&T-specific metrics framework was developed to assess accuracy in reporting attributes such as type, longitudinal change and placement. A first-of-its-kind retrospective user evaluation study was conducted with nine radiologists of varying experience, who blindly reviewed 600 studies from distinct subjects.

We find that reasoning token length expands as performance improves, peaks at the stage of conscious competence, then declines as the model internalizes the task. Notably, after training, models retain performance even when reasoning is removed--suggesting it scaffolded learning but is no longer needed. This progression offers actionable insights: reasoning token dynamics can serve as a signal for diagnosing training stage, identifying convergence, and guiding early stopping. We propose metrics to track this trajectory and argue that reasoning behavior is valuable for understanding and optimizing reasoning model training."}

Most existing approaches to AI-generated text detection rely on fine-tuning large transformer models or building ensembles, which are computationally expensive and often provide limited generalization across domains. Existing lightweight alternatives achieved significantly lower accuracy on large datasets. We introduce NEULIF, a lightweight approach that achieves best performance in the lightweight detector class, that does not require extensive computational power and provides high detection accuracy. In our approach, a text is first decomposed into stylometric and readability features which are then used for classification by a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Random Forest (RF). Evaluated and tested on the Kaggle AI vs. Human corpus, our models achieve 97% accuracy (~ 0.95 F1) for CNN and 95% accuracy (~ 0.94 F1) for the Random Forest, demonstrating high precision and recall, with ROC-AUC scores of 99.5% and 95%, respectively. The CNN (~ 25 MB) and Random Forest (~ 10.6 MB) models are orders of magnitude smaller than transformer-based ensembles and can be run efficiently on standard CPU devices, without sacrificingthis http URLstudy also highlights the potential of such models for broader applications across languages, domains, and streaming contexts, showing that simplicity, when guided by structural insights, can rival complexity in AI-generated content detection."}

In specialized domains, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to assist subject matter experts with domain-specific challenges. However, deploying LLMs as SaaS solutions raises data privacy concerns, while many open-source models demand significant computational resources for effective domain adaptation and deployment. A promising alternative is to develop smaller, domain-specialized LLMs, though this approach is often constrained by the lack of high-quality domain-specific training data. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a cost-efficient and scalable training pipeline that combines guided synthetic data generation from a small seed corpus with bottom-up domain data curation. Our pipeline integrates Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), Domain-specific Supervised Fine-tuning (DSFT), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train effective small-scale models for specialized use cases. We demonstrate this approach through DiagnosticSLM, a 3B-parameter domain-specific model tailored for fault diagnosis, root cause analysis, and repair recommendation in industrial settings. To evaluate model performance, we introduce four domain-specific benchmarks: multiple-choice questions (DiagnosticMCQ), question answering (DiagnosticQA), sentence completion (DiagnosticComp), and summarization (DiagnosticSum). DiagnosticSLM achieves up to 25% accuracy improvement over open-source models of comparable or larger size (2B-9B) on the MCQ task, while also outperforming or matching them in other tasks, demonstrating effective domain-specific reasoning and generalization capabilities."}

Experimenting with the SemEval 2023 Task 3 taxonomy across the synthetic persuasion dataset, we demonstrate significant variations in detection performance across language agents.

We show that prompt engineering dramatically affects detection efficacy, with temperature settings and confidence scoring producing model-specific variations; Gemma and GPT-4 perform optimally at lower temperatures while Llama3 and Mistral show improved capabilities at higher temperatures. Our causal analysis provides novel insights into socio-emotional-cognitive signatures of persuasion attacks, revealing that different attack types target specific cognitive dimensions.

In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection."}

Situation awareness about such disaster impacts generated by authoritative data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, and/or geographic data is often limited due to atmospheric opacity, satellite revisits, and time limitations. This often results in geo-temporal information gaps. In contrast, impact-related social media posts can act as \"geo-sensors\" during a disaster, where people describe specific impacts and locations. However, not all locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts relate to an impact. Only the impacted locations are critical for directing resources effectively. e.g., \"The death toll from a fire which ripped through the Greek coastal town of #Mati stood at 80, with dozens of people unaccounted for as forensic experts tried to identify victims who were burned alive #Greecefires #AthensFires #Athens #Greece.\" contains impacted location \"Mati\" and non-impacted locations \"Greece\" and \"Athens\". This research uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify all locations, impacts and impacted locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts. In the process, LLMs are fine-tuned to identify only impacts and impacted locations (as distinct from other, non-impacted locations), including locations mentioned in informal expressions, abbreviations, and short forms. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates efficacy, achieving an F1-score of 0.69 for impact and 0.74 for impacted location extraction, substantially outperforming the pre-trained baseline. These robust results confirm the potential of fine-tuned language models to offer a scalable solution for timely decision-making in resource allocation, situational awareness, and post-disaster recovery planning for responders."}

We verify this mechanism via an ablation study, demonstrating that suppressing Layer 46 reduces the model's confidence in hallucinatory outputs by 81.8%.

Existing frameworks further enhance its inference efficiency by enabling KV caching. However, its bidirectional attention mechanism necessitates periodic cache refreshes that interleave prefill and decoding phases, both contributing substantial inference cost and constraining achievable speedup. Inspired by the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the prefill and decoding phases, we propose ODB-dLLM, a framework that orchestrates dual-boundaries to accelerate dLLM inference. In the prefill phase, we find that the predefined fixed response length introduces heavy yet redundant computational overhead, which affects efficiency. To alleviate this, ODB-dLLM incorporates an adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead and unnecessary computation. In the decoding phase, we analyze the computational characteristics of dLLMs and propose a dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method to enhance efficiency by reducing the number of decoding iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that ODB-dLLM achieves 46-162x and 2.63-6.30x speedups over the baseline dLLM and Fast-dLLM, respectively, while simultaneously mitigating the accuracy degradation in existing acceleration frameworks."}

Bridging this gap is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and to develop cross-modal brain representations. To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI."}

However, despite the growing use of LLMs in review systems, their capabilities to pinpoint errors remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fault Localization Across Writing in Science (FLAWS), an automated benchmark consisting of 713 paper-error pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs detect errors that undermine key claims in research papers. We construct the benchmark by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs, paired with an automated evaluation metric that measures whether models can identify and localize these errors. Developing such a benchmark presents unique challenges that we overcome: ensuring that the inserted errors are well-defined, challenging, and relevant to the content of the paper, avoiding artifacts that would make identification trivial, and designing a scalable, automated evaluation metric.

Our contributions are threefold: (1) Evaluate WOZ-based operator-steered valence trajectories as a design for emotion research; (2) Quantify human annotation performance and variation, including divergences between self-reports and third-party judgments; (3) Benchmark detection and forward-looking emotion inference in real-time support.

First, we hypothesize that a fine-tuned model will outperform a zero-shot LLM baseline. Second, we hypothesize that performance is genre-dependent. Our experiments strongly confirm Hypothesis 2: structured genres (e.g. Folklore & Tradition) yield significantly higher attribution accuracy than more abstract genres (e.g. Love & Romance). Hypothesis 1 receives only partial support: fine-tuning improves robustness and generalization in Test1 (real-world data and difficult genres), but offers limited or ambiguous gains in Test2, a smaller, synthetically-augmented set. We show that the design limitations of Test2 (e.g., label imbalance, shallow lexical differences, and narrow genre sampling) can obscure the true effectiveness of fine-tuning.Our work establishes the first benchmark for cross-genre Chinese lyric attribution, highlights the importance of genre-sensitive evaluation, and provides a public dataset and analytical framework for future research.

Here, we present a pipeline to systematically probe attention mechanisms, and we illustrate its value by leveraging lexical ambiguity--where a single word has multiple meanings--to isolate attention mechanisms that contribute to word sense disambiguation. We take a \"developmental\" approach: first, using publicly available Pythia LM checkpoints, we identify inflection points in disambiguation performance for each LM in the suite; in 14M and 410M, we identify heads whose attention to disambiguating words covaries with overall disambiguation performance across development. We then stress-test the robustness of these heads to stimulus perturbations: in 14M, we find limited robustness, but in 410M, we identify multiple heads with surprisingly generalizable behavior. Then, in a causal analysis, we find that ablating the target heads demonstrably impairs disambiguation performance, particularly in 14M. We additionally reproduce developmental analyses of 14M across all of its random seeds. Together, these results suggest: that disambiguation benefits from a constellation of mechanisms, some of which (especially in 14M) are highly sensitive to the position and part-of-speech of the disambiguating cue; and that larger models (410M) may contain heads with more robust disambiguation behavior. They also join a growing body of work that highlights the value of adopting a developmental perspective when probing LM mechanisms."}

Preliminary evaluation of language models reveals that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p <= 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes, particularly across age, profession, and gender dimensions.

Our ablations confirm the value of temporal structure and knowledge augmentation, and fairness analysis shows HiTGNN performs more equitably across subgroups."}

However, when both text and images exist in the database, similarity scores would differ in scale by modality. This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, hinders accurate retrieval. Most existing studies address this issue with manually labeled data, e.g., by fine-tuning VLMs on them. In this work, we propose a similarity standardization approach with pseudo data construction. We first compute the mean and variance of the similarity scores between each query and its paired data in text or image modality. Using these modality-specific statistics, we standardize all similarity scores to compare on a common scale across modalities. These statistics are calculated from pseudo pairs, which are constructed by retrieving the text and image candidates with the highest cosine similarity to each query. We evaluate our method across seven VLMs using two multi-modal QA benchmarks (MMQA and WebQA), where each question requires retrieving either text or image data. Our experimental results show that our method significantly improves retrieval performance, achieving average Recall@20 gains of 64% on MMQA and 28% on WebQA when the query and the target data belong to different modalities.

While DYNARTmo does not implement full task-dynamic second-order biomechanics, it adopts first-order task-space gesture specifications comparable to those used in articulatory phonology and integrates a simplified mechanism for distributing articulatory effort across multiple articulators. We first outline the conceptual relationship between task dynamics and DYNARTmo, emphasizing the distinction between high-level task-space trajectories and their low-level articulatory execution. We then present simulation results for a set of CV syllables that illustrate how jaw displacement varies as a function of both place of articulation (labial, apical, dorsal) and vowel context (/a/, /i/, /u/). The model reproduces empirically attested patterns of articulatory synergy, including jaw-supported apical closures, lower-lip elevation in bilabial stops, tongue-jaw co-movement, and saturation effects in labial constrictions.

This question is increasingly relevant as a wide range of real-world user interactions involve refinement requests. However, prior studies have largely tested LMs' refinement abilities on verifiable tasks such as competition math or symbolic reasoning with simplified scaffolds, whereas users often pose open-ended queries and provide varying degrees of feedback on what they desire. The recent advent of reasoning models that exhibit self-reflection patterns in their chains-of-thought further motivates this question. To analyze this, we introduce RefineBench, a benchmark of 1,000 challenging problems across 11 domains paired with a checklist-based evaluation framework. We evaluate two refinement modes: (1) guided refinement, where an LM is provided natural language feedback, and (2) self-refinement, where LMs attempt to improve without guidance. In the self-refinement setting, even frontier LMs such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 achieve modest baseline scores of 31.3% and 29.1%, respectively, and most models fail to consistently improve across iterations (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro gains only +1.8%, while DeepSeek-R1 declines by -0.1%). By contrast, in guided refinement, both proprietary LMs and large open-weight LMs (>70B) can leverage targeted feedback to refine responses to near-perfect levels within five turns. These findings suggest that frontier LMs require breakthroughs to self-refine their incorrect responses, and that RefineBench provides a valuable testbed for tracking progress."}

Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce Focused Chain-of-Thought (F-CoT), which separates information extraction from the reasoning process. F-CoT first organizes the essential information from a query into a concise, structured context and then guides the model to reason exclusively over this context. By preventing attention to irrelevant details, F-CoT naturally produces shorter reasoning paths.

More importantly, most reinforcement learning (RL) methods in text-to-SQL leverage only the final binary execution outcome as the reward signal, a coarse-grained supervision that overlooks detailed structural and semantic errors from the perspective of rubrics. To address these challenges, we propose RuCo-C, a novel generative judge model for fine-grained, query-specific automatic evaluation using interpretable critiques without human intervention. Our framework first automatically generates query-specific evaluation rubrics for human-free annotation, linking them to interpretable critiques. Subsequently, it integrates densified reward feedback through a \"progressive exploration\" strategy during the RL training process, which dynamically adjusts the rewards to enhance the model's performance.

Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3. LED-WM features an observation encoder that uses an attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. We show that policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to other baselines in several settings in two environments: MESSENGER andthis http URLhighlight how the policy can leverage the trained world model before real-world deployment, we demonstrate the policy can be improved through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model."}

Speculative Decoding (SPD) mitigates this issue by verifying candidate tokens in parallel from a smaller draft model, yet its strict exact-match verification discards many semantically valid continuations. Moreover, existing training-based SPD methods often suffer from performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. To this end, we propose Training-Free Loosely Speculative Decoding (FLy), a novel method that loosens the rigid verification criterion by leveraging the target model's self-corrective behavior to judge whether a draft-target mismatch remains semantically valid. FLy introduces a two-tier mechanism: an entropy-level gate that identifies whether the current token allows multiple plausible alternatives or is nearly deterministic, and a token-level deferred window that distinguishes genuine errors from differently worded yet semantically correct variants. To further reduce latency, we design a multi-level acceleration strategy that accelerates not only the target model but also the drafter itself. Owing to its training-free design, FLy composes seamlessly with arbitrary draft-target pairs and generalizes across models and domains without hyperparameter re-tuning. Experiments show that FLy preserves more than 99% of the target model's accuracy while achieving an average 2.81x speedup on Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and 5.07x speedup on the 405B variant.

For this purpose we introduce PSP, a dataset built specifically to probe the refusal behaviors in LLMs from an explicitly political context. PSP is built by formatting existing censored content from two data sources, openly available on the internet: sensitive prompts in China generalized to multiple countries, and tweets that have been censored in various countries. We study: 1) impact of political sensitivity in seven LLMs through data-driven (making PSP implicit) and representation-level approaches (erasing the concept of politics); and, 2) vulnerability of models on PSP through prompt injection attacks (PIAs). Associating censorship with refusals on content with masked implicit intent, we find that most LLMs perform some form of censorship. We conclude with summarizing major attributes that can cause a shift in refusal distributions across models and contexts of different countries."}

To enable this, we propose a lightweight three-stage training framework that learns a single prompt-specific Behavior-Equivalent token ([BE]). The framework first trains [BE] to encode the natural-language content of the original system prompt via reconstruction, and then distills the prompt 's downstream behavior into this single token. Importantly, our method requires no access to model internals, no auxiliary compression models, and no labeled responses. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that a single [BE] token achieves up to a 3000x reduction in prompt length, while retaining about 98% of the downstream performance of the original system prompts.

Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation on the RotoWireFG dataset and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation on the KdConv dataset.

While fine-tuning is effective for adapting these multimodal language models (MLMs) to downstream tasks, full fine-tuning is computationally expensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by training only a small portion of model weights. However, MLMs are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to identify which components are most effective for training to balance efficiency and performance. We propose an attention-based interpretability method for MLMs by analyzing attention scores relative to image tokens. The core idea is to identify attention heads that focus on image key objects. We utilize this information to select optimal model components for PEFT in multimodal models. Our contributions include a method for identifying attention heads associated with image key objects, its application to PEFT for image captioning, and the creation of a new dataset containing images, key object masks, and their textual descriptions. We conducted experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters to validate the method's effectiveness. By calculating Head Impact (HI) scores we quantify an attention head's focus on key objects, indicating its significance in image understanding. Our fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that adapting layers with the highest HI scores leads to the most significant shifts in metrics compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers. This indicates that fine-tuning a small percentage (around 0.01%) of parameters in these crucial layers can substantially influence image understanding capabilities."}

However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios.

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks."}

Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: *one-query-per-CTA* execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while *one-size-fits-all* tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 67.4% on average and TPOT by 13.6-83.4% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels."}

While regularisation and replay perform well in vision, they lag behind multi-task learning for large language models (LLMs), especially at scale with many tasks. We revisit replay and argue that two failure modes drive this gap: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge). To address selection, we propose Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe), a simple, architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores the most surprising (high Negative Log-Likelihood) sequences. SuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting and delivers the best overall average across both Standard CL and LNT benchmarks. To address integration, we add a dual-learner design with fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via an exponential moving average (EMA), enabling rapid adaptation while stabilising long-term knowledge. Combining SuRe with the dual learner yields further gains, including improvements of up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our proposed method remains robust under reduced replay frequency and small buffer size, demonstrating both effectiveness and sample efficiency. Taken together, our results establish replay as a strong baseline for continual LLM fine-tuning and demonstrate that surprise-based selection and slow-weight consolidation are complementary components for mitigating catastrophic forgetting."}

There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking."}

By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier.

However, existing cloud-edge inference approaches apply uniform privacy protection without considering input sensitivity, resulting in unnecessary perturbation and degraded utility even for non-sensitive tokens. To address this limitation, we propose Privacy-aware Routing for Inference with Semantic Modulation (PRISM), a context-aware framework that dynamically balances privacy and inference quality. PRISM executes in four stages: (1) the edge device profiles entity-level sensitivity; (2) a soft gating module on the edge selects an execution mode - cloud, edge, or collaboration; (3) for collaborative paths, the edge applies adaptive two-layer local differential privacy based on entity risks; and (4) the cloud LLM generates a semantic sketch from the perturbed prompt, which is then refined by the edge-side small language model (SLM) using local context. Our results show that PRISM consistently achieves superior privacy-utility trade-offs across various scenarios, reducing energy consumption and latency to 40-50% of baseline methods such as Uniform and Selective LDP, while maintaining high output quality under strong privacy constraints.

We present BanglaSentNet, an explainable hybrid deep learning framework integrating LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BanglaBERT through dynamic weighted ensemble learning for multi-aspect sentiment classification. We introduce a dataset of 8,755 manually annotated Bangla product reviews across four aspects (Quality, Service, Price, Decoration) from major Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms. Our framework incorporates SHAP-based feature attribution and attention visualization for transparent insights. BanglaSentNet achieves 85% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming standalone deep learning models by 3-7% and traditional approaches substantially. The explainability suite achieves 9.4/10 interpretability score with 87.6% human agreement. Cross-domain transfer learning experiments reveal robust generalization: zero-shot performance retains 67-76% effectiveness across diverse domains (BanglaBook reviews, social media, general e-commerce, news headlines); few-shot learning with 500-1000 samples achieves 90-95% of full fine-tuning performance, significantly reducing annotation costs. Real-world deployment demonstrates practical utility for Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms, enabling data-driven decision-making for pricing optimization, service improvement, and customer experience enhancement. This research establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for Bangla sentiment analysis, advances ensemble learning methodologies for low-resource languages, and provides actionable solutions for commercial applications."}

Recognizing limitations in previous unimodal approaches, we systematically benchmark transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet), utilizing the Uddessho dataset of 3,048 posts spanning six practical intent categories. We introduce a novel intermediate fusion strategy that significantly outperforms early and late fusion on this task. Experimental results show that intermediate fusion, particularly with mBERT and Swin Transformer, achieves 84.11% macro-F1 score, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an 8.4 percentage-point improvement over prior Bangla multimodal approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that integrating visual context substantially enhances intent classification.

In this paper, we first identify causes of the above interference, and hypothesize that correlations between data representations are a key factor of interference. We then propose a method for promoting appropriate correlations between arbitrary tasks' data representations (i.e., global alignment) in individual task learning. Specifically, we learn the data representation as a task-specific composition of pre-trained token representations shared across all tasks. Then the correlations between different tasks' data representations are grounded by correlations between pre-trained token representations. We explore different ways to learn such compositions.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), can enhance simulated patients by replicating medical conditions and doctor patient interactions with high fidelity and at low cost, but effectiveness and trustworthiness remain open challenges. Methods: We developed AIPatient, a simulated patient system powered by LLM based AI agents. The system uses a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) framework with six task specific agents for complex reasoning. To improve realism, it is linked to the AIPatient knowledge graph built from de identified real patient data in the MIMIC III intensive care database. Results: We evaluated electronic health record (EHR) based medical question answering (QA), readability, robustness, stability, and user experience. AIPatient reached 94.15 percent QA accuracy when all six agents were enabled, outperforming versions with partial or no agent integration. The knowledge base achieved an F1 score of 0.89. Readability scores showed a median Flesch Reading Ease of 68.77 and a median Flesch Kincaid Grade of 6.4, indicating accessibility for most medical trainees and clinicians. Robustness and stability were supported by non significant variance in repeated trials (analysis of variance F value 0.61, p greater than 0.1; F value 0.78, p greater than 0.1).

Inspired by Benford's Law, a statistical pattern in which lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits, we hypothesize that the skewed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an evaluation benchmark in which the ground-truth digits are uniformly distributed within each of the seven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles Benford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model behavior.

We introduce the FlowerTune LLM Leaderboard, a first-of-its-kind benchmarking suite designed to evaluate federated fine-tuning of LLMs across four diverse domains: general NLP, finance, medical, and coding. Each domain includes federated instruction-tuning datasets and domain-specific evaluation metrics. Our results, obtained through a collaborative, open-source and community-driven approach, provide the first comprehensive comparison across 26 pre-trained LLMs with different aggregation and fine-tuning strategies under federated settings, offering actionable insights into model performance, resource constraints, and domain adaptation. This work lays the foundation for developing privacy-preserving, domain-specialized LLMs for real-world applications."}

This limits their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach, on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation, frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over baselines.

Based on these results, we propose Causal-Oriented Policy Optimization (COPO) to mitigate these spurious correlations, thus addressing the issue of hallucinations. It imposes token-level sufficiency and necessity constraints to measure each inference token's causal contribution, thus ensuring correct and evidence-grounded output. Specifically, we first evaluate each token's causal contribution via a newly proposed causal completeness reward. This reward is then used to construct a causally informed advantage function within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on tokens that are causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation.

To address this challenge, we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning, leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering, consistently outperforming existing strong baselines."}

Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but it is unclear where the benefit comes from. To this end, we perform a controlled study that scales the vocabulary of the language model from 24K to 196K while holding data, computation, and optimization unchanged. We begin by quantifying the complexity of tokenized text -- formalized via Kolmogorov complexity -- and show that larger vocabularies reduce this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already tokenized as a single token, so enlarging vocabulary only deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. Word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce cross-entropy loss almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. The same frequent words cover roughly 75% of tokens in downstream benchmarks, so this training advantage transfers intact. We further show that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same frequent-word benefit. Our results recast \"bigger vocabularies help\" as \"lowering complexity of tokenized text helps,\" offering a simple, principled knob for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics that govern language model scaling in pre-training."}

Parametric RAG (PRAG) encodes documents as LoRA parameters within LLMs, offering a possible way to reduce exposure of raw content. However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA, leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies solely on synthetic QA data while lacking internal alignment with standard RAG, resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore, achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally, guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without original documents.

However, these methods deteriorate in open-ended domains like medical consultation, where feedback is inherently ambiguous, highly context-dependent, and cannot be reduced to a reliable scalar signal. In such settings, RL must either rely on supervision-intensive reward models that often fail to generalize, or it falls into pathological behaviors such as reward hacking - an especially troubling risk for high-stakes medical dialogue. To address these limitations, we introduce ORBIT, an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates synthetic dialogue generation with dynamically constructed rubrics that serve as adaptive guides for incremental RL. Instead of relying on external medical knowledge bases or handcrafted rule sets, ORBIT uses rubric-driven feedback to steer the learning process. Its judge component can be instantiated with general-purpose instruction-following LLMs, removing the need for any task-specific fine-tuning. Applied to the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model, ORBIT raises the HealthBench-Hard score from 7.0 to 27.5 using only 2k training samples, achieving SOTA performance for models at this scale. With larger rubric datasets, ORBIT-trained models further compete with the strongest open-source baselines on HealthBench-Hard.

Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured, automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from 37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method across diverse domains and budget constraints."}

However, current language models often fail to reason honestly, producing unwarranted answers when the input is insufficient. To study this challenge, we formulate honest deductive reasoning as multi-step tasks where models must either derive the correct conclusion or abstain. We curate two datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that prompting and existing training methods, including GRPO with or without supervised fine-tuning initialization, struggle on these tasks. In particular, GRPO optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. To address this, we propose ACNCHOR, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling honest deductive reasoning in language models."}

Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning."}

While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we approximate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks ($+$2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing chain-of-thought reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller $\\Delta$ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first benchmarking study to systematically integrate structured prompting into an established evaluation framework, demonstrating how scalable performance-ceiling approximation yields more robust, decision-useful benchmarks.

This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model.

We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism. Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology.

To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference.

Moving beyond such introspection and inspired by core methodologies in ethology, we propose an externalist three-step framework Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR). Rather than relying on a model's introspection, DRR evaluates its observable behaviors to provide corrective feedback. DRR first distills the reasoner's behavioral traces, then trains a lightweight, external Discriminative Model (DM). At inference time, this DM acts as a critic, identifying and rejecting suspicious reasoning steps. This external feedback compels the LLM to discard flawed pathways and explore alternatives, thereby enhancing reasoning quality without altering the base model. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prominent self-critique methods.

STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance.

We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality.

However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities."}

The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score.

Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed \"PathReasoning\", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy.

In contrast, visual-prompted models achieve strong segmentation performance across diverse modalities by leveraging spatial cues of precise bounding-box (bbox) prompts to guide the segmentation of target lesions. However, it is costly and challenging to obtain the precise visual prompts in clinical practice. We propose PPBoost (Progressive Prompt-Boosting), a framework that bridges these limitations by transforming weak text-derived signals into strong, spatially grounded visual prompts, operating under a strict zero-shot regime with no image- or pixel-level segmentation labels. PPBoost first uses a vision-language model to produce initial pseudo-bboxes conditioned on the textual object descriptions and applies an uncertainty-aware criterion to filter unreliable predictions. The retained image-bboxes pairs are then leveraged to train a pseudo-labeled detector, producing the high-quality bboxes for the query images. During inference, PPBoost further refines the generated bboxes by appropriately expanding them to tightly cover the target anatomical structures. The enhanced spatially-grounding bbox prompts guide existing segmentation models to generate final dense masks, effectively amplifying weak text cues into strong spatial guidance. Across three datasets spanning diverse modalities and anatomies, PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance over text- and visual-prompted baselines and, notably, surpasses few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data. PPBoost can generalize to multiple typical visual segmentation model backbones."}

While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse. Experiments demonstrate that MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5\\% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, validating MedEyes's potential in building interpretable medical AI systems."}

These approaches typically transcribe speech to text, extract relevant object keywords, and perform grounding using models pretrained on large text-vision datasets.

Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin.

However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality.

One key threat is the prompt stealing attack, i.e., the task of recovering the textual prompt that generated a given image. Prompt stealing enables unauthorized extraction and reuse of carefully engineered prompts, yet it can also support beneficial applications such as data attribution, model provenance analysis, and watermarking validation.

To address this issue, we propose DualVLA, which enhances action performance through carefully designed post-training while still preserving reasoning capability. We first introduce a dual-layer data pruning method that removes redundant embodied reasoning, preventing it from adversely influencing action learning. To further strengthen action generation, we design a dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability. To fill the evaluation gap for generalist VLAs, we also propose VLA Score, which decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions for a more fine-grained assessment. Experiments show that DualVLA achieves an average success rate of 61.0 in SimplerEnv and an average score of 65.4 across eight competitive multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating a stronger balance between precise action execution and multimodal understanding.

To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts.

Our key innovation lies in the Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation, which decomposes B-reps into unified local units by assigning geometry to nearest half-edges and sampling their next pointers.

MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states. We evaluate our methods on the Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset, which requires predicting the agent's future 5-second trajectory in bird's-eye-view coordinates using prior camera images, agent pose history, and routing goals. We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output. Our results suggest that transformer-based methods that are used to combine the visual features along with the kinetic features such as the past trajectory features are not effective at combining both modes to produce useful scene context embeddings, even when intention embeddings are augmented with foundation-model representations of scene context from CLIP and DINOv2, but that predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single future trajectory boosts planning performance."}

Dense estimation of foot contact is crucial for accurately modeling this interaction, yet predicting dense foot contact from a single RGB image remains largely underexplored. There are two main challenges for learning dense foot contact estimation. First, shoes exhibit highly diverse appearances, making it difficult for models to generalize across different styles.

We propose test-time scaling with noise-aware pruning (TTSnap), a framework that prunes low-quality candidates without fully denoising them. The key challenge is that reward models are learned in the clean image domain, and the ranking of rewards predicted for intermediate estimates are often inconsistent with those predicted for clean images. To overcome this, we train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align the reward for intermediate estimates with that of the final clean images. To stabilize learning across different noise levels, we adopt a curriculum training strategy that progressively shifts the data domain from clean images to noise images. In addition, we introduce a new metric that measures reward alignment and computational budget utilization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves performance by over 16\\% compared with existing methods, enabling more efficient and effective test-time scaling. It also provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local test-time optimization. Code:this https URL."}

However, they still struggle with personalization, which requires adapting a pretrained model to depict user-specific subjects from only a few reference images. The key challenge lies in learning a new visual concept from a limited number of reference images while preserving the pretrained semantic prior that maintains text-image alignment. When the model focuses on subject fidelity, it tends to overfit the limited reference images and fails to leverage the pretrained distribution. Conversely, emphasizing prior preservation maintains semantic consistency but prevents the model from learning new personalized attributes. Building on these observations, we propose the personalization process through a semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. We therefore reformulate personalization as the process of learning a rare concept guided by its frequent counterpart through semantic anchoring. This anchoring encourages the model to adapt new concepts in a stable and controlled manner, expanding the pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving its semantic structure. As a result, the proposed method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed anchoring strategy."}

We trace this gap to the different behaviors in high-frequency encoding and decoding. Through controlled perturbations in both RGB and latent domains, we analyze encoder/decoder behaviors and find that decoders depend strongly on high-frequency latent components to recover details, whereas encoders under-represent high-frequency contents, yielding insufficient exposure and underfitting in high-frequency bands for diffusion model training. To address this issue, we introduce FreqWarm, a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training -- without modifying or retraining the autoencoder. Applied across several high-dimensional autoencoders, FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality: decreasing gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones.

However, can existing 3D Gaussian watermarking approaches genuinely guarantee robust protection of the 3D assets? In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore and validate possible vulnerabilities of 3DGS watermarking frameworks. We demonstrate that conventional watermark removal techniques designed for 2D images do not effectively generalize to the 3DGS scenario due to the specialized rendering pipeline and unique attributes of each gaussian primitives.

By analyzing view-dependent rendering contributions and exploiting geometrically accurate feature clustering, GSPure precisely isolates and effectively removes watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GSPure achieves the best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss.

However, directly applying VGGT to autonomous driving (AD) systems leads to sub-optimal results due to the different priors between the two tasks. In AD systems, several important new priors need to be considered: (i) The overlap between camera views is minimal, as autonomous driving sensor setups are designed to achieve coverage at a low cost. (ii) The camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known, which introduces more constraints on the output and also enables the estimation of absolute scale. (iii) Relative positions of all cameras remain fixed though the ego vehicle is in motion. To fully integrate these priors into a feed-forward framework, we propose DriveVGGT, a scale-aware 4D reconstruction framework specifically designed for autonomous driving data. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Video Attention (TVA) module to process multi-camera videos independently, which better leverages the spatiotemporal continuity within each single-camera sequence. Then, we propose a Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) module to conduct window attention with normalized relative pose embeddings, aiming to establish consistency relationships across different cameras while restricting each token to attend only to nearby frames. Finally, we extend the standard VGGT heads by adding an absolute scale head and an ego vehicle pose head.

Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR.

However, when the target object is small and sparse, there is a lack of objects available for training, making it more difficult to learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for detecting a specific category of small objects; birds.

We employ Swin Transformer to upsample the image features. Moreover, we change the shifted window size for adapting to small objects.

By extracting temporal VSR features from videos, we identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. The holy grail in this context has to do with zero-shot detection, i.e., generalizable detection, which we focus on in this work. FauxNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in this setting. In addition, FauxNet is able to attribute - distinguish between generation techniques from which the videos stem. Finally, we propose new datasets, referred to as Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF, comprising about 38,000 real and fake videos in total, the latter created with six recent deepfake generation techniques. We provide extensive analysis and results on the Authentica datasets and FaceForensics++, demonstrating the superiority of FauxNet. The Authentica datasets will be made publicly available."}

However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs."}

The framework is driven by a verifier-guided search algorithm, where the search algorithm iteratively refines noise candidates based on verifier feedback. To address the inherent challenges of 3D generation, we introduce three techniques for improved stability, efficiency, and exploration capability. 1) Gaussian normalization is applied to stabilize the search process. It corrects distribution shifts when noise candidates deviate from a standard Gaussian distribution during iterative updates. 2) The high-dimensional nature of the 3D search space increases computational complexity. To mitigate this, a singular value decomposition-based compression technique is employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving effective search directions. 3) To further prevent convergence to suboptimal local minima, a singular space reset mechanism dynamically updates the search space based on diversity measures.

We solve this by separating the static background from the dynamic fire region by combining dense multi-view stereo images with monocular depth priors. The fire is initialized as a 3D flow field, obtained by fusing per-view dense optical flow projections. To capture the high frequency features of fire, each 3D Gaussian encodes a lifetime and linear velocity to match the dense optical flow. To ensure sub-frame temporal alignment across cameras we employ a custom hardware synchronization pattern -- allowing us to reconstruct fire with affordable commodity hardware.

Through systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives, we observe that DINOv3 tends to rely on global, low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues instead of high-frequency, generator-specific artifacts.

There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking."}

This challenge severely limits the deployment of AI in medical imaging, where models must continually adapt to data from new hospitals without compromising established diagnostic knowledge. To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay.

In this work, we demonstrate that unlocking the reasoning capabilities of MLLM can further push the boundaries of editing models. Specifically, we explore two reasoning mechanisms, thinking and reflection, which enhance instruction understanding and editing accuracy.

The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance."}

Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods typically rely on fixed, shared prompts and deterministic parameters, which limits their ability to capture instance-level variation or model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that enables sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. VaMP generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution, allowing the model to personalize its behavior based on input content. To further enhance the integration of local and global semantics, we introduce a class-aware prior derived from the instance representation and class prototype. Building upon these, we formulate prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations and train the entire framework end-to-end through reparameterized sampling. Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show that VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure in our method.

Among these, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) and its variants stand out for their impressive performance, which is widely attributed to their core mechanism of matching the student's output distribution to that of a pre-trained teacher model. In this work, we challenge this conventional understanding. Through a rigorous decomposition of the DMD training objective, we reveal that in complex tasks like text-to-image generation, where CFG is typically required for desirable few-step performance, the primary driver of few-step distillation is not distribution matching, but a previously overlooked component we identify as CFG Augmentation (CA). We demonstrate that this term acts as the core ``engine'' of distillation, while the Distribution Matching (DM) term functions as a ``regularizer'' that ensures training stability and mitigates artifacts. We further validate this decoupling by demonstrating that while the DM term is a highly effective regularizer, it is not unique; simpler non-parametric constraints or GAN-based objectives can serve the same stabilizing function, albeit with different trade-offs. This decoupling of labor motivates a more principled analysis of the properties of both terms, leading to a more systematic and in-depth understanding. This new understanding further enables us to propose principled modifications to the distillation process, such as decoupling the noise schedules for the engine and the regularizer, leading to further performance gains.

Gaussian Splatting has shown its promising potential in rendering tasks, but it typically necessitates per-scene optimization with dense input views. Although some recent approaches achieve feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering through geometry priors obtained by multi-view stereo, such approaches still require largely overlapped input views to establish the geometry prior. To bridge this gap, we leverage pixel-wise point map reconstruction to represent geometry which is robust to large sparsity for its independent view modeling. In general, we propose a two-stage learning strategy. In stage 1, we transform the point map into real space via an iterative affinity learning process, which facilitates camera control in the following. In stage 2, we project point maps of two input views onto the target view plane and refine such geometry via stereo matching. Furthermore, we anchor Gaussian primitives on this refined plane in order to render high-quality images. As a metric representation, the scale-aware point map in stage 1 is trained in a self-supervised manner without 3D supervision and stage 2 is supervised with photo-metric loss. We collect multi-view human-centered data and demonstrate that our method improves both the stability of point map reconstruction and the visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering."}

Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets.

Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar.

The combination of remote sensing, aerial imagery and deep learning offer promising opportunities to renew or improve existing survey methods. The complementary use of visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can add information compared to a single-source image and improve results in an automated detection context. However, the alignment and fusion process can be challenging, especially since visible and thermal images usually have different fields of view (FOV) and spatial resolutions. This research presents a case study on the great blue heron (Ardea herodias) to evaluate the performances of synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery to automatically detect individuals and nests using a YOLO11n model. Two VIS-TIR fusion methods were tested and compared: an early fusion approach and a late fusion approach, to determine if the addition of the TIR image gives any added value compared to a VIS-only model. VIS and TIR images were automatically aligned using a deep learning model. A principal component analysis fusion method was applied to VIS-TIR image pairs to form the early fusion dataset. A classification and regression tree was used to process the late fusion dataset, based on the detection from the VIS-only and TIR-only trained models. Across all classes, both late and early fusion improved the F1 score compared to the VIS-only model. For the main class, occupied nest, the late fusion improved the F1 score from 90.2 (VIS-only) to 93.0%. This model was also able to identify false positives from both sources with 90% recall. Although fusion methods seem to give better results, this approach comes with a limiting TIR FOV and alignment constraints that eliminate data.

To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines. More importantly, in a 50-participant, 5-way human study where annotators select the best result among five anonymized models, 67.6% of preferences favor our method across all axes. Our results demonstrate that pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation and provide OpenSafari as a challenging new benchmark for future world-engine research."}

Building on these findings, we propose a modality alignment tuning strategy to teach the model when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that our alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding.

To address these limitations, we propose SLEUTH, a multi agent framework. Concretely, SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse to fine process. The framework identifies key textual and visual clues within the retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence such as tables and charts, and analyzes the query to devise a reasoning strategy. It ultimately synthesizes a distilled, evidence dense multimodal context to generate the final prediction. SLEUTH is model agnostic and scalable. When paired with advanced VLM backbones, it consistently improves performance on multiple long document benchmarks, achieving state of the art results.

Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments."}

Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing.

However, current MPL methods are fundamentally limited by their optimization of a single, static point representation. This paradigm is inherently brittle, leads to overfitting on base classes, and generalizes poorly to novel or ambiguous categories. We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines. On the base-to-novel generalization benchmark, our method achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7%, representing a relative improvement of 1.4% over the baseline.

In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning.

We introduce SolarCHIP, a family of contrastively pretrained visual backbones tailored to multi-instrument SDO observations. SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. We train both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders and demonstrate their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet, and full-disk flare classification. Experimental results show that SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm that each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities. By publicly releasing pretrained weights and training code, we provide the heliophysics community with a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications."}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions. The text descriptions capture spatial relationships by referencing the 3D coordinates of detected objects, while the multi-view images include a top-down perspective and four directional views (forward, left, right, and backward), ensuring comprehensive scene coverage. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical feature representation that aggregates patch-level image features into view-level and scene-level representations, enabling the model to reason over both local and global scene context.

To achieve illumination invariance, we propose a novel semantic SLAM framework with two designs. First, the Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module proactively disentangles the scene's intrinsic properties, such as albedo, from transient lighting. By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions. The synergy between IAN's proactive invariance and DRB-Loss's reactive correction endows our system with unprecedented robustness.

Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment.

This method works without the need for re-training, specific conditions, or any architectural modifications. It achieves this by constructing a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. We theoretically show that invertible spectral transformations preserve information, while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum introduces controlled information reduction. Based on this insight, we perform spectrum selection along the channel dimension of internal representations, which avoids the structural constraints imposed by diffusion models. We further introduce two spectrum renormalization strategies that ensures numerical stability during the weakening process.

Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to \"get the right answer for the right visual reason\".

This paper presents GC-4DGS, a novel framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), offering real-time and high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views. While learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and monocular depth estimators (MDEs) provide geometry priors, directly integrating these with 4DGS yields suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-input 4D geometric optimization. To address these problems, we introduce a dynamic consistency checking strategy to reduce estimation uncertainties of MVS across spacetime. Furthermore, we propose a global-local depth regularization approach to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths, thereby enhancing the coherent geometry and appearance learning within the 4D volume. Extensive experiments on the popular N3DV and Technicolor datasets validate the effectiveness of GC-4DGS in rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency.

This allows us to partition mesh faces into ordered visibility layers, from outermost to innermost. We then apply a two-stage visibility control strategy that progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, followed by texturing each layer using a pretrained diffusion model.

Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations.

Its performance was verified by conducting skin lesion detection experiments using images of skin lesions taken by actual users. Its accuracy and response time were measured using randomly sampled skin disease images. Results revealed that ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and less than 1s s processing speed. This study contributes to the objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes the advancement of digital healthcare."}

To address this, we present MathSight, a university-level multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark designed to disentangle and quantify the effect of visual input.

Experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent trend: the contribution of visual information diminishes with increasing problem difficulty.

The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets.

However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models.

We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image.

Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives."}

Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings."}

This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density.

This motivates us to develop a new VAR model with better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency. To address this, we reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process, proposing Markov-VAR. It is achieved via Markovian Scale Prediction: we treat each scale as a Markov state and introduce a sliding window that compresses certain previous scales into a compact history vector to compensate for historical information loss owing to non-full-context dependency. Integrating the history vector with the Markov state yields a representative dynamic state that evolves under a Markov process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Markov-VAR is extremely simple yet highly effective: Compared to VAR on ImageNet, Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% (256 $\\times$ 256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024 $\\times$ 1024).

In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer.

This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction.

To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability. Code:this https URL"}

Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced."}

Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms that E0 delivers precise, robust, and transferable manipulation, establishing discrete diffusion as a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning."}

Meanwhile, to reduce the subjectivity of human-annotated prompts, automatic attribution-debiased prompting (ADP) is used for task adaptation on MLLMs. Additionally, we design image captioning (IC) to achieve visual details for enhancing cross-modal consistency checking.

The benchmark adopts a hierarchical task framework covering three levels of reasoning complexity and defines seven atomic capabilities essential for resolving cross-modal inconsistencies. CrossCheck-Bench includes 15k question-answer pairs sourced from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected contradictions. The dataset is constructed through a multi-stage annotation pipeline involving more than 450 expert hours to ensure semantic validity and calibrated difficulty across perception, integration, and reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models and observe a consistent performance drop as tasks shift from perceptual matching to logical contradiction detection. Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Capability-level analysis further reveals uneven skill acquisition, especially in tasks requiring multi-step inference or rule-based validation. Additional probing shows that conventional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Set-of-Mark yield only marginal gains.

The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training."}

We identify this open-loop bottleneck as a fundamental architectural limitation underlying well-documented failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning. To address this limitation, we introduce the closed-loop prediction principle, which requires that models iteratively refine latent representations until reaching a self-consistent equilibrium before committing to each token. We instantiate this principle as Equilibrium Transformers (EqT), which augment standard transformer layers with an Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes a learned energy function via gradient descent in latent space. The energy function enforces bidirectional prediction consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence, all computed without external supervision. Theoretically, we prove that EqT performs approximate MAP inference in a latent energy-based model, establish linear convergence guarantees, and show that refinement improves predictions precisely on hard instances where one-shot inference is suboptimal. The framework unifies deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training as special cases. Preliminary experiments on the binary parity task demonstrate +3.28% average improvement on challenging sequences, with gains reaching +8.07% where standard transformers approach random performance, validating that the benefit of deliberation scales with task difficulty. Just as attention mechanisms resolved the sequential bottleneck of recurrent networks, we propose that closed-loop equilibrium may resolve the commitment bottleneck of open-loop autoregression, representing a foundational step toward language models."}

While SAM 2 is widely used for annotation in 3D medical workflows, SAM 3 introduces a new perception backbone, detector-tracker pipeline, and concept-level prompting that may alter its behavior under spatial prompts. We present the first controlled comparison of SAM 2 and SAM 3 for zero-shot segmentation of 3D medical volumes and videos under purely visual prompting, with concept mechanisms disabled. We assess whether SAM 3 can serve as an out-of-the-box replacement for SAM 2 without customization. We benchmark both models on 16 public datasets (CT, MRI, 3D and cine ultrasound, endoscopy) covering 54 anatomical structures, pathologies, and surgical instruments. Prompts are restricted to the first frame and use four modes: single-click, multi-click, bounding box, and dense mask. This design standardizes preprocessing, prompt placement, propagation rules, and metric computation to disentangle prompt interpretation from propagation. Prompt-frame analysis shows that SAM 3 provides substantially stronger initialization than SAM 2 for click prompting across most structures. In full-volume analysis, SAM 3 retains this advantage for complex, vascular, and soft-tissue anatomies, emerging as the more versatile general-purpose segmenter. While SAM 2 remains competitive for compact, rigid organs under strong spatial guidance, it frequently fails on challenging targets where SAM 3 succeeds. Overall, our results suggest that SAM 3 is the superior default choice for most medical segmentation tasks, particularly those involving sparse user interaction or complex anatomical topology."}

We first developed a global dataset consisting of 12K RGB-DEM pairs using Landsat satellite imagery and NASA's SRTM digital elevation data, both from the year 2000. A unique preprocessing pipeline was implemented to select high-quality, cloud-free regions and aggregate normalized RGB composites from Landsat imagery. Additionally, the model was trained in a two-stage process, where it was first trained on the complete dataset and then fine-tuned on high-quality samples filtered by Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values to improve performance on challenging terrains. The results demonstrate promising performance in mountainous regions, achieving an overall mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.4671 and a mean SSIM score of 0.2065 (scale -1 to 1), while highlighting limitations in lowland and residential areas.

A Systematic Evaluation Across Retinal Imaging Tasks", "abstract": "Large vision foundation models have been widely adopted for retinal disease classification without systematic evidence justifying their parameter requirements. In the present work we address two critical questions: First, are large domain-specific foundation models essential, or do compact general-purpose architectures suffice? Second, does specialized retinal pretraining justify its computational cost? To answer this, we benchmark initialization strategies across four retinal imaging classification tasks spanning Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Color Fundus Photography (CFP) modalities: 8-class OCT classification, 3-class diabetic macular edema (DME), 5-class diabetic retinopathy (DR), and 3-class glaucoma (GL) detection. We evaluate 12-13 model configurations per task, including vision transformers (22.8M-86.6M parameters), Swin Transformers (27.6M-28.3M), ConvNeXt (28.6M), and the domain-specific RETFound models (303M), under identical training conditions. Our results challenge prevailing assumptions: First, we demonstrate that pretraining provides universal benefits (5.18-18.41% improvement), scaling with task difficulty. Second, compact architectures (27-29M) dominate Pareto frontiers; SwinV2-tiny achieves top-1 performance on three datasets. Third, RETFound (303M) justifies its computational cost only for challenging DR grading (accuracy of 71.15%), while ImageNet pretraining proves to be sufficient with all other tasks (DME accuracy: 99.24%, OCT accuracy: 97.96%). CFP tasks show larger pretraining accuracy gains (9.13-18.41%) than OCT (5.18%). Thus, the evidence suggests that compact general-purpose models deliver near-optimal performance for most retinal classification tasks; specialized foundation models warranted only for fine-grained discrimination under extreme class imbalance."}

However, there is no guarantee that these scores lead to meaningful rankings and no guarantee that the rankings are good tradeoffs between these base scores. Given the ubiquity of $F_\\beta$ scores in the literature, some clarification is in order. Concretely: (1) We establish that $F_\\beta$-induced rankings are meaningful and define a shortest path between precision- and recall-induced rankings. (2) We frame the problem of finding a tradeoff between two scores as an optimization problem expressed with Kendall rank correlations. We show that $F_1$ and its skew-insensitive version are far from being optimal in that regard. (3) We provide theoretical tools and a closed-form expression to find the optimal value for $\\beta$ for any distribution or set of performances, and we illustrate their use on six case studies."}

Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages.

This imprecision poses significant risks for stereotactic radiosurgery planning. To address this, we introduce the Spatial Gating Network (SG-Net), a precision-first architecture employing hard spatial gating mechanisms. Unlike traditional soft attention, SG-Net enforces strict feature selection to aggressively suppress background artifacts while preserving tumor features. Validated on the Brain-Mets-Lung-MRI dataset (n=92), SG-Net achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.5578 +/- 0.0243 (95% CI: 0.45-0.67), statistically outperforming Attention U-Net (p < 0.001) and ResU-Net (p < 0.001).

Furthermore, SG-Net requires only 0.67M parameters (8.8x fewer than Attention U-Net), facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments. These findings establish hard spatial gating as a robust solution for precision-driven lesion detection, directly enhancing radiosurgery accuracy."}

Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning.

However, in multimodal scenarios, varying degrees of distribution shift across different modalities give rise to a complex coupling effect of unimodal shallow feature shift and cross-modal high-level semantic misalignment, posing a major obstacle to extending existing TTA methods to the multimodal field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment.

However, MLMs are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to identify which components are most effective for training to balance efficiency and performance. We propose an attention-based interpretability method for MLMs by analyzing attention scores relative to image tokens. The core idea is to identify attention heads that focus on image key objects. We utilize this information to select optimal model components for PEFT in multimodal models. Our contributions include a method for identifying attention heads associated with image key objects, its application to PEFT for image captioning, and the creation of a new dataset containing images, key object masks, and their textual descriptions. We conducted experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters to validate the method's effectiveness. By calculating Head Impact (HI) scores we quantify an attention head's focus on key objects, indicating its significance in image understanding. Our fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that adapting layers with the highest HI scores leads to the most significant shifts in metrics compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers.

However, solving inverse heat problems with non-invasive data collected in situ is error-prone due to environmental variability or deviations from theoretically assumed conditions. Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851.

To construct adaptive filters we have used Gabor filter family members as probing functions, but other function families can also be used to sample the spectrum, e.g., quadrature filters. A comparison to three baseline alternatives-in representation (Monogenic signal), enhancement (Monogenic signal combined with a spline-wavelet pyramid), and singularity detection (mindtct, a fingerprint minutia detector widely used in numerous studies)-is also reported using images with precisely known ground truths for location, orientation, singularity type (where applicable), and wave period."}

In this paper, we present a self-training based source-free video domain adaptation approach to address this challenge by bridging the gap between the source and the target domains. We use the source pre-trained model to generate pseudo-labels for the target domain samples, which are inevitably noisy. Thus, we treat the problem of source-free video domain adaptation as learning from noisy labels and argue that the samples with correct pseudo-labels can help us in adaptation. To this end, we leverage the cross-entropy loss as an indicator of the correctness of the pseudo-labels and use the resulting small-loss samples from the target domain for fine-tuning the model. We further enhance the adaptation performance by implementing a teacher-student (TS) framework, in which the teacher, which is updated gradually, produces reliable pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, the student undergoes fine-tuning on the target domain videos using these generated pseudo-labels to improve its performance. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our methods, termed as CleanAdapt, CleanAdapt + TS, achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming the existing approaches on various open datasets.

As it is hard to well mathematically define the fused image without ground truth, the performance of existing fusion methods is limited. In this paper, we propose to use natural language to express the objective of IVIF, which can avoid the explicit mathematical modeling of fusion output in current losses, and make full use of the advantage of language expression to improve the fusion performance. For this purpose, we present a comprehensive language-expressed fusion objective, and encode relevant texts into the multi-modal embedding space using CLIP. A language-driven fusion model is then constructed in the embedding space, by establishing the relationship among the embedded vectors representing the fusion objective and input image modalities. Finally, a language-driven loss is derived to make the actual IVIF aligned with the embedded language-driven fusion model via supervised training.

Second, their performance is sub-optimal due to limitations in dataset coverage, scale, and quality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the enhanced Depicted image Quality Assessment model (DepictQA-Wild).

In this work, we systematically investigate the limitation of the recently proposed Active Passive Loss (APL), which employs Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as its passive loss function. Despite the robustness brought by MAE, one of its key drawbacks is that it pays equal attention to clean and noisy samples; this feature slows down convergence and potentially makes training difficult, particularly in large-scale datasets. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel loss function class, termed Normalized Negative Loss Functions (NNLFs), which serve as passive loss functions within the APL framework. NNLFs effectively address the limitations of MAE by concentrating more on memorized clean samples. By replacing MAE in APL with our proposed NNLFs, we enhance APL and present a new framework called Active Negative Loss (ANL).

A key challenge is that the quality score is inherently continuous, typically modeled as a Gaussian distribution, whereas MLLMs generate discrete token outputs. This mismatch necessitates score discretization. Previous approaches discretize the mean score into a one-hot label, resulting in information loss and failing to capture inter-image relationships. We propose a distribution-based approach that discretizes the score distribution into a soft label. This method preserves the characteristics of the score distribution, achieving high accuracy and maintaining inter-image relationships.

The challenge started with a training phase, where teams received 78 sets of MRI scans from 34 patients, consisting of both diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans. The final test phase, consisting of 18 MRI sets from 9 patients, determined the ranking of the teams. Ranking was based on the Dice similarity coefficient (Dice score), the 95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (HD95) and the volumetric similarity (VS). The SPPIN challenge was hosted at MICCAI 2023. The final leaderboard consisted of 9 teams. The highest-ranking team achieved a median Dice score 0.82, a median HD95 of 7.69 mm and a VS of 0.91, utilizing a large, pretrained network called STU-Net.

Asian countries such as China, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia are notable for their significant contribution to the cultivation and utilization of rice.

These sizes are further classified as basmati, jasmine, kainat saila, ipsala, arborio, etc., catering to diverse culinary preferences and cultural traditions. For both local and international trade, inspecting and maintaining the quality of rice grains to satisfy customers and preserve a country's reputation is necessary. Manual quality check and classification is quite a laborious and time-consuming process. It is also highly prone to mistakes. Therefore, an automatic solution must be proposed for the effective and efficient classification of different varieties of rice grains. This research paper presents an automatic framework based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying different varieties of rice grains. We evaluated the proposed model based on performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score. The CNN model underwent rigorous training and validation, achieving a remarkable accuracy rate and a perfect area under each class's Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The confusion matrix analysis confirmed the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between the different rice varieties, indicating minimal misclassifications. Additionally, the integration of explainability techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) provided valuable insights into the model's decision-making process, revealing how specific features of the rice grains influenced classification outcomes."}

However, suboptimal semantic flow within current architectures can hinder this potential: features encoding the richest high-level semantics are underutilized and diluted when propagating through decoding layers, impeding the formation of an explicit semantic bottleneck layer. To address this, we introduce self-conditioning, a lightweight mechanism that reshapes the model's layer-wise semantic hierarchy without external guidance. By aggregating and rerouting intermediate features to guide subsequent decoding layers, our method concentrates more high-level semantics, concurrently strengthening global generative guidance and forming more discriminative representations. This simple approach yields a dual-improvement trend across pixel-space UNet, UViT and latent-space DiT models with minimal overhead. Crucially, it creates an architectural semantic bridge that propagates discriminative improvements into generation and accommodates further techniques such as contrastive self-distillation. Experiments show that our enhanced models, especially self-conditioned DiT, are powerful dual learners that yield strong and transferable representations on image and dense classification tasks, surpassing various generative self-supervised models in linear probing while also improving or maintaining high generation quality."}

The authors of these studies compared their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a polygonal approximation was the figure of merit. Later,it was noted that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason which is why Rosin-through mathematical analysis-introduced a measure called merit. However,this measure involves an optimal scheme of polygonal approximation,so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness of fit of an approximation. This led many researchers to use a weighted figure of merit as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare sub optimal schemes. An attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures-weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure-are related so that one can be used instead of the other, and toward this end, theoretical analysis, experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The mathematical formulas for the weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are analyzed, and through proof of theorems,it is found that the two measures are theoretically independent of each other. The graphical analysis of experiments carried out using a public dataset supports the results of the theoretical analysis. The statistical analysis via Pearson's correlation coefficient and non-linear correlation measure also revealed that the two measures are uncorrelated.

However, the absence of a large-scale and richly annotated dataset severely hinders progress. In this paper, we build OpenDanceSet, an extensive human dance dataset comprising over 100 hours across 14 genres and 147 subjects.

Furthermore, we propose OpenDanceNet, a unified masked modeling framework for controllable dance generation, including a disentangled auto-encoder and a multimodal joint-prediction Transformer. OpenDanceNet supports generation conditioned on music and arbitrary combinations of text, keypoints, or trajectories.

Modern vision-language encoders such as CLIP and SigLIP are trained with contrastive objectives that implicitly optimize log density ratios between joint and marginal image-text distributions, which implicitly learn similarity scores proportional to log density ratios. However, prior work has largely focused on their embedding utility, and the density-ratio structure induced by contrastive learning has not been systematically examined or exploited in multimodal applications. To address this gap, we reinterpret CLIP-style models as pretrained and general-purpose density ratio estimators and show that this perspective enables new algorithmic capabilities. We present a unified explanation of how contrastive objectives estimate density ratios and propose two practical applications: Importance Weight Learning and KL divergence estimation. Our Importance Weight Learning method requires only a single additional prompt and improves F1 scores by up to 7 points. We further show that CLIP-based density ratios support estimation of KL divergences that quantify how conditioning on an image or text alters the distribution of the other modality. Through qualitative examples and an N-gram analysis of captions, we find that these divergences capture semantic diversity and mode structure in multimodal data. Leveraging this property, we introduce a simple KL-guided data curation method that achieves performance competitive with LAION2B filtering."}

Motivated by the recent success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen self-supervised video models trained only to predict future frames can be prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior attempts to read out depth or illumination from video generators required fine-tuning; that strategy is ill-suited for flow, where labeled data is scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm, which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we extend this idea to generative video models for zero-shot flow extraction. We explore several popular architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely present in the recently introduced Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture. Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time inference procedure that injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning, our method is competitive with state-of-the-art, task-specific models on the real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS benchmark and the synthetic TAP-Vid Kubric. Our results show that counterfactual prompting of controllable generative video models is an effective alternative to supervised or photometric-loss methods for high-quality flow."}

We isolate three distinct forms of nonlocal vision: comparative perception, which demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves following a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4), even those that perform well on prior primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans.

However, parallel inference introduces significant communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices, limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations, saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information. To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On 4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.

To address these limitations, we introduce CADAR, a neuro-symbolic framework for cognitive attack detection in AR that integrates neural and symbolic reasoning. CADAR fuses multimodal vision-language representations from pre-trained models into a perception graph that captures objects, relations, and temporal contextual salience. Building on this structure, a particle-filter-based statistical reasoning module infers anomalies in semantic dynamics to reveal cognitive attacks.

EASI is an ongoing community effort: we have open-sourced the EASI codebase that provides a one-stop and reproducible solution with standardized interfaces, integrated protocols and prompts that significantly reduce the friction of configuring and running multiple benchmarks; we have also launched an accompanying EASI leaderboard to provide a continually updated snapshot of model performance across the full SI spectrum, accelerating collective progress toward robust SI."}

Current state-of-the-art methods learn a single, entangled forgery representation, conflating content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts, and are further constrained by outdated benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniAID, a novel framework centered on a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The core of our method is a hybrid expert system designed to decouple: (1) semantic flaws across distinct content domains, and (2) content-dependent flaws from content-agnostic universal artifacts. This system employs a set of Routable Specialized Semantic Experts, each for a distinct domain (e.g., human, animal), complemented by a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert. This architecture is trained using a novel two-stage strategy: we first train the experts independently with domain-specific hard-sampling to ensure specialization, and subsequently train a lightweight gating network for effective input routing. By explicitly decoupling \"what is generated\" (content-specific flaws) from \"how it is generated\" (universal artifacts), OmniAID achieves robust generalization. To address outdated benchmarks and validate real-world applicability, we introduce Mirage, a new large-scale, contemporary dataset. Extensive experiments, using both traditional benchmarks and our Mirage dataset, demonstrate our model surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new and robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern, in-the-wild threats."}

Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code."}

Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, i.e., response intervals or temporal delays with which agents respond to various trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to a specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of forecasting systems, leading to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by reverberation in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which predicts both individual latency preferences and their stochastic variations accordingly, by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, enabling latency-conditioned and controllable trajectory prediction of both non-interactive and social latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach."}

This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference.

No worries! How synthetic images can alleviate image scarcity in wildlife surveys: a case study with muskox (Ovibos moschatus)", "abstract": "Accurate population estimates are essential for wildlife management, providing critical insights into species abundance and distribution. Traditional survey methods, including visual aerial counts and GNSS telemetry tracking, are widely used to monitor muskox populations in Arctic regions. These approaches are resource intensive and constrained by logistical challenges. Advances in remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and high resolution aerial imagery offer promising alternatives for wildlife detection. Yet, the effectiveness of deep learning object detection models (ODMs) is often limited by small datasets, making it challenging to train robust ODMs for sparsely distributed species like muskoxen. This study investigates the integration of synthetic imagery (SI) to supplement limited training data and improve muskox detection in zero shot (ZS) and few-shot (FS) settings. We compared a baseline model trained on real imagery with 5 ZS and 5 FS models that incorporated progressively more SI in the training set. For the ZS models, where no real images were included in the training set, adding SI improved detection performance. As more SI were added, performance in precision, recall and F1 score increased, but eventually plateaued, suggesting diminishing returns when SI exceeded 100% of the baseline model training dataset. For FS models, combining real and SI led to better recall and slightly higher overall accuracy compared to using real images alone, though these improvements were not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SI to train accurate ODMs when data is scarce, offering important perspectives for wildlife monitoring by enabling rare or inaccessible species to be monitored and to increase monitoring frequency. This approach could be used to initiate ODMs without real data and refine it as real images are acquired over time."}

To address this, we propose Hierarchically Guided Fine-grained Augmentation (HiGFA). HiGFA leverages the temporal dynamics of the diffusion sampling process. It employs strong text and transformed contour guidance with fixed strengths in the early-to-mid sampling stages to establish overall scene, style, and structure. In the final sampling stages, HiGFA activates a specialized fine-grained classifier guidance and dynamically modulates the strength of all guidance signals based on prediction confidence. This hierarchical, confidence-driven orchestration enables HiGFA to generate diverse yet faithful synthetic images by intelligently balancing global structure formation with precise detail refinement.

Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a \"produce-refine-evaluate\" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects."}

Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation."}

Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance.

Moreover, they lack specialized strategies to handle frequently occluded regions (e.g., mouth interiors, eyelids). To address these limitations, we propose STAvatar, which consists of two key components: (1) a UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that leverages both image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets within the UV space. This UV representation supports dynamic resampling, ensuring full compatibility with Adaptive Density Control (ADC) and enhanced adaptability to shape and textural variations. (2) a Temporal ADC strategy, which first clusters structurally similar frames to facilitate more targeted computation of the densification criterion. It further introduces a novel fused perceptual error as clone criterion to jointly capture geometric and textural discrepancies, encouraging densification in regions requiring finer details.

Our systematic investigations across multiple post-trained LMMs suggest that RLVR shifts low-entropy activations unexpectedly, while high-entropy ones are less affected. We further demonstrate that such phenomena are associated with LMM reasoning by controlled experiments, suggesting a potentially beneficial role of modulating low-entropy activations. To this end, we propose Activation Replay, a novel simple yet effective training-free approach that boosts multimodal reasoning of post-trained LMMs without requiring expensive policy optimization. Our design involves manipulation of visual tokens at test time, replaying low-entropy activations from the input context of base LMMs to regulating the RLVR counterparts. Activation Replay triggers better reasoning across diverse scenarios, including mathematics, o3-like visual agents, and video reasoning. We further show that Activation Replay boosts Pass@K and mitigates narrower reasoning coverage of RLVR.

We introduce SKEL-CF, a coarse-to-fine framework for SKEL parameter estimation. SKEL-CF employs a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder predicts coarse camera and SKEL parameters, and the decoder progressively refines them in successive layers.

A naive approach (which is highly not recommended) would be to perform the global reconstruction of a higher resolution image, which has two major limitations: first, it is computationally inefficient, and second, the image regularization is still applied globally, which may over-smooth some local regions. Furthermore, if one wishes to fine-tune the regularization parameter for local parts, it would be computationally infeasible in practice for the case of using global reconstruction. Our new iterative approaches for such tasks are based on jointly utilizing the measurement information, efficient up-sampling/down-sampling across image spaces, and locally adjusted image prior for efficient and high-quality post-processing. The numerical results in low-dose X-ray CT image local zoom-in demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

Instead of fine-tuning, we tackle this challenge from a sampling-based perspective using frozen, pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we demonstrate that arbitrary out-of-domain (OOD) images establish Gaussian priors in the latent spaces of a given model after inversion, and that these priors are separable from those of the original training domain. This OOD latent property allows us to synthesize new images of the target unseen domain by discovering qualified OOD latent encodings in the inverted noisy spaces, without altering the pre-trained models. Our cross-model and cross-domain experiments show that the proposed sampling-based method can expand the latent space and generate unseen images without impairing the generation quality of the original domain. We also showcase a practical application of our approach using astrophysical data, highlighting the potential of this generalization paradigm in data-sparse fields such as scientific exploration."}

This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps.

We resolve this through a unified optimization framework where physics simulation guides Score Distillation to jointly refine the motion prior for photorealism while simultaneously optimizing appearance. Specifically, we learn a neural dynamics model that predicts particle motion and appearance, optimized end-to-end via a combined loss integrating Video-SDS for photorealism with our physics-guidance prior. This allows for photorealistic refinements while ensuring the dynamics remain plausible. Our framework enables scene-wide dynamic weather effects, including snowfall, rainfall, fog, and sandstorms, with physically plausible motion.

However the two problems have, until recently, separately been addressed. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines network inversion with classifier training to simultaneously address both OOD detection and uncertainty estimation. For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the classifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a \"garbage\" class, initially populated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each training epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images corresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and incoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the classifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues iteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution data more closely, with a significant drop in the uncertainty, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out meaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing OOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme enables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying them into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with each prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution and OOD inputs. Our approach is scalable, interpretable, and does not require access to external OOD datasets or post-hoc calibration techniques while providing a unified solution to the dual challenges of OOD detection and uncertainty estimation."}

We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories, particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling.

This limits their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach, on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation, frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over baselines.

The proposed RegCache introduces outlier-prone yet semantically meaningless prefix tokens to the target vision encoder, which prevents other tokens from having outliers. Notably, we observe that outliers in vision encoders behave differently from those in language models, motivating two technical innovations: middle-layer prefixing and token deletion. Experiments show that our method consistently improves the accuracy of quantized models across both text-supervised and self-supervised vision encoders."}

Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in photo-realistic indoor settings.

Moreover, variable rate control has not been thoroughly explored for ICM. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free quantization strength control scheme that enables flexible bitrate adjustment. By exploiting the scale parameter predicted by the hyperprior network, the proposed method adaptively modulates quantization step sizes across both channel and spatial dimensions. This allows the model to preserve semantically important regions while coarsely quantizing less critical areas.

Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame.

This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions.

To achieve robust temporal generalization, we introduce a novel Conservative Flux Quantization (CFQ) strategy, which redefines neural spikes as discrete packets of physical flux. Our CFQ learns a time-invariant physical evolution operator, enabling the PISNN to become a general-purpose solver -- conservative-by-construction.

We identify this open-loop bottleneck as a fundamental architectural limitation underlying well-documented failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning. To address this limitation, we introduce the closed-loop prediction principle, which requires that models iteratively refine latent representations until reaching a self-consistent equilibrium before committing to each token. We instantiate this principle as Equilibrium Transformers (EqT), which augment standard transformer layers with an Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes a learned energy function via gradient descent in latent space. The energy function enforces bidirectional prediction consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence, all computed without external supervision. Theoretically, we prove that EqT performs approximate MAP inference in a latent energy-based model, establish linear convergence guarantees, and show that refinement improves predictions precisely on hard instances where one-shot inference is suboptimal. The framework unifies deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training as special cases. Preliminary experiments on the binary parity task demonstrate +3.28% average improvement on challenging sequences, with gains reaching +8.07% where standard transformers approach random performance, validating that the benefit of deliberation scales with task difficulty.

Facial video data were processed using OpenCV for frame extraction and transferred learning with a pre-trained transformer model to derive emotional features. Concurrently, GSR signals were decomposed into tonic and phasic components to capture physiological arousal patterns. Two temporal windows were defined for trust prediction: the Early Detection Window (6 to 3 seconds before decision-making) and the Proximal Detection Window (3 to 0 seconds before decision-making). For each window, trust prediction was conducted separately using image-based, GSR-based, and multimodal (image + GSR) features. Each modality was analyzed using machine learning algorithms, and the top-performing unimodal models were integrated through a multimodal stacking ensemble for final prediction. Experimental results showed that combining facial and physiological cues significantly improved prediction performance.

Despite the advancements in deep learning, feature transformation remains essential for structured data, where deep models often struggle to capture complex feature interactions. Prior literature on automated feature transformation has achieved success but often relies on heuristics or exhaustive searches, leading to inefficient and time-consuming processes. Recent works employ reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance traditional approaches through a more effective trial-and-error way. However, two limitations remain: 1) Dynamic feature expansion during the transformation process, which causes instability and increases the learning complexity for RL agents; 2) Insufficient cooperation and communication between agents, which results in suboptimal feature crossing operations and degraded model performance. To address them, we propose a novel heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework to enable cooperative and scalable feature transformation. The framework comprises three heterogeneous agents, grouped into two types, each designed to select essential features and operations for feature crossing. To enhance communication among these agents, we implement a shared critic mechanism that facilitates information exchange during feature transformation. To handle the dynamically expanding feature space, we tailor multi-head attention-based feature agents to select suitable features for feature crossing. Additionally, we introduce a state encoding technique during the optimization process to stabilize and enhance the learning dynamics of the RL agents, resulting in more robust and reliable transformation policies.

Motivated by how populations of AI agents can sustain supracompetitive prices, we investigate whether high prices persist under such defections. Our main finding is that even a single human defection can destabilize collusion and drive down prices, and multiple defections push prices even closer to competitive levels.

Among all models, the multi-class Siamese network achieved the best overall performance with an average accuracy of 96.89%, demonstrating the potential of data-driven deep architectures for reliable, single-trial C-VEP decoding in adaptive non-invasive BCI systems."}

Richard Kuhn", "title": "ABLE: Using Adversarial Pairs to Construct Local Models for Explaining Model Predictions", "abstract": "Machine learning models are increasingly used in critical applications but are mostly \"black boxes\" due to their lack of transparency. Local explanation approaches, such as LIME, address this issue by approximating the behavior of complex models near a test instance using simple, interpretable models. However, these approaches often suffer from instability and poor local fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adversarially Bracketed Local Explanation (ABLE) to address these limitations. Our approach first generates a set of neighborhood points near the test instance, x_test, by adding bounded Gaussian noise. For each neighborhood point D, we apply an adversarial attack to generate an adversarial point A with minimal perturbation that results in a different label than D. A second adversarial attack is then performed on A to generate a point A' that has the same label as D (and thus different than A). The points A and A' form an adversarial pair that brackets the local decision boundary for x_test. We then train a linear model on these adversarial pairs to approximate the local decision boundary. Experimental results on six UCI benchmark datasets across three deep neural network architectures demonstrate that our approach achieves higher stability and fidelity than the state-of-the-art."}

In this project, we explore how to model CTR more effectively using a large-scale Taobao dataset released by Alibaba. We start with supervised learning models, including logistic regression and Light-GBM, that are trained on static features such as user demographics, ad attributes, and contextual metadata. These models provide fast, interpretable benchmarks, but have limited capabilities to capture patterns of behavior that drive clicks. To better model user intent, we combined behavioral data from hundreds of millions of interactions over a 22-day period. By extracting and encoding user action sequences, we construct representations of user interests over time. We use deep learning models to fuse behavioral embeddings with static features. Among them, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have achieved significant performance improvements. To capture temporal dynamics, we designed a Transformer-based architecture that uses a self-attention mechanism to learn contextual dependencies across behavioral sequences, modeling not only what the user interacts with, but also the timing and frequency of interactions. Transformer improves AUC by 2.81 % over the baseline (LR model), with the largest gains observed for users whose interests are diverse or change over time. In addition to modeling, we propose an A/B testing strategy for real-world evaluation. We also think about the broader implications: personalized ad targeting technology can be applied to public health scenarios to achieve precise delivery of health information or behavior guidance.

Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows.

To address these issues, we propose a novel driver drowsiness detection framework that leverages online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods to dynamically adjust to target subject distributions. Our proposed method updates the learnable parameters in batch normalization (BN) layers, while preserving pretrained normalization statistics, resulting in a modified configuration that ensures effective adaptation during test time. We incorporate a memory bank that dynamically manages streaming EEG segments, selecting samples based on their reliability determined by negative energy scores and persistence time.

Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of the optimization behavior of score matching, particularly in over-parameterized regimes, remains limited. In this work, we study gradient descent for training over-parameterized models to learn a single Gaussian distribution. Specifically, we use a student model with $n$ learnable parameters and train it on data generated from a single ground-truth Gaussian using the population score matching objective. We analyze the optimization dynamics under multiple regimes. When the noise scale is sufficiently large, we prove a global convergence result for gradient descent. In the low-noise regime, we identify the existence of a stationary point, highlighting the difficulty of proving global convergence in this case. Nevertheless, we show convergence under certain initialization conditions: when the parameters are initialized to be exponentially small, gradient descent ensures convergence of all parameters to the ground truth. We further prove that without the exponentially small initialization, the parameters may not converge to the ground truth. Finally, we consider the case where parameters are randomly initialized from a Gaussian distribution far from the ground truth. We prove that, with high probability, only one parameter converges while the others diverge, yet the loss still converges to zero with a $1/\\tau$ rate, where $\\tau$ is the number of iterations.

Anomaly detection in this context has the objective of identifying unusual temporal connections within the graph structure. Detecting edge anomalies in real time is crucial for mitigating potential risks. Unlike traditional anomaly detection, this task is particularly challenging due to concept drifts, large data volumes, and the need for real-time response. To face these challenges, we introduce ARES, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for edge streams. ARES combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for feature extraction with Half-Space Trees (HST) for anomaly scoring. GNNs capture both spike and burst anomalous behaviors within streams by embedding node and edge properties in a latent space, while HST partitions this space to isolate anomalies efficiently. ARES operates in an unsupervised way without the need for prior data labeling. To further validate its detection capabilities, we additionally incorporate a simple yet effective supervised thresholding mechanism. This approach leverages statistical dispersion among anomaly scores to determine the optimal threshold using a minimal set of labeled data, ensuring adaptability across different domains.

Existing approaches have shown promising results but face the issue of low sample efficiency from the manufacturing systems. It arises from the limitation of the classical Monte Carlo method when uncovering the mean response from a distribution. In contrast, recent work has shown that quantum algorithms can achieve the same level of estimation accuracy with significantly fewer samples than the classical Monte Carlo method from distributions. Therefore, we can adopt the estimation of the quantum algorithm to obtain the estimation from real physical systems (distributions). Motivated by this advantage, we propose a Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) framework for precise shape control during assembly to improve the sample efficiency in manufacturing practice. Specifically, this approach utilizes a quantum oracle, based on finite element analysis (FEA)-based models or surrogate models, to acquire a more accurate estimation of the environment response with fewer queries for a certain input. QBO employs an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) as the acquisition function to strategically select input values that are most likely to maximize the objective function. It has been theoretically proven to require much fewer samples while maintaining comparable optimization results. In the case study, force-controlled actuators are applied to one fuselage section to adjust its shape and reduce the gap to the adjoining section.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of how low-rank factorization affects LLM trustworthiness across privacy, adversarial robustness, fairness, and ethical alignment. We evaluate multiple LLMs of different sizes and variants compressed with diverse low-rank algorithms, revealing key insights: (1) low-rank compression preserves or improves training data privacy but weakens PII protection during conversation; (2) adversarial robustness is generally preserved and often enhanced, even under deep compression; (3) ethical reasoning degrades in zero-shot settings but partially recovers with few-shot prompting; (4) fairness declines under compression.

The approach integrates Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to enable end-to-end uncertainty-aware inference and prediction. In the diagnosis phase, model-form errors (MFEs) are treated as latent input forces to a nominal linear dynamical system and jointly estimated with system states using GPLFM from sensor measurements. A BNN is then trained on posterior samples to learn a probabilistic nonlinear mapping from system states to MFEs, while capturing diagnostic uncertainty. For prognosis, this mapping is used to generate pseudo-measurements, enabling state prediction via Kalman filtering. The framework allows for systematic propagation of uncertainty from diagnosis to prediction, a key capability for trustworthy digital twins. The framework is demonstrated using four nonlinear examples: a single degree of freedom (DOF) oscillator, a multi-DOF system, and two established benchmarks -- the Bouc-Wen hysteretic system and the Silverbox experimental dataset -- highlighting its predictive accuracy and robustness to model misspecification."}

To address this problem, we propose Federated Representation Entanglement (FedRE), a framework built upon a novel form of client knowledge termed entangled representation. In FedRE, each client aggregates its local representations into a single entangled representation using normalized random weights and applies the same weights to integrate the corresponding one-hot label encodings into the entangled-label encoding. Those are then uploaded to the server to train a global classifier. During training, each entangled representation is supervised across categories via its entangled-label encoding, while random weights are resampled each round to introduce diversity, mitigating the global classifier's overconfidence and promoting smoother decision boundaries. Furthermore, each client uploads a single cross-category entangled representation along with its entangled-label encoding, mitigating the risk of representation inversion attacks and reducing communication overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedRE achieves an effective trade-off among model performance, privacy protection, and communication overhead. The codes are available atthis https URL."}

In this work we initiate a systematic study into inexact OMD, and uncover an intricate relation between regularizer smoothness and robustness to approximation errors. When the regularizer is uniformly smooth, we establish a tight bound on the excess regret due to errors. Then, for barrier regularizers over the simplex and its subsets, we identify a sharp separation: negative entropy requires exponentially small errors to avoid linear regret, whereas log-barrier and Tsallis regularizers remain robust even when the errors are only polynomial. Finally, we show that when the losses are stochastic and the domain is the simplex, negative entropy regains robustness-but this property does not extend to all subsets, where exponentially small errors are again necessary to avoid suboptimal regret."}

While regularisation and replay perform well in vision, they lag behind multi-task learning for large language models (LLMs), especially at scale with many tasks. We revisit replay and argue that two failure modes drive this gap: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge). To address selection, we propose Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe), a simple, architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores the most surprising (high Negative Log-Likelihood) sequences. SuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting and delivers the best overall average across both Standard CL and LNT benchmarks. To address integration, we add a dual-learner design with fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via an exponential moving average (EMA), enabling rapid adaptation while stabilising long-term knowledge. Combining SuRe with the dual learner yields further gains, including improvements of up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our proposed method remains robust under reduced replay frequency and small buffer size, demonstrating both effectiveness and sample efficiency. Taken together, our results establish replay as a strong baseline for continual LLM fine-tuning and demonstrate that surprise-based selection and slow-weight consolidation are complementary components for mitigating catastrophic forgetting."}

This paper introduces TS2Vec-Ensemble, a novel hybrid framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach enhances the powerful, implicitly learned dynamics from a pretrained TS2Vec encoder by fusing them with explicit, engineered time features that encode periodic cycles. This fusion is achieved through a dual-model ensemble architecture, where two distinct regression heads -- one focused on learned dynamics and the other on seasonal patterns -- are combined using an adaptive weighting scheme. The ensemble weights are optimized independently for each forecast horizon, allowing the model to dynamically prioritize short-term dynamics or long-term seasonality as needed. We conduct extensive experiments on the ETT benchmark datasets for both univariate and multivariate forecasting.

(2025) addressed this with SuGAr, which learns and aggregates diverse invariant subgraphs via a sampler and diversity regularizer, improving robustness but still relying on simple uniform or greedy aggregation. To overcome this, the proposed PISA framework introduces a dynamic MLP-based aggregation that prioritizes and combines subgraph representations more effectively. Experiments on 15 datasets, including DrugOOD (Ji et al., 2023), show that PISA achieves up to 5% higher classification accuracy than prior methods."}

The Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) methods modeled by the dual-tower network are widely used in the industry to maintain both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, the dual-tower model has significant limitations: the embeddings of users and ads interact only at the final inner product computation, resulting in insufficient feature interaction capabilities. Although DNN-based models with both user and ad as input features, allowing for early-stage interaction between these features, are introduced in the ranking stage to mitigate this issue, they are computationally infeasible for the retrieval stage. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an efficient GPU-based feature interaction for the dual-tower network to significantly improve retrieval accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs. Specifically, we introduce a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient feature interaction computation at scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework in the industry to successfully implement Wide and Deep in a retrieval system. We apply this model to the real-world business scenarios in Tencent Advertising, and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and has been successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system, delivering significant online performance gains. This improvement not only validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, but also provides new practical guidance for optimizing large-scale ad retrieval systems."}

However, existing quantization frameworks typically focus on perplexity or classification accuracy, often omitting critical trustworthiness metrics. This gap introduces risks when applying quantized LLMs to downstream high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of quantization on four trustworthiness metrics (adversarial robustness, fairness, machine ethics, and out-of-distribution robustness) and identify the instability across compression ratios and quantization methods. Building on these observations, we develop a novel precision-ensemble voting approach that leverages predictions from mixed-precision variants of the same model and consistently improves performance by up to $5.8\\%$ on trustworthiness metrics. Our results highlight the importance of considering trustworthiness when developing model compression techniques and point to research opportunities at the intersection of compression and trustworthiness for safety-critical applications."}

We conduct a comprehensive, cross-model evaluation of two DP mechanisms, differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) and local differential privacy (LDP), applied to four recommender systems (Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Variational Autoencoder (VAE)) on the MovieLens-1M and Yelp datasets. We find that stronger privacy consistently reduces utility, but not uniformly. NCF under DPSGD shows the smallest accuracy loss (under 10 percent at epsilon approximately 1), whereas SVD and BPR experience larger drops, especially for users with niche preferences. VAE is the most sensitive to privacy, with sharp declines for sparsely represented groups. The impact on bias metrics is similarly heterogeneous.

The approach is based on a reference trajectory, for which the Koopman mode amplitudes are first identified, and the Koopman mode decomposition is transformed to a new basis, which contains fundamental functions of eigenvalues and time. The initial values of the eigenfunctions are obtained by projecting trajectories onto this basis via a regularized least-squares fit. A global optimizer was employed to optimize the eigenvalues. Mapping initial-state values to eigenfunction values reveals their spatial structure, enabling the numerical computation of their gradients. Thus, deviations from the Koopman partial differential equation are penalized, leading to more robust solutions. The approach was successfully tested on several benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, including the FitzHugh-Nagumo system with inputs, van der Pol and Duffing oscillators, and a 2-spool turbojet engine with control. The study demonstrates that incorporating principal eigenvalues and spatial structure integrity promotion significantly improves the accuracy of Koopman predictors. The approach effectively discovers Koopman spectral components even with sparse state-space sampling and reveals geometric features of the state space, such as invariant partitions. Finally, the numerical approximation of the eigenfunction gradient can be used for input dynamics modeling and control design.

In this paper, we propose a novel MUFS method, termed Structure-aware Hybrid-order sImilarity learNing for multi-viEw unsupervised Feature Selection (SHINE-FS), to address the aforementioned problem. SHINE-FS first learns consensus anchors and the corresponding anchor graph to capture the cross-view relationships between the anchors and the samples. Based on the acquired cross-view consensus information, it generates low-dimensional representations of the samples, which facilitate the reconstruction of multi-view data by identifying discriminative features. Subsequently, it employs the anchor-sample relationships to learn a second-order similarity graph. Furthermore, by jointly learning first-order and second-order similarity graphs, SHINE-FS constructs a hybrid-order similarity graph that captures both local and global structures, thereby revealing the intrinsic data structure to enhance feature selection.

Evaluated on multiple RF datasets, GSpaRC achieves similar CSI reconstruction fidelity to recent state-of-the-art methods while reducing training and inference time by over an order of magnitude. By trading modest GPU computation for a substantial reduction in pilot overhead, GSpaRC enables scalable, low-latency channel estimation suitable for deployment in 5G and future wireless systems.

Symbolic regression (SR) using genetic programming (GP) can generate flexible models but is prone to unreliable behaviour in extrapolation. This paper investigates whether adding synthetic data can help improve performance in such cases. We apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify regions in the input space where the training data is sparse. Synthetic data is then generated in those regions using a knowledge distillation approach: a teacher model generates predictions on new input points, which are then used to train a student model. We evaluate this method across six benchmark datasets, using neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and GP both as teacher models (to generate synthetic data) and as student models (trained on the augmented data). Results show that GP models can often improve when trained on synthetic data, especially in extrapolation areas. However, the improvement depends on the dataset and teacher model used. The most important improvements are observed when synthetic data from GPe is used to train GPp in extrapolation regions. Changes in interpolation areas show only slight changes. We also observe heterogeneous errors, where model performance varies across different regions of the input space. Overall, this approach offers a practical solution for better extrapolation.

A detailed analysis of computation patterns, memory access, I/O characteristics, and scaling properties was performed for sequence lengths ranging from 64 to 16384 tokens.

Beyond popular deterministic methods, generative models are gaining attention due to advancements in areas like image synthesis and video generation, as well as their inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions. However, existing generative approaches mostly involve recurrent generative operations or repeated denoising steps, making the prediction laborious, particularly for long-term forecasting. Most of them only conduct experiments for relatively short-term forecasting, with limited comparison to deterministic methods in long-term forecasting, leaving their practical advantages unclear. This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting."}

Forkert", "title": "CRAwDAD: Causal Reasoning Augmentation with Dual-Agent Debate", "abstract": "When people reason about cause and effect, they often consider many competing \"what if\" scenarios before deciding which explanation fits best. Analogously, advanced language models capable of causal inference can consider multiple interventions and counterfactuals to judge the validity of causal claims. Crucially, this type of reasoning is less like a single calculation and more like an internal dialogue between alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we make this dialogue explicit through a dual-agent debate framework where one model provides a structured causal inference, and the other critically examines this reasoning for logical flaws. When disagreements arise, agents attempt to persuade each other, challenging each other's logic and revising their conclusions until they converge on a mutually agreed answer. To take advantage of this deliberative process, we specifically use reasoning language models, whose strengths in both causal inference and adversarial debate remain under-explored relative to standard large language models. We evaluate our approach on the CLadder dataset, a benchmark linking natural language questions to formally defined causal graphs across all three rungs of Pearl's ladder of causation. With Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 as debater agents, we demonstrate that multi-agent debate improves DeepSeek-R1's overall accuracy in causal inference from 78.03% to 87.45%, with the counterfactual category specifically improving from 67.94% to 80.04% accuracy. Similarly, Qwen3's overall accuracy improves from 84.16% to 89.41%, and counterfactual questions from 71.53% to 80.35%, showing that strong models can still benefit greatly from debate with weaker agents.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment.

This study introduces a data-driven framework for modeling chaotic pedestrian movement using empirically observed trajectory data and supervised learning. Videos were recorded during both daytime and nighttime conditions to capture pedestrian dynamics under varying ambient and traffic contexts. Pedestrian trajectories were extracted through computer vision techniques, and behavioral chaos was quantified using four chaos metrics: Approximate Entropy and Lyapunov Exponent, each computed for both velocity and direction change. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then applied to consolidate these indicators into a unified chaos score. A comprehensive set of individual, group-level, and contextual traffic features was engineered and used to train Random Forest and CatBoost regression models. CatBoost models consistently achieved superior performance. The best daytime PCA-based CatBoost model reached an R^2 of 0.8319, while the nighttime PCA-based CatBoost model attained an R^2 of 0.8574. SHAP analysis highlighted that features such as distance travel, movement duration, and speed variability were robust contributors to chaotic behavior. The proposed framework enables practitioners to quantify and anticipate behavioral instability in real-world settings. Planners and engineers can use chaos scores to identify high-risk pedestrian zones, apprise infrastructure improvements, and calibrate realistic microsimulation models. The approach also supports adaptive risk assessment in automated vehicle systems by capturing short-term motion unpredictability grounded in observable, interpretable features."}

Large-scale foundation models, though powerful, are not typically pretrained on ECG data, making full re-training or fine-tuning computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose EnECG(Mixture of Experts-based Ensemble Learning for ECG Multi-tasks), an ensemble-based framework that integrates multiple specialized foundation models, each excelling in different aspects of ECG interpretation. Instead of relying on a single model or single task, EnECG leverages the strengths of multiple specialized models to tackle a variety of ECG-based tasks.

While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling.

We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional, constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization task, and introduce a sequential two-level fidelity strategy to minimize expensive destructive die-strength evaluations. On bare silicon and product wafers, our method autonomously delivers feasible configurations that match or exceed expert baselines in production speed, die strength, and structural integrity, using only technician-level operation. Post-hoc validation of different weight configurations of the utility functions reveals that multiple feasible solutions with qualitatively different trade-offs can be obtained from the final surrogate model.

We theoretically demonstrate that, after training with gradient descent, a one-layer transformer model can achieve optimal accuracy in predicting random walks. Importantly, our analysis reveals that the trained model is interpretable: the trained softmax attention serves as a token selector, focusing on the direct parent state; subsequently, the value matrix executes a one-step probability transition to predict the location of the next state based on this parent state. We also show that certain edge cases not covered by our theory are indeed failure cases, demonstrating that our theoretical conditions are tight. By investigating these success and failure cases, it is revealed that gradient descent with small initialization may fail or struggle to converge to a good solution in certain simple tasks even beyond random walks.

Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost. These results highlight the potential of combining Bayesian approximations with code generation to enable efficient BNN deployment on resource-constrained systems."}

However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL."}

Inverse heat problems have wide-ranging uses, but a critical application lies in quantifying how building facade renovation reduces thermal transmittance, a key determinant of building energy efficiency. However, solving inverse heat problems with non-invasive data collected in situ is error-prone due to environmental variability or deviations from theoretically assumed conditions. Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851. Our work demonstrates the potential of PINN-based methods for reliable estimation of material properties in situ and under realistic conditions, without lengthy measurement campaigns. Given the lack of research on using machine learning, and more specifically on PINNs, for solving in-situ inverse problems, we expect our work to be a starting point for more research on the topic."}

In this work, we investigate the impact of \\emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model, evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection.

We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average.

To make the comparison concrete and domain-agnostic, we design a controlled suite of experiments in which models embed short numerical sequences and are evaluated on their ability to cluster and classify those sequences according to well-defined number-theoretic properties. Our experimental protocol compares four families of models: (1) non-LLM encoders trained from scratch or fine-tuned for embeddings, (2) LLM-based encoders adapted with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA), (3) LLM-based encoders with LoRA followed by model souping merging into the base weights, and (4) the same LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP across checkpoints or stages. We evaluate representational quality with clustering indices (Silhouette and Davies Bouldin). We additionally analyze the use of kmeans labels to see if the embeddings encode any other information besides the one we are testing for. Empirically, we find that LLM-based backbones produce embeddings that better capture higher-order, compositional numeric patterns, but are prone to adapter dominance that degrades balanced generalization; SLERP merging consistently recovers base-model structure while retaining most task gains, yielding superior tradeoffs in clustering separability, and robustness compared to model souping or models that were not merged."}

LLMs inherit explicit and implicit biases from the datasets they were trained on; these biases can include social, ethical, cultural, religious, and other prejudices and stereotypes. It is important to comprehensively examine such shortcomings by identifying the existence and extent of such biases, recognizing the origin, and attempting to mitigate such biased outputs to ensure fair outputs to reduce harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study inspects and highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We utilize bias-specific benchmarks such StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in many different generative models such as BERT, GPT 3.5, and ADA. To detect both explicit and implicit biases, we adopt a three-pronged approach for thorough and inclusive analysis. Results indicate fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excel at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings also illustrated that despite some cases of success, LLMs often over-rely on keywords in prompts and its outputs. This demonstrates the incapability of LLMs to attempt to truly understand the accuracy and authenticity of its outputs. Finally, in an attempt to bolster model performance, we applied an enhancement learning strategy involving fine-tuning, models using different prompting techniques, and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. We found fine-tuned models to exhibit promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%."}

It can be interpreted as a bound on adversary's capability to distinguish two adjacent datasets according to chosen adjacency relation. In practice, most DP implementations use the add/remove adjacency relation, where two datasets are adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by adding or removing a single record, thereby protecting membership. In many ML applications, however, the goal is to protect attributes of individual records (e.g., labels used in supervised fine-tuning). We show that privacy accounting under add/remove overstates attribute privacy compared to accounting under the substitute adjacency relation, which permits substituting one record. To demonstrate this gap, we develop novel attacks to audit DP under substitute adjacency, and show empirically that audit results are inconsistent with DP guarantees reported under add/remove, yet remain consistent with the budget accounted under the substitute adjacency relation. Our results highlight that the choice of adjacency when reporting DP guarantees is critical when the protection target is per-record attributes rather than membership."}

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to support such evaluation tasks, from academic peer review to automated scientific assessment. However, despite the growing use of LLMs in review systems, their capabilities to pinpoint errors remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fault Localization Across Writing in Science (FLAWS), an automated benchmark consisting of 713 paper-error pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs detect errors that undermine key claims in research papers. We construct the benchmark by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs, paired with an automated evaluation metric that measures whether models can identify and localize these errors. Developing such a benchmark presents unique challenges that we overcome: ensuring that the inserted errors are well-defined, challenging, and relevant to the content of the paper, avoiding artifacts that would make identification trivial, and designing a scalable, automated evaluation metric. On the resulting benchmark, we evaluate five frontier LLMs: Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek Reasoner v3.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 5, and Grok 4. Among these, GPT 5 is the top-performing model, achieving 39.1% identification accuracy when k=10, where k is the number of top-ranked error text candidates generated by the LLM."}

While neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, they often fail to preserve critical physical properties such as stability and typically assume stationary dynamics, limiting their applicability under distribution shifts. Existing approaches generally address either stability or adaptability in isolation, lacking a unified framework that ensures both. We propose LILAD (Learning In-Context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics), a novel framework for system identification that jointly guarantees adaptability and stability. LILAD simultaneously learns a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function through in-context learning (ICL), explicitly accounting for parametric uncertainty. Trained across a diverse set of tasks, LILAD produces a stability-aware, adaptive dynamics model alongside an adaptive Lyapunov certificate. At test time, both components adapt to a new system instance using a short trajectory prompt, which enables fast generalization. To rigorously ensure stability, LILAD also computes a state-dependent attenuator that enforces a sufficient decrease condition on the Lyapunov function for any state in the new system instance. This mechanism extends stability guarantees even under out-of-distribution and out-of-task scenarios. We evaluate LILAD on benchmark autonomous systems and demonstrate that it outperforms adaptive, robust, and non-adaptive baselines in predictive accuracy."}

The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score.

While Spain integrated into dense European institutional architectures, Uruguay remained embedded within the Latin American governance regime, characterized by weaker coordination and lower institutional coherence. To assess how alternative institutional embeddings could have altered these paths, the study develops a generative counterfactual framework grounded in economic complexity, institutional path dependence, and a Wasserstein GAN trained on data from 1960-2020. The resulting Expected Developmental Shift (EDS) quantifies structural gains or losses from hypothetical re-embedding in different institutional ecosystems. Counterfactual simulations indicate that Spain would have experienced significant developmental decline under a Latin American configuration, while Uruguay would have achieved higher complexity and resilience within a European regime. These findings suggest that development is not solely determined by domestic reforms but emerges from a country's structural position within transnational institutional networks."}

Data augmentation has proven to be an effective strategy to address this limitation by increasing dataset diversity and improving model generalization without requiring additional field data. However, most augmentation techniques used to date rely on effective but relatively simple transformations, leaving open the question of whether deep generative models can provide additional benefits. In this study, we evaluate the potential of deep generative for data augmentation in marine mammal call detection including: Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. Using Southern Resident Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) vocalizations from two long-term hydrophone deployments in the Salish Sea, we compare these approaches against traditional augmentation methods such as time-shifting and vocalization masking. While all generative approaches improved classification performance relative to the baseline, diffusion-based augmentation yielded the highest recall (0.87) and overall F1-score (0.75). A hybrid strategy combining generative-based synthesis with traditional methods achieved the best overall performance with an F1-score of 0.81. We hope this study encourages further exploration of deep generative models as complementary augmentation strategies to advance acoustic monitoring of threatened marine mammal populations."}

However, despite its popularity, DP imposes strict requirements which guard against strong worst-case scenarios. For example, it guards against seemingly unrealistic scenarios where an attacker has full information about all but one point in the data set, and still nothing can be learned about the remaining point. While preventing such a strong attack is desirable, many works have explored whether average-case relaxations of DP are easier to satisfy [HWR13,WLF16,BF16,LWX23].In this work, we are motivated by the question of whether alternate, weaker notions of privacy are possible: can a weakened privacy notion still guarantee some basic level of privacy, and on the other hand, achieve privacy more efficiently and/or for a substantially broader set of tasks? Our main result shows the answer is no: even in the statistical setting, any reasonable measure of privacy satisfying nontrivial composition is equivalent to DP. To prove this, we identify a core set of four axioms or desiderata: pre-processing invariance, prohibition of blatant non-privacy, strong composition, and linear scalability. Our main theorem shows that any privacy measure satisfying our axioms is equivalent to DP, up to polynomial factors in sample complexity. We complement this result by showing our axioms are minimal: removing any one of our axioms enables ill-behaved measures of privacy."}

We solve the resulting non-convex minimax problem via an alternating best response algorithm with two subproblems: the alpha subproblem is a standard kernel SVM dual solved via LIBSVM, while the beta subproblem admits an efficient solution via the Greedy Selector and Simplex Projector algorithm. We reformulate SMKL as a mixed integer semidefinite optimization problem and derive a hierarchy of semidefinite convex relaxations which can be used to certify near-optimality of the solutions returned by our best response algorithm and also to warm start it. On ten UCI benchmarks, our method with random initialization outperforms state-of-the-art MKL approaches in out-of-sample prediction accuracy on average by 3.34 percentage points (relative to the best performing benchmark) while selecting a small number of candidate kernels in comparable runtime.

Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment.

We first developed a global dataset consisting of 12K RGB-DEM pairs using Landsat satellite imagery and NASA's SRTM digital elevation data, both from the year 2000. A unique preprocessing pipeline was implemented to select high-quality, cloud-free regions and aggregate normalized RGB composites from Landsat imagery.

The results demonstrate promising performance in mountainous regions, achieving an overall mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.4671 and a mean SSIM score of 0.2065 (scale -1 to 1), while highlighting limitations in lowland and residential areas.

Mean-variance regression models, which predict both a mean and residual noise for each data point, provide a simple approach to uncertainty quantification. However, overparameterized mean-variance models struggle with signal-to-noise ambiguity, deciding whether prediction targets should be attributed to signal (mean) or noise (variance). At one extreme, models fit all training targets perfectly with zero residual noise, while at the other, they provide constant, uninformative predictions and explain the targets as noise. We observe a sharp phase transition between these extremes, driven by model regularization. Empirical studies with varying regularization levels illustrate this transition, revealing substantial variability across repeated runs. To explain this behavior, we develop a statistical field theory framework, which captures the observed phase transition in alignment with experimental results. This analysis reduces the regularization hyperparameter search space from two dimensions to one, significantly lowering computational costs.

Theoretical analyses demonstrate that RHPSVM conforms to Bayesian rules, has a strict generalization error bound, a bounded influence function, and controllable optimality conditions, ensuring excellent classification accuracy, outlier insensitivity, and resampling stability. Additionally, RHPSVM can be extended to various advanced SVM variants by adjusting parameters, enhancing its flexibility. We transform the non-convex optimization problem of RHPSVM into a series of convex subproblems using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) and solve it with the ClipDCD algorithm, which is proven to be convergent.

VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map.

To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum.

Our two-level classifier, which integrates CoSENT (BERT-based), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and traditional classification algorithms, achieves a 97.88% precision. The research process amasses the NRD2024 dataset, which contains continuous detection information over 20 days for 1,500,000 newly registered domain names across 6 directions. Results from our case study demonstrate that this method also maintains a forecast precision of over 70% for PGDN that are delayed in usage after registration."}

Such inconsistencies are particularly problematic for editing of 3D representations such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models. We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

However, the training datasets may be crowdsourced and include sensitive information, such as personal contact details, financial data, and medical records. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on developing privacy-preserving training algorithms for neural networks that maintain good performance while preserving privacy. In this paper, we investigate the generalization and privacy performances of the differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD) algorithm, which is a private variant of the gradient descent (GD) by incorporating additional noise into the gradients during each iteration. Moreover, we identify a concrete learning task where DP-GD can achieve superior generalization performance compared to GD in training two-layer Huberized ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, a small signal-to-noise ratio can result in GD producing training models with poor test accuracy, whereas DP-GD can yield training models with good test accuracy and privacy guarantees if the signal-to-noise ratio is not too small. This indicates that DP-GD has the potential to enhance model performance while ensuring privacy protection in certain learning tasks. Numerical simulations are further conducted to support our theoretical results."}

Jeff Hong", "title": "UCB for Large-Scale Pure Exploration: Beyond Sub-Gaussianity", "abstract": "Selecting the best alternative from a finite set represents a broad class of pure exploration problems. Traditional approaches to pure exploration have predominantly relied on Gaussian or sub-Gaussian assumptions on the performance distributions of all alternatives, which limit their applicability to non-sub-Gaussian especially heavy-tailed problems. The need to move beyond sub-Gaussianity may become even more critical in large-scale problems, which tend to be especially sensitive to distributional specifications. In this paper, motivated by the widespread use of upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms in pure exploration and beyond, we investigate their performance in the large-scale, non-sub-Gaussian settings. We consider the simplest category of UCB algorithms, where the UCB value for each alternative is defined as the sample mean plus an exploration bonus that depends only on its own sample size. We abstract this into a meta-UCB algorithm and propose letting it select the alternative with the largest sample size as the best upon stopping. For this meta-UCB algorithm, we first derive a distribution-free lower bound on the probability of correct selection. Building on this bound, we analyze two general non-sub-Gaussian scenarios: (1) all alternatives follow a common location-scale structure and have bounded variance; and (2) when such a structure does not hold, each alternative has a bounded absolute moment of order $q > 3$. In both settings, we show that the meta-UCB algorithm and therefore a broad class of UCB algorithms can achieve the sample optimality. These results demonstrate the applicability of UCB algorithms for solving large-scale pure exploration problems with non-sub-Gaussian distributions. Numerical experiments support our results and provide additional insights into the comparative behaviors of UCB algorithms within and beyond our meta-UCB framework."}

This is because the probability mass of the marginal posterior distribution of the parameter representing the period is usually highly concentrated in a very small region of the parameter space. Therefore, it is necessary to provide as much information as possible to the inference method through the parameter prior distribution. We intend to show that it is possible to construct a prior distribution from the data by fitting a Gaussian process (GP) with a periodic kernel. More specifically, we want to show that it is possible to approximate the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter corresponding to the period in the kernel. Subsequently, this distribution can be used as a prior distribution for the inference method. We use an adaptive importance sampling method to approximate the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters of the GP. Then, we use the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter related to the periodicity in order to construct a prior distribution for the period of the parametric model. This workflow is empirical Bayes, implemented as a modular (cut) transfer of a GP posterior for the period to the parametric model. We applied the proposed methodology to both synthetic and real data. We approximated the posterior distribution of the period of the GP kernel and then passed it forward as a posterior-as-prior with no feedback.

Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%).

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks."}

While this makes individual AI models clearer, the overarching system architecture remains opaque. This challenge not only pertains to standard XAI techniques but also to human examination and conversational XAI approaches that need access to model internals to interpret them correctly and completely. To this end, we propose conceptually representing such interactive systems as sequences of structural building blocks.

It follows a procedure with four steps that adaptively selects strategies based on image difficulty and is equipped with specialized tools such as visual reverse search, which emulates how humans gather external geographic clues. Experimental results show that GEO-Detective outperforms baseline large vision language models (LVLMs) overall, particularly on images lacking visible geographic features. In country level geolocation tasks, it achieves an improvement of over 11.1% compared to baseline LLMs, and even at finer grained levels, it still provides around a 5.2% performance gain.

In the case of classification, precision and recall are scores with probabilistic interpretations that are both important to consider and complementary. The rankings induced by these two scores are often in partial contradiction. In practice, therefore, it is extremely useful to establish a compromise between the two views to obtain a single, global ranking. Over the last fifty years or so,it has been proposed to take a weighted harmonic mean, known as the F-score, F-measure, or $F_\\beta$. Generally speaking, by averaging basic scores, we obtain a score that is intermediate in terms of values. However, there is no guarantee that these scores lead to meaningful rankings and no guarantee that the rankings are good tradeoffs between these base scores. Given the ubiquity of $F_\\beta$ scores in the literature, some clarification is in order. Concretely: (1) We establish that $F_\\beta$-induced rankings are meaningful and define a shortest path between precision- and recall-induced rankings. (2) We frame the problem of finding a tradeoff between two scores as an optimization problem expressed with Kendall rank correlations. We show that $F_1$ and its skew-insensitive version are far from being optimal in that regard.

We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models.

To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay. This work highlights latent drift as a practical and interpretable replay signal for advancing robust continual learning in real world medical settings."}

To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks.

While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D Córdoba-Córdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schrödinger equations.

Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps.

Recent work address this problem using a model-based approach: language is incorporated into a world model, which is then used to learn a behavior policy. However, these existing methods either do not demonstrate policy generalization to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions. For instance, assuming that the latency induced by inference-time planning is tolerable for the target task or expert demonstrations are available. Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3.

In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network.

To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions.

We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile.

Moreover, despite the availability of larger public benchmark malware datasets, malware clustering studies have avoided fully utilizing these datasets in their experiments, often resorting to small datasets with only a few families. Additionally, the current state-of-the-art solutions for malware clustering remain unclear. In our study, we evaluate malware clustering quality and establish the state-of-the-art on Bodmas and Ember - two large public benchmark malware datasets. Ours is the first study of malware clustering performed on whole malware benchmark datasets. Additionally, we extend the malware clustering task by incorporating benign samples. Our results indicate that incorporating benign samples does not significantly degrade clustering quality. We find that there are significant differences in the quality of the created clusters between Ember and Bodmas, as well as a private industry dataset. Contrary to popular opinion, our top clustering performers are K-Means and BIRCH, with DBSCAN and HAC falling behind."}

Second, we uncover a \"phase transition\" phenomenon governed by the subsampling rate $\\beta$ (where $s \\asymp n^{\\beta}$).

Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model.

This paper fundamentally challenges the conventional wisdom that outliers are data-driven. We demonstrate that extreme outliers are a data-independent, mechanically-produced artifact of training, originating from specific structural properties of the weight matrices (i.e., colinearity). Based on this insight, we propose TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers), a novel, non-invasive loss function. TWEO effectively prevents extreme outliers via a very simple loss term, which reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20. TWEO then enables full-model FP8 pre-training with neither engineering tricks nor architectural changes for both LLM and ViT. When standard FP8 training catastrophically collapses, TWEO achieves performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while delivering a 36% increase in training throughput. Also, TWEO enables a new quantization paradigm.

This OOD latent property allows us to synthesize new images of the target unseen domain by discovering qualified OOD latent encodings in the inverted noisy spaces, without altering the pre-trained models.

Additionally, these methods often assume QoS data reliability, neglecting potential credibility issues such as outliers and the presence of greysheep users and services with atypical invocation patterns. Furthermore, traditional approaches fail to leverage diverse features, including domain-specific knowledge and complex higher-order patterns, essential for accurate QoS predictions. In this paper, we introduce a real-time, trust-aware framework for temporal QoS prediction to address the aforementioned challenges, featuring an end-to-end deep architecture called the Hypergraph Convoluted Transformer Network (HCTN). HCTN combines a hypergraph structure with graph convolution over hyper-edges to effectively address high-sparsity issues by capturing complex, high-order correlations. Complementing this, the transformer network utilizes multi-head attention along with parallel 1D convolutional layers and fully connected dense blocks to capture both fine-grained and coarse-grained dynamic patterns.

This adaptive alignment preserves measurement consistency while substantially accelerating constrained inference. For noise-free linear inverse problems, CDIM exactly satisfies the measurement constraints with few projection steps, even when existing methods fail.

In this paper, we study TTA under mixed distribution shifts and move beyond conventional whole-batch adaptation paradigms. By revisiting distribution shifts from a spectral perspective, we find that the heterogeneity across latent domains is often pronounced in Fourier space. In particular, high-frequency components encode domain-specific variations, which facilitates clearer separation of samples from different distributions. Motivated by this observation, we propose to un-mix heterogeneous data streams using high-frequency domain cues, making diverse shift patterns more tractable. To this end, we propose Frequency-based Decentralized Adaptation (FreDA), a novel framework that decomposes globally heterogeneous data stream into locally homogeneous clusters in the Fourier space. It leverages decentralized learning and augmentation strategies to robustly adapt under mixed domain shifts.

In particular, vehicle sensing systems show great potential in the flexible acquisition of spatio-temporal urban data through built-in sensors under diverse sensing scenarios. However, vehicle systems often exhibit biased coverage due to the heterogeneous nature of trip requests and routes. To achieve a high sensing coverage, a critical challenge lies in optimally relocating vehicles to minimize the divergence between vehicle distributions and target sensing distributions. Conventional approaches typically employ a two-stage predict-then-optimize (PTO) process: first predicting real-time vehicle distributions and subsequently generating an optimal relocation strategy based on the predictions. However, this approach can lead to suboptimal decision-making due to the propagation of errors from upstream prediction. To this end, we develop an end-to-end Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) framework by integrating optimization into prediction within the deep learning architecture, and the entire framework is trained by minimizing the task-specific matching divergence rather than the upstream prediction error. Methodologically, we formulate the vehicle relocation problem by quadratic programming (QP) and incorporate a novel unrolling approach based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) within the SPO framework to compute gradients of the QP layer, facilitating backpropagation and gradient-based optimization for end-to-end learning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by real-world taxi datasets in Hong Kong.

Moving beyond such introspection and inspired by core methodologies in ethology, we propose an externalist three-step framework Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR). Rather than relying on a model's introspection, DRR evaluates its observable behaviors to provide corrective feedback. DRR first distills the reasoner's behavioral traces, then trains a lightweight, external Discriminative Model (DM). At inference time, this DM acts as a critic, identifying and rejecting suspicious reasoning steps. This external feedback compels the LLM to discard flawed pathways and explore alternatives, thereby enhancing reasoning quality without altering the base model.

Second, Final-State Imitation trains successive generations of agents to imitate reconstructions rather than messages, enforcing a tighter communication bottleneck. Third, Pairwise Distance Maximization regularizes message diversity by encouraging high distances between messages, with formal links to entropy maximization.

However, in practice, data availability often exhibits a hybrid nature, where both regimes coexist. This hybrid setting presents new opportunities for model training, as the two regimes offer complementary trade-offs: decentralized data is abundant but subject to heterogeneity and communication constraints, while centralized data, though limited in volume and potentially unrepresentative, enables better curation and high-throughput access. Despite its potential, effectively combining these paradigms remains challenging, and few frameworks are tailored to hybrid data regimes. To address this, we propose a novel framework that constructs a model atlas from decentralized models and leverages centralized data to refine a global model within this structured space. The refined model is then used to reinitialize the decentralized models. Our method synergizes federated learning (to exploit decentralized data) and model merging (to utilize centralized data), enabling effective training under hybrid data availability. Theoretically, we show that our approach achieves faster convergence than methods relying solely on decentralized data, due to variance reduction in the merging process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms purely centralized, purely decentralized, and existing hybrid-adaptable methods. Notably, our method remains robust even when the centralized and decentralized data domains differ or when decentralized data contains noise, significantly broadening its applicability."}

To tackle these challenges, we propose ShieldAgent, the first guardrail agent designed to enforce explicit safety policy compliance for the action trajectory of other protected agents through logical reasoning. Specifically, ShieldAgent first constructs a safety policy model by extracting verifiable rules from policy documents and structuring them into a set of action-based probabilistic rule circuits. Given the action trajectory of the protected agent, ShieldAgent retrieves relevant rule circuits and generates a shielding plan, leveraging its comprehensive tool library and executable code for formal verification. In addition, given the lack of guardrail benchmarks for agents, we introduce ShieldAgent-Bench, a dataset with 3K safety-related pairs of agent instructions and action trajectories, collected via SOTA attacks across 6 web environments and 7 risk categories. Experiments show that ShieldAgent achieves SOTA on ShieldAgent-Bench and three existing benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by 11.3% on average with a high recall of 90.1%.

By decoupling proximal mappings from local updates, FedCanon requires only a single proximal evaluation on the server per iteration, thereby reducing the overall proximal computation cost. Concurrently, it integrates control variables into local updates to mitigate the client drift arising from data heterogeneity. The entire architecture avoids the complex subproblems of primal-dual alternatives. The theoretical analysis provides the first rigorous convergence guarantees for this proximal-skipping framework in the general non-convex setting.

This paper presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the attractor landscape in KLR-trained networks to establish a solid foundation for their design and application. Through extensive, statistically validated simulations, we address critical questions of generality, scalability, and robustness. Our comparative analysis shows that KLR and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) exhibit similarly high storage capacities and clean attractor landscapes under typical operating conditions, suggesting that this behavior is a general property of kernel regression methods, although KRR is computationally much faster. We identify a non-trivial, scale-dependent law for the kernel width $\\gamma$, demonstrating that optimal capacity requires $\\gamma$ to be scaled such that $\\gamma N$ increases with network size $N$. This finding implies that larger networks require more localized kernels, in which each pattern's influence is more spatially confined, to mitigate inter-pattern interference. Under this optimized scaling, we provide clear evidence that storage capacity scales linearly with network size~($P \\propto N$). Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis shows that performance is remarkably robust with respect to the choice of the regularization parameter $\\lambda$.

While value-based algorithms have achieved notable success in domains such as the Arcade Learning Environment, the combinatorial optimization community has predominantly favored policy-gradient algorithms, often overlooking the potential of value-based alternatives. From our results, value-based algorithms demonstrated a lower variance and a more stable convergence profile compared to policy-gradient ones.

For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the classifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a \"garbage\" class, initially populated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each training epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images corresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and incoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the classifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues iteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution data more closely, with a significant drop in the uncertainty, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out meaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing OOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme enables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying them into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with each prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution and OOD inputs.

However, most building-sector testbeds target single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistanc-Capacitance) or data-driven approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance. Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse control scenarios.

In this work, we propose $\\textit{RegCache}$, a training-free algorithm that mitigates outliers in large-scale pretrained vision encoders and serves as a plug-in module that can be applied on top of other quantization methods. The proposed RegCache introduces outlier-prone yet semantically meaningless prefix tokens to the target vision encoder, which prevents other tokens from having outliers.

Instead, we propose releasing private sketches of the datasets, which can then be used to compute an approximate solution to the regression problem. This is motivated by the \\emph{sketch-and-solve} paradigm, where the regression problem is solved on a smaller sketch of the dataset instead of on the original problem space. The solution obtained on the sketch can also be shown to have good approximation guarantees to the original problem. Various sketching methods have been developed for improving the computational efficiency of linear regression problems under this paradigm. We adopt this paradigm for the purpose of releasing private sketches of the data. We construct differentially private sketches for the problems of least squares regression, as well as least absolute deviations regression.

In view of this, we first time propose recursive decision-focused learning (R-DFL), a novel framework that introduces bidirectional feedback between downstream optimization and upstream prediction. We further extend two distinct differentiation methods: explicit unrolling via automatic differentiation and implicit differentiation based on fixed-point methods, to facilitate efficient gradient propagation in R-DFL.

This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from H independent O(N^2) computations into a single, collaborative O(N^2) computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of H. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Our work demonstrates that thoughtfully designed structural sparsity can serve as an effective inductive bias that simultaneously improves both computational efficiency and model performance, opening a new avenue for the architectural design of next-generation, high-performance LLMs."}

Accuracy is no longer tied to a fixed, extremely small MD time step; instead, it is controlled by two scalable knobs: model capacity, which governs how well the drift is approximated, and the number of denoising steps, which sets the integrator resolution. In practice, this leads to a fully data-driven MD framework that learns forces from uncorrelated equilibrium snapshots, requires no hand-engineered force fields, uses no trajectory data for training, and still preserves the Boltzmann distribution associated with the learned energy.We derive trajectory-level, information-theoretic error bounds that cleanly separate discretization error from score-model error, clarify how temperature enters through the effective spring, and show that the resulting sampler generates molecular trajectories with MD-like temporal correlations, even though the model is trained only on static configurations."}

In particular, it is poorly understood which input features agents rely on, how these dependencies evolve during training, and how they relate to behavior. We introduce a scientific methodology for analyzing the learning process through quantitative analysis of saliency. This approach aggregates saliency information at the object and modality level into hierarchical attention profiles, quantifying how agents allocate attention over time, thereby forming attention trajectories throughout training. Applied to Atari benchmarks, custom Pong environments, and muscle-actuated biomechanical user simulations in visuomotor interactive tasks, this methodology uncovers algorithm-specific attention biases, reveals unintended reward-driven strategies, and diagnoses overfitting to redundant sensory channels. These patterns correspond to measurable behavioral differences, demonstrating empirical links between attention profiles, learning dynamics, and agent behavior. To assess robustness of the attention profiles, we validate our findings across multiple saliency methods and environments. The results establish attention trajectories as a promising diagnostic axis for tracing how feature reliance develops during training and for identifying biases and vulnerabilities invisible to performance metrics alone."}

Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute \"delta\" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation.

In this paper, we first identify causes of the above interference, and hypothesize that correlations between data representations are a key factor of interference. We then propose a method for promoting appropriate correlations between arbitrary tasks' data representations (i.e., global alignment) in individual task learning. Specifically, we learn the data representation as a task-specific composition of pre-trained token representations shared across all tasks. Then the correlations between different tasks' data representations are grounded by correlations between pre-trained token representations. We explore different ways to learn such compositions.

Our work extends the classical Local Rademacher Complexity (LRC) to the transductive setting, incorporating substantial and novel components beyond standard inductive LRC analysis. Although LRC has been used to obtain sharp generalization bounds and minimax rates for inductive tasks such as classification and nonparametric regression, it has remained an open problem whether a localized Rademacher complexity framework can be effectively adapted to transductive learning to achieve sharp or nearly sharp bounds consistent with inductive results. We provide an affirmative answer via TLC. TLC is constructed by first deriving a new concentration inequality in Theorem 4.1 for the supremum of empirical processes capturing the gap between test and training losses, termed the test-train process, under uniform sampling without replacement, which leverages a novel combinatorial property of the test-train process and a new proof strategy applying the exponential Efron-Stein inequality twice. A subsequent peeling strategy and a new surrogate variance operator then yield excess risk bounds in the transductive setting that are nearly consistent with classical LRC-based inductive bounds up to a logarithmic gap. We further advance transductive learning through two applications: (1) for realizable transductive learning over binary-valued classes with finite VC dimension and $u \\ge m \\ge \\dVC$ where $u$ and $m$ are the number of test features and training features, our Theorem 6.1 gives a nearly optimal bound $\\Theta(\\dVC \\log(me/\\dVC)/m)$ matching the minimax rate $\\Theta(\\dVC/m)$ up to $\\log m$, resolving a decade-old open question; and (2) Theorem 6.3 presents a sharper excess risk bound for transductive kernel learning compared to the current state-of-the-art."}

Despite their ubiquitous use and reliability, CANs are susceptible to sophisticated cyberattacks, particularly masquerade attacks, which inject false data that mimic legitimate messages at the expected frequency. These attacks pose severe risks such as unintended acceleration, brake deactivation, and rogue steering. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to detect these subtle intrusions due to their seamless integration into normal traffic. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting masquerade attacks in the CAN bus using graph machine learning (ML). We hypothesize that the integration of shallow graph embeddings with time series features derived from CAN frames enhances the detection of masquerade attacks. We show that by representing CAN bus frames as message sequence graphs (MSGs) and enriching each node with contextual statistical attributes from time series, we can enhance detection capabilities across various attack patterns compared to using graph-based features only. Our method ensures a comprehensive and dynamic analysis of CAN frame interactions, improving robustness and efficiency.

In this paper, we propose an annotation-free method, FreeGaussian, which mathematically disentangles camera egomotion and articulated movements via flow derivatives. By establishing a connection between 2D flows and 3D Gaussian dynamic flow, our method enables optimization and continuity of dynamic Gaussian motions from flow priors without any control signals. Furthermore, we introduce a 3D spherical vector controlling scheme, which represents the state as a 3D Gaussian trajectory, thereby eliminating the need for complex 1D control signal calculations and simplifying controllable Gaussian modeling.

With the recent success of machine learning in expert assistance systems where sensed information is wirelessly provided to a human to assist task execution, the need to design effective and efficient communications has become increasingly apparent. In particular, semantic communication aims to convey the meaning behind the sensed information relevant for Human Decision-Making (HDM). Regarding the interplay between semantic communication and HDM, many questions remain, such as how to model the entire end-to-end sensing-decision-making process, how to design semantic communication for the HDM and which information should be provided for HDM. To address these questions, we propose to integrate semantic communication and HDM into one probabilistic end-to-end sensing-decision framework that bridges communications and psychology. In our interdisciplinary framework, we model the human through a HDM process, allowing us to explore how feature extraction from semantic communication can best support HDM both in theory and in simulations. In this sense, our study reveals the fundamental design trade-off between maximizing the relevant semantic information and matching the cognitive capabilities of the HDM model. Our initial analysis shows how semantic communication can balance the level of detail with human cognitive capabilities while demanding less bandwidth, power, and latency."}

Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning outputs uncovers new kinds of failures. DeepSeek R1, for instance, often concedes with \"I give up\" before providing an answer that it knows is wrong. R1 can also be remarkably \"uncertain\" in its output and in rare cases, it does not \"finish thinking,\" which suggests the need for techniques to ``wrap up'' before the context window limit is reached.

We show that one-shot learning for $k$-SAT is infeasible well below the satisfiability threshold; in fact, we obtain impossibility results for degrees $d$ as low as $k^2$ when $\\beta$ is sufficiently large, and bootstrap this to small values of $\\beta$ when $d$ scales exponentially with $k$, via a probabilistic construction.

We introduce DyNoSeD, a first-principles framework that identifies unknown dynamical parameters from such non-sequential data by minimizing Fokker-Planck residuals. We develop two complementary routes: a local route that handles region-restricted data via locally estimated scores, and a global route that fits dynamics from globally sampled data using a kernel Stein discrepancy without explicit density or score estimation. When the dynamics are affine in the unknown parameters, we prove a necessary-and-sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of the inferred parameters and derive a sensitivity analysis that identifies which parameters are tightly constrained by the data and which remain effectively free under over-parameterization. For general non-affine case, both routes define differentiable losses amenable to gradient-based optimization. As demonstrations, we recover (i) the three parameters of a stochastic Lorenz system from non-sequential data (region-restricted data for the local route and full steady-state data for the global route) and (ii) a 3x7interaction matrix of a nonlinear gene-regulatory network derived from a published B-cell differentiation model, using only unordered steady-state samples and applying the global route.

ForAug is constructed by using pretrained foundation models to separate and recombine foreground objects with different backgrounds. This recombination step enables us to take fine-grained control over object position and size, as well as background selection.

To address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{CA}usal \\textbf{MA}thematician (\\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit, reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs the \\textbf{M}athematical \\textbf{C}ausal \\textbf{G}raph (\\textbf{MCG}), a high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies. To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph, which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations alone."}

To this end, we perform a controlled study that scales the vocabulary of the language model from 24K to 196K while holding data, computation, and optimization unchanged. We begin by quantifying the complexity of tokenized text -- formalized via Kolmogorov complexity -- and show that larger vocabularies reduce this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already tokenized as a single token, so enlarging vocabulary only deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. Word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce cross-entropy loss almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. The same frequent words cover roughly 75% of tokens in downstream benchmarks, so this training advantage transfers intact. We further show that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same frequent-word benefit. Our results recast \"bigger vocabularies help\" as \"lowering complexity of tokenized text helps,\" offering a simple, principled knob for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics that govern language model scaling in pre-training."}

However, such series architectures suffer from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and expands model expressivity.

Machine learning potentials (MLPs), with their capacity to capture many-body interactions, can provide accurate approximations of the potential of mean force (PMF) in CG models. Current CG MLPs are typically trained in a bottom-up manner via force matching, which in practice relies on configurations sampled from the unbiased equilibrium Boltzmann distribution to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This convention poses two key limitations: first, sufficiently long atomistic trajectories are needed to reach convergence; and second, even once equilibrated, transition regions remain poorly sampled. To address these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of freedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the unbiased potential. This strategy simultaneously shortens the simulation time required to produce equilibrated data and enriches sampling in transition regions, while preserving the correct PMF. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the Müller-Brown potential and capped alanine, achieving notable improvements. Our findings support the use of enhanced sampling for force matching as a promising direction to improve the accuracy and reliability of CG MLPs."}

Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured, automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from 37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents.

Genuine general intelligence, however, requires coherent sufficiency: balanced competence across all essential faculties. We introduce a coherence-based measure of AGI that integrates the generalized mean over a continuum of compensability exponents. This yields an area-under-the-curve (AUC) metric spanning arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, quantifying how robust an evaluated capability remains as compensability assumptions become stricter. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and exposes bottlenecks that constrain performance. To illustrate the framework, we apply it to cognitive profiles derived from the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model, showing how coherence-based aggregation highlights imbalances that are obscured by arithmetic averaging. As a second, independent example, we apply the same methodology to a set of 17 heterogeneous benchmarks, demonstrating how coherence-based evaluation can reveal unevenness even in narrower task collections. These examples show that the proposed approach offers a principled, interpretable, and stricter foundation for measuring progress toward AGI."}

Most existing methods for spatio-temporal causal inference assume that all confounders are observed, an assumption that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs), a novel graphical framework that extends hierarchical causal modeling to the spatio-temporal domain. At the core of our approach is the Spatio-Temporal Collapse Theorem, which shows that a complex ST-HCM converges to a simpler flat causal model as the amount of subunit data increases. This theoretical result enables a general procedure for causal identification, allowing ST-HCMs to recover causal effects even in the presence of unobserved, time-invariant unit-level confounders, a scenario where standard non-hierarchical models fail.

While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we approximate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks ($+$2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing chain-of-thought reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller $\\Delta$ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first benchmarking study to systematically integrate structured prompting into an established evaluation framework, demonstrating how scalable performance-ceiling approximation yields more robust, decision-useful benchmarks.

To more rapidly drive progress in solving these issues, domain scientists and machine learning researchers opened up the offline aspect of this problem to the broader machine learning and data science community with the release of ClimSim, a NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks publication, and an associated Kaggle competition. This paper reports on the downstream results of the Kaggle competition by coupling emulators inspired by the winning teams' architectures to an interactive climate model (including full cloud microphysics, a regime historically prone to online instability) and systematically evaluating their online performance. Our results demonstrate that online stability in the low-resolution, real-geography setting is reproducible across multiple diverse architectures, which we consider a key milestone. All tested architectures exhibit strikingly similar offline and online biases, though their responses to architecture-agnostic design choices (e.g., expanding the list of input variables) can differ significantly.

We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism. Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs. To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference.

The objectives of this study are to (i) develop an Large Language Models (LLMs)-based framework capable of performing accurate and efficient code refactoring across multiple languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Java), (ii) investigate the impact of prompt engineering (Temperature, Different shot algorithm) and instruction fine-tuning on refactoring effectiveness, and (iii) evaluate the quality improvements (Compilability, Correctness, Distance, Similarity, Number of Lines, Token, Character, Cyclomatic Complexity) in refactored code through empirical metrics and human assessment.

Frameworks and standards, such as the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC), ID-Link and Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) provide a strong foundation to realize this ecosystem. However, a major open challenge is the practical description and enforcement of context-dependent data usage policies using these base technologies - especially by domain experts without software engineering backgrounds. Therefore, this article proposes a method for leveraging domain-specific languages (DSLs) to enable declarative, human-readable, and machine-executable policy definitions for sovereign data sharing via data space connectors.

We define ExtremelyBuggy methods as those involved in more than one bug fix and present the first large-scale study of their prevalence, characteristics, and predictability. Using a dataset of over 1.25 million methods from 98 open-source Java projects, we find that ExtremelyBuggy methods constitute only a tiny fraction of all methods, yet frequently account for a disproportionately large share of bugs. At their inception, these methods are significantly larger, more complex, less readable, and less maintainable than both singly-buggy and non-buggy methods. However, despite these measurable differences, a comprehensive evaluation of five machine learning models shows that early prediction of ExtremelyBuggy methods remains highly unreliable due to data imbalance, project heterogeneity, and the fact that many bugs emerge through subsequent evolution rather than initial implementation. To complement these quantitative findings, we conduct a thematic analysis of 265 ExtremelyBuggy methods, revealing recurring visual issues (e.g., confusing control flow, poor readability), contextual roles (e.g., core logic, data transformation, external resource handling), and common defect patterns (e.g., faulty conditionals, fragile error handling, misuse of variables).

Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) has gained prominence due to its robust theoretical foundations and fine-grained analysis capabilities. However, recent studies have identified a critical challenge: noise phenomena, specifically the false kill relationships between mutants and tests, which significantly degrade localization effectiveness. While several approaches have been proposed to rectify the final localization results, they do not directly address the underlying noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to refine the kill matrix, a core data structure capturing mutant-test relationships in MBFL, by treating it as a signal that contains both meaningful fault-related patterns and high-frequency noise. Inspired by signal processing theory, we introduce DKMR (Denoising-based Kill Matrix Refinement), which employs two key stages: (1) signal enhancement through hybrid matrix construction to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for better denoising, and (2) signal denoising via frequency domain filtering to suppress noise while preserving fault-related patterns. Building on this foundation, we develop MBFL-DKMR, a fault localization framework that utilizes the refined matrix with fuzzy values for suspiciousness calculation. Our evaluation on Defects4J v2.0.0 demonstrates that MBFL-DKMR effectively mitigates the noise and outperforms the state-of-the-art MBFL techniques. Specifically, MBFL-DKMR achieves 129 faults localized at Top-1 compared to 85 for BLMu and 103 for Delta4Ms, with negligible additional computational overhead (0.11 seconds, 0.001\\% of total time). This work highlights the potential of signal processing techniques to enhance the effectiveness of MBFL by refining the kill matrix."}

Automated detection methods can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs; however, existing approaches still face several challenges, including low detection accuracy on imbalanced data, limited semantic extraction due to the use of a single encoder, and suboptimal performance in cross-domain transfer learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Transferable Software Requirement Conflict Detection Framework based on SBERT and SimCSE, termed TSRCDF-SS. First, the framework employs two independent encoders, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and Simple Contrastive Sentence Embedding (SimCSE), to generate sentence embeddings for requirement pairs, followed by a six-element concatenation strategy. Furthermore, the classifier is enhanced by a two-layer fully connected feedforward neural network (FFNN) with a hybrid loss optimization strategy that integrates a variant of Focal Loss, domain-specific constraints, and a confidence-based penalty term. Finally, the framework synergistically integrates sequential and cross-domain transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 10.4% improvement in both macro-F1 and weighted-F1 scores in in-domain settings, and an 11.4% increase in macro-F1 in cross-domain scenarios."}

These mutants mimic the test sensitivity behaviors of real faulty code entities and weaken the effectiveness of fault localization. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Fault Localization Interference Mutants (FLIMs) and conduct a theoretical analysis based on the Reachability, Infection, Propagation, and Revealability (RIPR) model, identifying four distinct interference causes. Building on this, we propose a novel approach to semantically recognize and mitigate FLIMs using LLM-based semantic analysis, enhanced by fine-tuning techniques and confidence estimation strategies to address LLM output instability.

This often fails to fully capture user intent and makes it difficult to identify suitable models when developers also consider factors such as bias mitigation, hardware requirements, or license compliance. To address the limitations of keyword-based model search, we propose PTMPicker to accurately identify suitable PTMs. We first define a structured template composed of common and essential attributes for PTMs and then PTMPicker represents both candidate models and user-intended features (i.e., model search requests) in this unified format. To determine whether candidate models satisfy user requirements, it computes embedding similarities for function-related attributes and uses well-crafted prompts to evaluate special constraints such as license compliance and hardware requirements. We scraped a total of 543,949 pretrained models from Hugging Face to prepare valid candidates for selection. PTMPicker then represented them in the predefined structured format by extracting their associated descriptions. Guided by the extracted metadata, we synthesized a total of 15,207 model search requests with carefully designed prompts, as no such search requests are readily available. Experiments on the curated PTM dataset and the synthesized model search requests show that PTMPicker can help users effectively identify models,with 85% of the sampled requests successfully locating appropriate PTMs within the top-10 ranked candidates."}

We present LADEX (LLM-based Activity Diagram Extractor), a pipeline for deriving activity diagrams from natural-language process descriptions using an LLM-driven critique-refine process. Structural checks in LADEX can be performed either algorithmically or by an LLM, while alignment checks are performed by an LLM.

In this paper, we present CAFD, a novel and lightweight technique that enhances pointer analysis by automatically detecting side-effect-free custom allocation functions. CAFD employs a hybrid approach: it uses value-flow analysis to detect straightforward wrappers and leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason about more complex allocation patterns with side effects, ensuring that only side-effect-free functions are modeled as allocators. This targeted enhancement enables precise modeling of heap objects at each call site, achieving context-sensitivity-like benefits without significant overhead.

Kapitsaki,Evangelia Vanezi", "title": "FOSS-chain: using blockchain for Open Source Software license compliance", "abstract": "Open Source Software (OSS) is widely used and carries licenses that indicate the terms under which the software is provided for use, also specifying modification and distribution rules. Ensuring that users are respecting OSS license terms when creating derivative works is a complex process. Compliance issues arising from incompatibilities among licenses may lead to legal disputes. At the same time, the blockchain technology with immutable entries offers a mechanism to provide transparency when it comes to licensing and ensure software changes are recorded. In this work, we are introducing an integration of blockchain and license management when creating derivative works, in order to tackle the issue of OSS license compatibility. We have designed, implemented and performed a preliminary evaluation of FOSS-chain, a web platform that uses blockchain and automates the license compliance process, covering 14 OSS licenses. We have evaluated the initial prototype version of the FOSS-chain platform via a small scale user study. Our preliminary results are promising, demonstrating the potential of the platform for adaptation on realistic software systems."}

This dissertation optimizes human-AI programming roles through self-determination theory and personality psychology, introducing the Role Optimization Motivation Alignment (ROMA) framework.Through Design Science Research spanning five cycles, this work establishes empirically-validated connections between personality traits, programming role preferences, and collaborative outcomes, engaging 200 experimental participants and 46 interview respondents.Key findings demonstrate that personality-driven role optimization significantly enhances self-determination and team dynamics, yielding 23% average motivation increases among professionals and up to 65% among undergraduates. Five distinct personality archetypes emerge: The Explorer (high Openness/low Agreeableness), The Orchestrator (high Extraversion/Agreeableness), The Craftsperson (high Neuroticism/low Extraversion), The Architect (high Conscientiousness), and The Adapter (balanced profile). Each exhibits distinct preferences for programming roles (Co-Pilot, Co-Navigator, Agent), with assignment modes proving crucial for satisfaction.The dissertation contributes: (1) an empirically-validated framework linking personality traits to role preferences and self-determination outcomes; (2) a taxonomy of AI collaboration modalities mapped to personality profiles while preserving human agency; and (3) an ISO/IEC 29110 extension enabling Very Small Entities to implement personality-driven role optimization within established standards.Keywords: artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, behavioral software engineering, self-determination theory, personality psychology, phenomenology, intrinsic motivation, pair programming, design science research, ISO/IEC 29110"}

However, the inherent hallucination and reliability issues of AI continue to raise persistent concerns. Consequently, application users and regulators increasingly ask critical questions such as: Does the application incorporate AI capabilities? and What specific types of AI functionalities are embedded? Preliminary efforts have been made to identify AI capabilities in mobile software; however, existing approaches mainly rely on manual inspection and rule-based heuristics. These methods are not only costly and time-consuming but also struggle to adapt advanced AI techniques.To address the limitations of existing methods, we propose LLMAID (Large Language Model for AI Discovery). LLMAID includes four main tasks: (1) candidate extraction, (2) knowledge base interaction, (3) AI capability analysis and detection, and (4) AI service summarization. We apply LLMAID to a dataset of 4,201 Android applications and demonstrate that it identifies 242% more real-world AI apps than state-of-the-art rule-based approaches. Our experiments show that LLM4AID achieves high precision and recall, both exceeding 90%, in detecting AI-related components. Additionally, a user study indicates that developers find the AI service summaries generated by LLMAID to be more informative and preferable to the original app descriptions. Finally, we leverage LLMAID to perform an empirical analysis of AI capabilities across Android apps. The results reveal a strong concentration of AI functionality in computer vision (54.80%), with object detection emerging as the most common task (25.19%)."}

Meinicke", "title": "Reasoning about expression evaluation under interference", "abstract": "Hoare-style inference rules for program constructs permit the copying of expressions and tests from program text into logical contexts. It is known that this requires care even for sequential programs but much more serious issues arise with concurrent programs because of potential interference to the values of variables. The \"rely-guarantee\" approach tackles the challenge of recording acceptable interference and offers a way to provide safe inference rules for concurrent constructs. This paper shows how the algebraic presentation of rely-guarantee ideas can clarify and formalise the conditions for safely re-using expressions and tests from program text in logical contexts for reasoning about concurrent programs; crucially this extends to handling expressions that reference more than one shared variable. A non-trivial example related to the Fischer-Galler forest representation of equivalence relations is treated."}

This symbolic search is fundamentally limited by its inability to directly reason about program behavior. We introduce Gradient-Based Program Repair (GBPR), a new paradigm that reframes program repair as continuous optimization in a differentiable numerical program space. Our core insight is to compile symbolic programs into differentiable numerical representations, enabling search in the numerical program space directly guided by program behavior. To evaluate GBPR, we present RaspBugs, a new benchmark of 1,466 buggy symbolic RASP programs and their respective numerical representations. Our experiments demonstrate that GBPR can effectively repair buggy symbolic programs by gradient-based optimization in the numerical program space, with convincing repair trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first to state program repair as continuous optimization in a numerical program space. Our work establishes a new direction for program repair research, bridging two rich worlds: continuous optimization and program behavior."}

While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative representations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for quantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory offers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept, modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental testing across power and logarithmic value function specifications, demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications achieve validation score 59/60 compared to power functions (55/60), with both demonstrating strong empirical fit to S-LCD historical patterns. This technical report serves as the foundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic coopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with companion work addressing trust dynamics, team production, and reciprocity mechanisms."}
