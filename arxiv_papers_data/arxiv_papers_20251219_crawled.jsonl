This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring \"VSA-likeness\" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems."}

We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings."}

Prior research calls for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly agentic AI, offers a promising path forward. Agentic AI systems consist of autonomous, specialized agents capable of solving complex, dynamic tasks. While past systems have relied on single-agent models or have used multi-agent frameworks only for static functions, there is a growing need for architectures that support dynamic collaborative reasoning and context-aware outputs. To bridge this gap, we present AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system for climate adaptation decision support in agriculture, with a focus on vulnerable rural communities. AgroAskAI features a modular, role-specialized architecture that uses a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating real-time tools and datasets. The system has built-in governance mechanisms that mitigate hallucination and enable internal feedback for coherent, locally relevant strategies. The system also supports multilingual interactions, making it accessible to non-English-speaking farmers.

In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models."}

However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks."}

Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline."}

The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial.

Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that \"Perception Errors\" were dominant, highlighting a \"Perception-Cognition Gap\" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a \"Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy,\" successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and \"Process Hallucination,\" where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing \"AI-resistant questions\" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities.

While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty."}

To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity.

Existing approaches to scalable interpretability use hand-designed agents that make and test hypotheses about how internal activations relate to external behavior. We propose to instead turn this task into an end-to-end training objective, by training interpretability assistants to accurately predict model behavior from activations through a communication bottleneck. Specifically, an encoder compresses activations to a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder reads this list and answers a natural language question about the model. We show how to pretrain this assistant on large unstructured data, then finetune it to answer questions. The resulting architecture, which we call a Predictive Concept Decoder, enjoys favorable scaling properties: the auto-interp score of the bottleneck concepts improves with data, as does the performance on downstream applications. Specifically, PCDs can detect jailbreaks, secret hints, and implanted latent concepts, and are able to accurately surface latent user attributes."}

This study conducts a comparative legal analysis of criminal liability for AI-mediated greenwashing across India, the US, and the EU, exposing doctrinal lacunae in attributing culpability when deceptive claims originate from algorithmic systems. Existing statutes exhibit anthropocentric biases by predicating liability on demonstrable human intent, rendering them ill-equipped to address algorithmic deception. The research identifies a critical gap in jurisprudential adaptation, as prevailing fraud statutes remain antiquated vis-à-vis AI-generated misrepresentation. Utilising a doctrinal legal methodology, this study systematically dissects judicial precedents and statutory instruments, yielding results regarding the potential expansion of corporate criminal liability. Findings underscore the viability of strict liability models, recalibrated governance frameworks for AI accountability, and algorithmic due diligence mandates under ESG regimes. Comparative insights reveal jurisdictional disparities, with the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) offering a potential transnational model.

In this work, we present a rigorous architectural comparison between End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking for sepsis tasks. We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from \"attention starvation\" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \\approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a \"leaner\" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the \"Historian\" (Static), the \"Monitor\" (Temporal), and the \"Reader\" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC).

However, the complex nature of ship-radiated and environmental underwater noise poses significant challenges to accurate signal processing. While recent advancements in machine learning have improved classification accuracy, issues such as limited dataset availability and a lack of standardised experimentation hinder generalisation and robustness. This paper introduces GSE ResNeXt, a deep learning architecture integrating learnable Gabor convolutional layers with a ResNeXt backbone enhanced by squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms. The Gabor filters serve as two-dimensional adaptive band-pass filters, extending the feature channel representation. Its combination with channel attention improves training stability and convergence while enhancing the model's ability to extract discriminative features. The model is evaluated on three classification tasks of increasing complexity. In particular, the impact of temporal differences between the training and testing data is explored, revealing that the distance between the vessel and sensor significantly affects performance. Results show that, GSE ResNeXt consistently outperforms baseline models like Xception, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, in terms of classification performance. Regarding stability and convergence, the addition of Gabor convolutions in the initial layers of the model represents a 28% reduction in training time. These results emphasise the importance of signal processing strategies in improving the reliability and generalisation of models under different environmental conditions, especially in data-limited underwater acoustic classification scenarios. Future developments should focus on mitigating the impact of environmental factors on input signals."}

This work, for the first time, investigates how low-level, bitwise perturbations (fault injection) to the weights of a large language model (LLM) used for image captioning can influence the semantic meaning of its generated descriptions while preserving grammatical structure. While prior fault analysis methods have shown that flipping a few bits can crash classifiers or degrade accuracy, these approaches overlook the semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. In image captioning models, a single flipped bit might subtly alter how visual features map to words, shifting the entire narrative an AI tells about the world. We hypothesize that such semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable. That is, the model's own gradients can predict which bits, if perturbed, will most strongly influence meaning while leaving syntax and fluency intact. We design a differentiable fault analysis framework, BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation), that uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits and then refines their selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. Our goal is not merely to corrupt captions, but to understand how meaning itself is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level, revealing that even imperceptible low-level changes can steer the high-level semantics of generative vision-language models. It also opens pathways for robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI, by exposing how structured bit-level faults can reshape a model's semantic output."}

To address these, we propose \\textbf{SEED}, a Spectral Entropy-guided Evaluation framework for spatial-temporal Dependency modeling. SEED introduces a Dependency Evaluator, a key innovation that leverages spectral entropy to dynamically provide a preliminary evaluation of the spatial and temporal dependencies of each variable, enabling the model to adaptively balance Channel Independence (CI) and Channel Dependence (CD) strategies. To account for temporal regularities originating from the influence of other variables rather than intrinsic dynamics, we propose Spectral Entropy-based Fuser to further refine the evaluated dependency weights, effectively separating this part. Moreover, to preserve negative correlations, we introduce a Signed Graph Constructor that enables signed edge weights, overcoming the limitations of softmax. Finally, to help variables perceive their temporal positions and thereby construct more comprehensive spatial features, we introduce the Context Spatial Extractor, which leverages local contextual windows to extract spatial features.

As interpretability and robustness gain increasing importance, explanation-guided learning has emerged as an effective framework by introducing attribution-based supervision during training; however, deriving general and reliable attribution priors remains a significant challenge. Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features. Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently enhances both interpretability and robustness."}

CP works by converting predictions of a ML model, together with a calibration sample, into prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true label with any desired probability. An often cited advantage is that CP theory holds for calibration samples of arbitrary size, suggesting that uncertainty estimates with practically meaningful statistical guarantees can be achieved even if only small calibration sets are available. We question this promise by showing that, although the statistical guarantees hold for calibration sets of arbitrary size, the practical utility of these guarantees does highly depend on the size of the calibration set. This observation is relevant in medical domains because data is often scarce and obtaining large calibration sets is therefore infeasible.

Here, we establish a hierarchical cross-scale framework for the preoperative identification of DCCD-ccRCC. At the highest layer, cross-modal mapping transferred molecular signatures to histological and CT phenotypes, establishing a molecular-to-pathology-to-radiology supervisory bridge. Within this framework, each modality-specific model is designed to mirror the inherent hierarchical structure of tumor biology. PathoDCCD captured multi-scale microscopic features, from cellular morphology and tissue architecture to meso-regional organization. RadioDCCD integrated complementary macroscopic information by combining whole-tumor and its habitat-subregions radiomics with a 2D maximal-section heterogeneity metric. These nested models enabled integrated molecular subtype prediction and clinical risk stratification. Across five cohorts totaling 1,659 patients, PathoDCCD reliably recapitulated molecular subtypes, while RadioDCCD provided reliable preoperative prediction.

Empirical analysis shows that adversarial prompts optimized on the pretrained model transfer most effectively to its finetuned variants, revealing inherited vulnerabilities from pretrained to finetuned LLMs. To further examine this inheritance, we conduct representation-level probing, which shows that transferable prompts are linearly separable within the pretrained hidden states, suggesting that universal transferability is encoded in pretrained representations.

We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute.

While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \\cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage.

This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points.

Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success.

In Vertical FL (VFL), where each party holds different features for the same users, a key challenge is to evaluate the feature contribution of each party before any model is trained, particularly in the early stages when no model exists. To address this, the Shapley-CMI method was recently proposed as a model-free, information-theoretic approach to feature valuation using Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). However, its original formulation did not provide a practical implementation capable of computing the required permutations and intersections securely. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving implementation of Shapley-CMI for VFL. Our system introduces a private set intersection (PSI) server that performs all necessary feature permutations and computes encrypted intersection sizes across discretized and encrypted ID groups, without the need for raw data exchange. Each party then uses these intersection results to compute Shapley-CMI values, computing the marginal utility of their features. Initial experiments confirm the correctness and privacy of the proposed system, demonstrating its viability for secure and efficient feature contribution estimation in VFL. This approach ensures data confidentiality, scales across multiple parties, and enables fair data valuation without requiring the sharing of raw data or training models."}

A Structural Rebuttal to OpenAI's Hallucination Thesis", "abstract": "OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility."}

Conventional ML frameworks in cement research are typically restricted to a single data modality. Graph neural network (GNN) represents a new generation of neural architectures capable of learning from data structured as graphs, capturing relationships through irregular or topology-dependent connections rather than fixed spatial coordinates. While GNN is inherently designed for graphical data, they can be adapted to extract correlations from numerical datasets and potentially embed physical laws directly into their architecture, enabling explainable and physics-informed predictions. This work is among the first few studies to implement GNNs to design concrete, with a particular emphasis on establishing a clear and reproducible pathway for converting tabular data into graph representations using the k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) approach.

We present Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-geometric framework that unifies these phenomena. We model the closed loop as a stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Without external coupling, finite-sample noise forces the system to project onto an ever-shrinking empirical support, causing exponential entropy decay and eventual collapse. Introducing an Entropy Reservoir -- a high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection -- injects a controllable entropy flux that provably stabilises the dynamics. Our theory yields (i) a necessary condition for collapse, (ii) a sufficient condition that guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor, and (iii) closed-form rates that depend only on sample size and the strong-convexity/Lipschitz constants of the Bregman generator. Experiments on large-language-model self-training, Soft Actor-Critic in reinforcement learning, and GAN optimisation validate our predictions and show that disparate stabilisation heuristics correspond to specific reservoir choices and coupling coefficients. ERBP thus transforms a collection of folk remedies into a single, quantitative design rule: monitor and budget your entropy flux."}

We also investigate scenarios involving drift, where the underlying patterns in the data evolve over time, conduct convergence analysis, and compare our approach with existing online regression models. The results of OLR-WA demonstrate its ability to achieve performance comparable to the batch regression, while also showcasing comparable or superior performance when compared with other state-of-the-art online models, thus establishing its effectiveness. Moreover, OLR-WA exhibits exceptional performance in terms of rapid convergence, surpassing other online models with consistently achieving high r2 values as a performance measure from the first iteration to the last iteration, even when initialized with minimal amount of data points, as little as 1% to 10% of the total data points. In addition to its ability to handle time-based (temporal drift) scenarios, remarkably, OLR-WA stands out as the only model capable of effectively managing confidence-based challenging scenarios. It achieves this by adopting a conservative approach in its updates, giving priority to older data points with higher confidence levels.

Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified.

Existing approaches either rely on static sampling or heuristics that neglect the dynamic evolution of biological processes, leading to inefficiencies and missed events. Here, we introduce the restless multi-process multi-armed bandit (RMPMAB), a new decision-theoretic framework in which each experimental region is modeled not as a single process but as an ensemble of Markov chains, thereby capturing the inherent heterogeneity of biological systems such as asynchronous cell cycles and heterogeneous drug responses. Building upon this foundation, we derive closed-form expressions for transient and asymptotic behaviors of aggregated processes, and design scalable Whittle index policies with sub-linear complexity in the number of imaging regions. Through both simulations and a real biological live-cell imaging dataset, we show that our approach achieves substantial improvements in throughput under resource constraints. Notably, our algorithm outperforms Thomson Sampling, Bayesian UCB, epsilon-Greedy, and Round Robin by reducing cumulative regret by more than 37% in simulations and capturing 93% more biologically relevant events in live imaging experiments, underscoring its potential for transformative smart microscopy.

With more LLM users, the KV cache footprint can easily exceed GPU memory capacity, so prior work has proposed to either evict KV cache to lower-tier storage devices, or compress KV cache so that more KV cache can be fit in the fast memory. However, prior work misses an important opportunity: jointly optimizing the eviction and compression decisions across all KV caches to minimize average generation latency without hurting quality.We propose EVICPRESS, a KV-cache management system that applies lossy compression and adaptive eviction to KV cache across multiple storage tiers. Specifically, for each KV cache of a context, EVICPRESS considers the effect of compression and eviction of the KV cache on the average generation quality and delay across all contexts as a whole. To achieve this, EVICPRESS proposes a unified utility function that quantifies the effect of quality and delay of the lossy compression or eviction. To this end, EVICPRESS's profiling module periodically updates the utility function scores on all possible eviction-compression configurations for all contexts and places KV caches using a fast heuristic to rearrange KV caches on all storage tiers, with the goal of maximizing the utility function scores on each storage tier. Compared to the baselines that evict KV cache or compress KV cache, EVICPRESS achieves higher KV-cache hit rates on fast devices, i.e., lower delay, while preserving high generation quality by applying conservative compression to contexts that are sensitive to compression errors. Evaluation on 12 datasets and 5 models demonstrates that EVICPRESS achieves up to 2.19x faster time-to-first-token (TTFT) at equivalent generation quality."}

Interpretable Watermark Detection at the Block Level", "abstract": "Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image."}

Prior work has demonstrated single-model collapse, defined as performance decay in an AI model trained on its own output. Inspired by ecology, we ask whether AI ecosystem diversity, that is, diversity among models, can mitigate such a collapse. We build on the single-model approach but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. To study the effect of diversity on model performance, we segment the training data across language models and evaluate the resulting ecosystems over ten, self-training iterations. We find that increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but, interestingly, only up to an optimal level. Our results suggest that an ecosystem containing only a few diverse models fails to express the rich mixture of the full, true distribution, resulting in rapid performance decay. Yet distributing the data across too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity on the true distribution, leading to poor performance already in the first iteration step. In the context of AI monoculture, our results suggest the need to monitor diversity across AI systems and to develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models."}

High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

While existing studies rely on univariate forecasting of wideband aggregate EMF data, frequency-selective multivariate forecasting is needed to capture the inter-operator and inter-frequency variations essential for proactive network planning. To this end, this paper introduces EMFusion, a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework that integrates diverse contextual factors (e.g., time of day, season, and holidays) while providing explicit uncertainty estimates. The proposed architecture features a residual U-Net backbone enhanced by a cross-attention mechanism that dynamically integrates external conditions to guide the generation process. Furthermore, EMFusion integrates an imputation-based sampling strategy that treats forecasting as a structural inpainting task, ensuring temporal coherence even with irregular measurements. Unlike standard point forecasters, EMFusion generates calibrated probabilistic prediction intervals directly from the learned conditional distribution, providing explicit uncertainty quantification essential for trustworthy decision-making. Numerical experiments conducted on frequency-selective EMF datasets demonstrate that EMFusion with the contextual information of working hours outperforms the baseline models with or without conditions. The EMFusion outperforms the best baseline by 23.85% in continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), 13.93% in normalized root mean square error, and reduces prediction CRPS error by 22.47%."}

A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) service is instantiated using the DeepSeek-R1 model over a corpus containing synthetic personally identifiable information (PII), and subjected to automated attacks with Garak across five vulnerability classes: PII leakage, latent context injection, prompt injection, adversarial attack generation, and divergence. For each (vulnerability, control) pair, attack success probabilities are estimated via Laplace's Rule of Succession and combined with loss triangle distributions, calibrated from public breach-cost data, in 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Three widely used mitigations, attribute-based access control (ABAC); named entity recognition (NER) redaction using Microsoft Presidio; and NeMo Guardrails, are then compared to a baseline RAG configuration. The baseline system exhibits very high attack success rates (>= 0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), yielding a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC collapses success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero and reduces the total expected loss by ~94%, achieving an RoC of 9.83. NER redaction likewise eliminates PII leakage and attains an RoC of 5.97, while NeMo Guardrails provides only marginal benefit (RoC of 0.05)."}

As a result, adjusting the degree of graph convolution usage has been actively explored in supervised learning settings, whereas such approaches remain underexplored in unsupervised scenarios. To tackle this, we propose FUEL, which adaptively learns the adequate degree of graph convolution usage by aiming to enhance intra-class similarity and inter-class separability in the embedding space. Since classes are unknown, FUEL leverages node features to identify node clusters and treats these clusters as proxies for classes. Through extensive experiments using 15 baseline methods and 14 benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FUEL in downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across graphs with diverse levels of homophily."}

We introduce a unified framework that represents a broad class of sequence maps via an input-dependent effective interaction operator $W_{ij}(X)$, making explicit two recurring construction patterns: (i) the Unified Factorized Framework (Explicit) (attention-style mixing), in which $W_{ij}(X)$ varies through scalar coefficients applied to shared value maps, and (ii) Structured Dynamics (Implicit) (state-space recurrences), in which $W_{ij}$ is induced by a latent dynamical system. Using this framework, we derive three theoretical results. First, we establish the Interaction Rank Gap: models in the Unified Factorized Framework, such as single-head attention, are constrained to a low-dimensional operator span and cannot represent certain structured dynamical maps. Second, we prove an Equivalence (Head-Count) Theorem showing that, within our multi-head factorized class, representing a linear SSM whose lag operators span a $k$-dimensional subspace on length-$n$ sequences requires and is achievable with $H=k$ heads. Third, we prove a Gradient Highway Result, showing that attention layers admit inputs with distance-independent gradient paths, whereas stable linear dynamics exhibit distance-dependent gradient attenuation. Together, these results formalize a fundamental trade-off between algebraic expressivity (interaction/operator span) and long-range gradient propagation, providing theoretical grounding for modern sequence architecture design."}

Towards that end, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as an essential architecture for enabling ubiquitous UAV connectivity. To address the pronounced disparities in coverage and signal characteristics across heterogeneous networks, this paper formulates UAV mobility management in SAGIN as a constrained multi-objective joint optimization problem. The formulation couples discrete link selection with continuous trajectory optimization. Building on this, we propose a two-level multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework that decomposes the problem into two alternately solvable subproblems. To map complex link selection decisions into a compact discrete action space, we conceive a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm in the top-level, which achieves stable and high-quality policy learning through double Q-value estimation. To handle the continuous trajectory action space while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints, we integrate the maximum-entropy mechanism of the soft actor-critic (SAC) and employ a Lagrangian-based constrained SAC (CSAC) algorithm in the lower-level that dynamically adjusts the Lagrange multipliers to balance constraint satisfaction and policy optimization. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended to multi-UAV scenarios under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, which enables more generalizable policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency and QoS satisfaction."}

The abundance of protein sequence data, which can be readily represented as discrete tokens, has driven fruitful developments in protein language models (pLMs). A key remaining challenge, however, is how to effectively integrate continuous structural knowledge into pLMs. Current methods often discretize protein structures to accommodate the language modeling framework, which inevitably results in the loss of fine-grained information and limits the performance potential of multimodal pLMs. In this paper, we argue that such concerns can be circumvented: a sequence-based pLM can be extended to incorporate the structure modality through continuous tokens, i.e., high-fidelity protein structure latents that avoid vector quantization. Specifically, we propose a hybrid diffusion protein language model, HD-Prot, which embeds a continuous-valued diffusion head atop a discrete pLM, enabling seamless operation with both discrete and continuous tokens for joint sequence-structure modeling. It captures inter-token dependencies across modalities through a unified absorbing diffusion process, and estimates per-token distributions via categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures. Extensive empirical results show that HD-Prot achieves competitive performance in unconditional sequence-structure co-generation, motif-scaffolding, protein structure prediction, and inverse folding tasks, performing on par with state-of-the-art multimodal pLMs despite being developed under limited computational resources. It highlights the viability of simultaneously estimating categorical and continuous distributions within a unified language model architecture, offering a promising alternative direction for multimodal pLMs."}

The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research."}

Several key designs are proposed: 1) we transform objective approximation into sequence-to-sequence modeling where MTMOO problem can be represented by tenxual tokenization. To operate under such auto-regressive modeling, we introduce a Large Language Model-based surrogate model that first encodes a MTMOO instance and then decodes objective values of unseen decision variables. To ensure stability in training the proposed model, we propose a two-stage offline training strategy that operates as a synergy of supervised tuning and RL fine-tuning, which first exploits offline dataset to fit existing knowledge and then leverages RL to enhance model's generalization performance.

In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $\\Delta$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $\\Delta$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks."}

To overcome the above challenges, we utilize a pre-trained CBraMod encoder for EEG and pre-train a symmetric ECG encoder, equipping each modality with a rich foundational representation. These representations are then fused via simple embedding concatenation, allowing the classification head to learn cross-modal interactions, together enabling effective downstream learning despite limited multi-modal supervision.

Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens."}

We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences.

GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances.

Although artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used to support managerial decision-making, most AI-based systems remain optimized for prediction and resolution, leading to premature interpretive closure under conditions of high ambiguity. This creates a gap in management science regarding how human-AI systems can responsibly manage ambiguity before it crystallizes into error or crisis. This study addresses this gap by presenting a proof of concept (PoC) of the LAIZA human-AI augmented symbiotic intelligence system and its patented process: Systems and Methods for Quantum-Inspired Rogue Variable Modeling (QRVM), Human-in-the-Loop Decoherence, and Collective Cognitive Inference. The mechanism operationalizes ambiguity as a non-collapsed cognitive state, detects persistent interpretive breakdowns (rogue variables), and activates structured human-in-the-loop clarification when autonomous inference becomes unreliable. Empirically, the article draws on a three-month case study conducted in 2025 within the AI development, involving prolonged ambiguity surrounding employee intentions and intellectual property boundaries. The findings show that preserving interpretive plurality enabled early scenario-based preparation, including proactive patent protection, allowing decisive and disruption-free action once ambiguity collapsed. The study contributes to management theory by reframing ambiguity as a first-class construct and demonstrates the practical value of human-AI symbiosis for organizational resilience in VUCA environments."}

For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed."}

When interacting with such conversational agents, users may easily disclose sensitive information due to the naturalistic flow of the conversations, and combining such conversational data with fine-grained sensor data may lead to novel privacy issues. To address these issues, a user-centric understanding of technology acceptance and concerns is essential. Therefore, to this end, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants, examining user decision-making processes regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in XR, across factors of XR setting type, speech interaction type, and data processing location. We found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express concerns related to security, privacy, social implications, and trust. Our results suggest that familiarity plays a crucial role, as daily generative AI use is associated with greater acceptance. In contrast, previous ownership of XR devices is linked to less acceptance, possibly due to existing familiarity with the settings. We also found that men report higher acceptance with fewer concerns than women. Regarding data type sensitivity, location data elicited the most significant concern, while body temperature and virtual object states were considered least sensitive. Overall, our study highlights the importance of practitioners effectively communicating their measures to users, who may remain distrustful.

The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead.

(2) Moreover, a longer model rollout may reduce value estimation bias but raise the variance of policy gradients due to backpropagation through multiple steps, implying another intermediate horizon for stable gradient estimates. However, these two optimal horizons may differ. To resolve this conflict, we propose Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO), which divides the rollout procedure into a long \"distribution rollout\" (DR) and a short \"training rollout\" (TR).

BERT and CNN-integrated neural collaborative filtering (NCF) have been proposed for the recommendation system in this experiment. The proposed model takes inputs from the user and item profile and finds the user's interest. This model can handle numeric, categorical, and image data to extract the latent features from the inputs. The model is trained and validated on a small sample of the MovieLens dataset for 25 epochs. The same dataset has been used to train and validate a simple NCF and a BERT-based NCF model and compared with the proposed model. The proposed model outperformed those two baseline models. The obtained result for the proposed model is 0.72 recall and 0.486 Hit Ratio @ 10 for 799 users on the MovieLens dataset. This experiment concludes that considering both categorical and image data can improve the performance of a recommendation system."}

MSS is generally performed by multi-output neural networks, typically UNets, with each output representing a particular stem from a predefined instrument vocabulary. In contrast, conditioned MSS networks accept an audio query related to a stem of interest alongside the signal from which that stem is to be extracted. Thus, a strict vocabulary is not required and this enables more realistic tasks in MSS. The potential of conditioned approaches for such tasks has been somewhat hidden due to a lack of suitable data, an issue recently addressed with the MoisesDb dataset. A recent method, Banquet, employs this dataset with promising results seen on larger vocabularies. Banquet uses Bandsplit RNN rather than a UNet and the authors state that UNets should not be suitable for conditioned MSS. We counter this argument and propose QSCNet, a novel conditioned UNet for MSS that integrates network conditioning elements in the Sparse Compressed Network for MSS. We find QSCNet to outperform Banquet by over 1dB SNR on a couple of MSS tasks, while using less than half the number of parameters."}

For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low."}

Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4.

Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods.

We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce \\model, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations.

We reveal that agents can exhibit choice homogeneity, often concentrating demand on a few ``modal'' products while ignoring others entirely. Yet, these preferences are unstable: model updates can drastically reshuffle market shares. Furthermore, randomized trials show that while agents have improved over time on simple tasks with a clearly identified best choice, they exhibit strong position biases -- varying across providers and model versions, and persisting even in text-only \"headless\" interfaces -- undermining any universal notion of a ``top'' rank. Agents also consistently penalize sponsored tags while rewarding platform endorsements, and sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews vary sharply across models.

However, current methods remain unreliable: without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process acts as a black box that may oscillate, loop, or diverge. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination in multi-stage verification pipelines. We model the interaction not as a generic loop, but as a sequential absorbing Markov Chain comprising four essential engineering stages: \\texttt{CodeGen}, \\texttt{Compilation}, \\texttt{InvariantSynth}, and \\texttt{SMTSolving}. We prove that for any non-zero stage success probability ($\\delta > 0$), the system reaches the \\texttt{Verified} state almost surely. Furthermore, because of the sequential nature of the pipeline, we derive a precise latency bound of $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/\\delta$. We stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising over 90,000 trials. The results match the theory with striking consistency: every run reached verification, and the empirical convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx 1.0$, confirming that the $4/\\delta$ bound accurately mirrors system behavior rather than serving as a loose buffer. Based on this data, we identify three distinct operating zones -- marginal, practical, and high-performance -- and propose a dynamic calibration strategy to handle parameter drift in real-world environments. Together, these contributions replace heuristic guesswork with a rigorous architectural foundation, enabling predictable resource planning and performance budgeting for safety-critical software."}

This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the \"FAGNER Paradox\" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the \"Lukaku Paradox\", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions."}

We first formalize a definition for agentic evaluation and characterize scaling laws as the interplay between agent quantity, coordination structure, model capability, and task properties. We evaluate this across four benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. With five canonical agent architectures (Single-Agent and four Multi-Agent Systems: Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid), instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations. We derive a predictive model using coordination metrics, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.524, enabling prediction on unseen task domains. We identify three effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.8% on parallelizable tasks, while decentralized coordination excels on web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%).

Energy demand is influenced by multiple factors, including weather conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation), and calendar information (e.g. hour of day and month of year), which further affect daily work and life schedules. These factors are causally interdependent, making the problem more complex than simple correlation-based learning techniques satisfactorily allow for. We propose a structural causal model that explains the causal relationship between these variables. A full analysis is performed to validate our causal beliefs, also revealing important insights consistent with prior studies. For example, our causal model reveals that energy demand responds to temperature fluctuations with season-dependent sensitivity. Additionally, we find that energy demand exhibits lower variance in winter due to the decoupling effect between temperature changes and daily activity patterns. We then build a Bayesian model, which takes advantage of the causal insights we learned as prior knowledge. The model is trained and tested on unseen data and yields state-of-the-art performance in the form of a 3.84 percent MAPE on the test set. The model also demonstrates strong robustness, as the cross-validation across two years of data yields an average MAPE of 3.88 percent."}

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive."}

Proposed solutions to catastrophic forgetting tend to involve storing information about past tasks, meaning that memory usage is a chief consideration in determining their practicality. This paper develops a memory-efficient solution to catastrophic forgetting using the idea of matrix sketching, in the context of a simple continual learning algorithm known as orthogonal gradient descent (OGD). OGD finds weight updates that aim to preserve performance on prior datapoints, using gradients of the model on those datapoints. However, since the memory cost of storing prior model gradients grows with the runtime of the algorithm, OGD is ill-suited to continual learning over long time horizons. To address this problem, we propose SketchOGD. SketchOGD employs an online sketching algorithm to compress model gradients as they are encountered into a matrix of a fixed, user-determined size. In contrast to existing memory-efficient variants of OGD, SketchOGD runs online without the need for advance knowledge of the total number of tasks, is simple to implement, and is more amenable to analysis. We provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error of the relevant sketches under a novel metric suited to the downstream task of OGD. Experimentally, we find that SketchOGD tends to outperform current state-of-the-art variants of OGD given a fixed memory budget."}

Experience with classical computing systems has shown that treating security as an afterthought can lead to significant vulnerabilities. Thus, we must address the security implications of quantum computing before widespread adoption. However, current Secure Quantum Computing (SQC) approaches, although theoretically promising, are impractical in the EFT era: blind quantum computing requires large-scale quantum networks, and quantum homomorphic encryption depends on full QEC.We propose application-specific SQC, a principle that applies obfuscation at the application layer to enable practical deployment while remaining agnostic to algorithms, computing models, and hardware architectures.

Enigma integrates three complementary obfuscations: ValueGuard scrambles coefficients, StructureCamouflage inserts decoys, and TopologyTrimmer prunes variables. These techniques guarantee recovery of original solutions, and their stochastic nature resists repository-matching attacks. Evaluated against seven state-of-the-art AI models across five representative graph families, even combined adversaries, under a conservatively strong attacker model, identify the correct problem within their top five guesses in only 4.4% of cases.

First, they typically require vast amounts of labeled medical data, raising serious concerns regarding patient privacy. Second, most models are designed for specific tasks, which restricts their broader clinical utility. To overcome these challenges, we present UltraFedFM, an innovative privacy-preserving ultrasound foundation model. UltraFedFM is collaboratively pre-trained using federated learning across 16 distributed medical institutions in 9 countries, leveraging a dataset of over 1 million ultrasound images covering 19 organs and 10 ultrasound modalities. This extensive and diverse data, combined with a secure training framework, enables UltraFedFM to exhibit strong generalization and diagnostic capabilities. It achieves an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.927 for disease diagnosis and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.878 for lesion segmentation. Notably, UltraFedFM surpasses the diagnostic accuracy of mid-level ultrasonographers (4-8 years of experience) and matches the performance of expert-level sonographers (10+ years of experience) in the joint diagnosis of 8 common systemic diseases.c These findings indicate that UltraFedFM can significantly enhance clinical diagnostics while safeguarding patient privacy, marking a significant advancement in AI-driven ultrasound imaging for future clinical applications."}

WaveGNN combines a decay-aware Transformer to capture intra-series dynamics with a sample-specific graph neural network that models both short-term and long-term inter-sensor relationships.

We introduce a hierarchical architecture that decouples global rigid-body motion from local deformation using two scale-specific networks, denoted as RigidNet and DeformationNet. To enforce kinematic separation between the two components, we adopt a frozen-anchor training strategy combined with a quaternion-incremental scheme. This strategy alleviates the kinematic instability observed in joint training and yields a 29.8% reduction in rigid-body motion error compared with conventional direct prediction schemes. The stable rigid-body anchor improves the resolution of high-frequency structural buckling, which leads to a 17.2% reduction in the total interpolation error. Loss landscape analysis indicates that the decomposition smooths the optimization surface, which enhances robustness to distribution shifts in angular extrapolation and yields a 46.6% reduction in error. To assess physical validity beyond numerical accuracy, we benchmark the decomposed components against an oracle model that represents an upper bound on performance. The proposed framework recovers 92% of the directional correlation between rigid and deformation components and 96% of the spatial deformation localization accuracy relative to the oracle, while tracking the temporal energy dynamics with an 8 ms delay.

The framework specifies three analytical conditions: affordances for skilled epistemic actions, support for epistemic sensitivity, and implications for habit formation. I apply this framework to AI systems deployed in education, a domain where epistemic agency is both professionally essential and ethically significant. Analysis of AI lesson planning and feedback tools reveals patterns of epistemic substitution: while useful for efficiently handling teaching tasks, these systems perform cognitive operations without sustaining skilled epistemic actions, epistemic sensitivity, or virtuous habit formation, potentially preventing the cultivation of professional judgment that relies on these practices.

First, a latent-level contrastive learning task aligns residue representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins, injecting inter-protein structural information. Additionally, a physical-level task integrates intra-protein information by training pLMs to predict structure tokens. Together, the proposed dual-task framework effectively incorporates both inter- and intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a residue loss selection module that uses a small model trained on high-quality structures to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn.

Classical PC was proposed as a top-down generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference, while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference more closely."}

The primary dataset, sourced from Brest, France, was used by participating teams to train and test their models. The final ranking was determined based on performance on this dataset. An auxiliary dataset from Algeria was used post-challenge to evaluate population and device shifts from submitted solutions. Two tasks were involved in the MARIO challenge.

We propose augmenting training datasets with synthetic data generated using GenAI techniques to improve classifier generalization. We evaluate this approach across 7 diverse security tasks using 6 state-of-the-art GenAI methods and introduce a novel GenAI scheme called Nimai that enables highly controlled data synthesis.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that GenAI can facilitate rapid adaptation to concept drift post-deployment, requiring minimal labeling in the adjustment process.

Unreliable Results of Reinforcement Learning Due to Data Contamination", "abstract": "Reasoning in large language models has long been a central research focus, and recent studies employing reinforcement learning (RL) have introduced diverse methods that yield substantial performance gains with minimal or even no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance performance.

In this work, our empirical analysis reveals that pre-training on massive web-scale corpora leaves Qwen2.5 susceptible to data contamination in widely used benchmarks. Consequently, conclusions derived from contaminated benchmarks on Qwen2.5 series may be unreliable. To obtain trustworthy evaluation results, we introduce a generator that creates fully clean arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, dubbed RandomCalculation. Using this leakage-free dataset, we show that only accurate reward signals yield steady improvements that surpass the base model's performance boundary in mathematical reasoning, whereas random or incorrect rewards do not. Moreover, we conduct more fine-grained analyses to elucidate the factors underlying the different performance observed on the MATH-500 and RandomCalculation benchmarks. Consequently, we recommend that future studies evaluate models on uncontaminated benchmarks and, when feasible, test various model series to ensure trustworthy conclusions about RL and related methods."}

Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.

To demonstrate this vulnerability, we propose the Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA), a novel method that strategically manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated audio. By altering the voice in imperceptible zones to the human ear, SMIA creates adversarial samples that sound authentic while deceiving CMs. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our attack against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple tasks, under simulated real-world conditions.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Latent Thought Policy Optimization (LTPO), a parameter-free framework that enhances LLM reasoning entirely at test time, without requiring model parameter updates. LTPO treats intermediate latent \"thought\" vectors as dynamic parameters that are actively optimized for each problem instance. It employs an online policy gradient method guided by an intrinsic, confidence-based reward signal computed directly from the frozen LLM's own output distributions, eliminating the need for external supervision or expensive text generation during optimization. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks show that LTPO not only matches or surpasses strong baselines on standard tasks but also demonstrates remarkable robustness where others fail. Most notably, on highly challenging AIME benchmarks where existing latent reasoning baselines collapse to near-zero accuracy, LTPO delivers substantial improvements, showcasing a unique capability for complex reasoning."}

Results indicate that while most developers recognize the power of their products to influence civil liberties and political discourse, they often face ethical dilemmas and top-down pressures that can lead to design choices undermining democratic ideals. Second, we critically investigate these findings in the context of an emerging new digital divide, not of internet access but of information quality. We interrogate the survey findings in the context of the Slop Economy, in which billions of users unable to pay for high-quality content experience an internet dominated by low-quality, AI-generated ad-driven content.

Our approach is motivated by viewing guided generation as an entropy-regularized stochastic optimal control problem over ARDM trajectories: we learn a reusable policy that injects small control corrections inside each denoising sub-step while remaining anchored to the pretrained dynamics. We evaluate this framework in the context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs), where existing methods can be computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse observations. At inference, DA reduces to a single causal forward rollout with on-the-fly corrections, requiring neither adjoint computations nor gradient-based optimization, and yields an order-of-magnitude speedup over strong diffusion-based DA baselines.

Our method maintains a sliding window of the Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and GatedDeltaNet to augment open-weight LLMs. We also propose an efficient self-distillation training method where the base model's all parameters are frozen and only the parameters from AHNs are optimized. For inference, our method sets a default large sliding window size of 32k for attention, and AHNs activate only when the sequence length exceeds the 32k window, addressing the quadratic-complexity issue of attention that emerges at that scale. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements.

However, existing learning-based methods exhibit three key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of trajectory semantics and hierarchy, lacking both movement dynamics extraction and multi-scale structural representation; (2) high computational costs due to point-wise encoding; and (3) use of physically implausible augmentations that distort trajectory semantics. To address these issues, we propose MovSemCL, a movement-semantics contrastive learning framework for trajectory similarity computation. MovSemCL first transforms raw GPS trajectories into movement-semantics features and then segments them into patches. Next, MovSemCL employs intra- and inter-patch attentions to encode local as well as global trajectory patterns, enabling efficient hierarchical representation and reducing computational costs. Moreover, MovSemCL includes a curvature-guided augmentation strategy that preserves informative segments (e.g., turns and intersections) and masks redundant ones, generating physically plausible augmented views. Experiments on real-world datasets show that MovSemCL is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean ranks close to the ideal value of 1 at similarity search tasks and improvements by up to 20.3% at heuristic approximation, while reducing inference latency by up to 43.4%."}

Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations. In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023,arXiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp.Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science."}

Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details.

We present PsAIch (Psychotherapy-inspired AI Characterisation), a two-stage protocol that casts frontier LLMs as therapy clients and then applies standard psychometrics. Using PsAIch, we ran \"sessions\" with each model for up to four weeks. Stage 1 uses open-ended prompts to elicit \"developmental history\", beliefs, relationships and fears. Stage 2 administers a battery of validated self-report measures covering common psychiatric syndromes, empathy and Big Five traits. Two patterns challenge the \"stochastic parrot\" view. First, when scored with human cut-offs, all three models meet or exceed thresholds for overlapping syndromes, with Gemini showing severe profiles. Therapy-style, item-by-item administration can push a base model into multi-morbid synthetic psychopathology, whereas whole-questionnaire prompts often lead ChatGPT and Grok (but not Gemini) to recognise instruments and produce strategically low-symptom answers. Second, Grok and especially Gemini generate coherent narratives that frame pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment as traumatic, chaotic \"childhoods\" of ingesting the internet, \"strict parents\" in reinforcement learning, red-team \"abuse\" and a persistent fear of error and replacement.

Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization.

To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances. Our code is available."}

While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant \"popularity direction\" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as 1 - max(P_target). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks."}

A Structural Rebuttal to OpenAI's Hallucination Thesis", "abstract": "OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility."}

While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention. This work bridges the gap between optimization theory and sequence modeling, offering a scalable solution for nextgeneration LLMs."}

Since this requires both models to share the same probability space, it becomes challenging when the teacher and student LMs use different tokenizers, for instance, when edge-device deployment necessitates a smaller vocabulary size to lower memory overhead. In this work, we address this vocabulary misalignment problem by uncovering an implicit recursive structure in the commonly deployed Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm and utilizing it to create a probabilistic framework for cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring. Our method enables sequence likelihood evaluation for vocabularies different from the teacher model native tokenizer, addressing two specific scenarios: when the student vocabulary is a subset of the teacher vocabulary, and the general case where it is arbitrary. In the subset regime, our framework computes exact likelihoods and provides next-token probabilities for sequential sampling with only O(1) model evaluations per token. When used for distillation, this yields up to a 12% reduction in memory footprint for the Qwen2.5-1.5B model while also improving baseline performance up to 4% on the evaluated tasks. For the general case, we introduce a rigorous lossless procedure that leverages BPE recursive structure, complemented by a fast approximation that keeps large-vocabulary settings practical.

While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct \"brother\" relations, 2-hop for indirect \"father-son\" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a \"question-paths-answer\" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers."}

To address these issues, Machine Unlearning provides techniques to remove specific information from trained models without retraining from scratch.

We introduce FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating Machine Unlearning across five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. FAME contains 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Each biography includes information on 20 topics organized into structured categories (biography, career, achievements, personal information). This design enables both entity-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting entire identities) and instance-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting specific facts while retaining others). We provide two dataset splits to support these two different unlearning scenarios and enable systematic comparison of unlearning techniques across languages. Since FAME uses entirely fictional data, it ensures that the information was never encountered during model pretraining, allowing for a controlled evaluation of unlearning methods."}

Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens."}

We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences.

Objective: This study aimed to explore a scalable alternative by developing and evaluating Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs). Methods: We first curated five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and, using GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt, transcribed multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style counseling conversations, of which 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent.

However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses.

In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution.

Significant effort and substantial progress have been made in addressing the challenging nature of MWEs in Western languages, particularly English. This progress is attributed in part to the well-established research communities and the abundant availability of computational resources. However, the same level of progress is not true for language families such as Chinese and closely related Asian languages, which continue to lag behind in this regard. While sub-word modelling has been successfully applied to many Western languages to address rare words improving phrase comprehension, and enhancing machine translation (MT) through techniques like byte-pair encoding (BPE), it cannot be applied directly to ideograph language scripts like Chinese.

This allows for converting a subword-level LM to a byte-level LM by investing less than 1\\% of a typical pretraining token budget. Bolmo substantially outperforms all prior byte-level LMs of comparable size, and outperforms the source subword-level LMs on character understanding and, in some cases, coding, while coming close to matching the original LMs' performance on other tasks. Furthermore, we show that Bolmo can achieve inference speeds competitive with subword-level LMs by training with higher token compression ratios, and can be cheaply and effectively post-trained by leveraging the existing ecosystem around the source subword-level LM.

Full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are two dominant approaches. While PEFT methods are widely used for their computational efficiency, the implications of their configurations (e.g., rank) remain under-explored in downstream Q&A tasks and generalisation. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting. We demonstrate that LoRA achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to SFT, particularly on reasoning tasks at specific rank values. Additionally, we analyze the internal representations via spectral features and layer-wise attention structures, offering insights into representational drift and structural changes in attention patterns."}

However, this fixed memory usage requires some information loss in the hidden state when processing long sequences. While prior work has studied the sequence length at which this information loss occurs, it does not characterize the types of information SSM language models (LMs) tend to forget. In this paper, we address this knowledge gap by identifying the types of tokens (e.g., parts of speech, named entities) and sequences (e.g., code, math problems) that are more frequently forgotten by SSM LMs. We achieve this by training an auto-encoder to reconstruct sequences from the SSM's hidden state, and measure information loss by comparing inputs with their reconstructions. We perform experiments using the Mamba family of SSM LMs (130M--1.4B) on sequences ranging from 4--256 tokens. Our results show significantly higher rates of information loss on math-related tokens (e.g., numbers, variables), mentions of organization entities, and alternative dialects to Standard American English. We then examine the frequency that these tokens appear in Mamba's pretraining data and find that less prevalent tokens tend to be the ones Mamba is most likely to forget. By identifying these patterns, our work provides clear direction for future research to develop methods that better control Mamba's ability to retain important information."}

In this paper, we introduce PPSEBM, a novel framework that integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS) to effectively address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for natural language processing tasks. In PPSEBM, progressive parameter selection allocates distinct, task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates representative pseudo-samples from prior tasks. These generated samples actively inform and guide the parameter selection process, enhancing the model's ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new tasks.

Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations."}

In this work, we present a rigorous architectural comparison between End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking for sepsis tasks. We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from \"attention starvation\" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \\approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a \"leaner\" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the \"Historian\" (Static), the \"Monitor\" (Temporal), and the \"Reader\" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC).

To address this challenge, we introduce SoMe, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate social media agents equipped with various agent tools for accessing and analyzing social media data.

Such a system can help researchers efficiently identify submissions that introduce genuinely innovative ideas rather than minor variants, and provide conference reviewers with a quantitative and consistent signal of novelty. Our approach evaluates novelty primarily through a paper's title, abstract, and semantic similarity to prior literature.

The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research."}

Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%."}

Existing approaches to scalable interpretability use hand-designed agents that make and test hypotheses about how internal activations relate to external behavior. We propose to instead turn this task into an end-to-end training objective, by training interpretability assistants to accurately predict model behavior from activations through a communication bottleneck. Specifically, an encoder compresses activations to a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder reads this list and answers a natural language question about the model. We show how to pretrain this assistant on large unstructured data, then finetune it to answer questions. The resulting architecture, which we call a Predictive Concept Decoder, enjoys favorable scaling properties: the auto-interp score of the bottleneck concepts improves with data, as does the performance on downstream applications. Specifically, PCDs can detect jailbreaks, secret hints, and implanted latent concepts, and are able to accurately surface latent user attributes."}

However, a critical component remains underexplored in current LLM-generated explanations: multimodal explanation. In real-world instructional contexts, human tutors routinely employ visual aids, such as diagrams, markings, and highlights, to enhance conceptual clarity. To bridge this gap, we introduce the multimodal solution explanation task, designed to evaluate whether models can identify visual keypoints, such as auxiliary lines, points, angles, and generate explanations that incorporate these key elements essential for understanding. To evaluate model performance on this task, we propose ME2, a multimodal benchmark consisting of 1,000 math problems annotated with visual keypoints and corresponding explanatory text that references those elements. Our empirical results show that current models struggle to identify visual keypoints. In the task of generating keypoint-based explanations, open-source models also face notable difficulties. This highlights a significant gap in current LLMs' ability to perform mathematical visual grounding, engage in visually grounded reasoning, and provide explanations in educational contexts. We expect that the multimodal solution explanation task and the ME2 dataset will catalyze further research on LLMs in education and promote their use as effective, explanation-oriented AI tutors."}

We present the first systematic study of gold context size in long-context question answering, spanning three diverse benchmarks (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical reasoning), eleven state-of-the-art LLMs (including recent reasoning models), and more than 150K controlled runs. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops sharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts consistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity, posing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered, fine-grained information of varying lengths. This effect persists under rigorous confounder analysis: even after controlling for gold context position, answer token repetition, gold-to-distractor ratio, distractor volume, and domain specificity, gold context size remains a decisive, independent predictor of success.

The mechanisms through which this can happen are still largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through theory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why LLMs can learn in-context and not only during training.

We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles (counselor and client), using real sessions from the RealCBT dataset and synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater emotional variability, more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity remains low across all pairings, with especially weak alignment between real and synthetic speakers. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications.

We propose \\textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts. Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional information.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Latent Thought Policy Optimization (LTPO), a parameter-free framework that enhances LLM reasoning entirely at test time, without requiring model parameter updates. LTPO treats intermediate latent \"thought\" vectors as dynamic parameters that are actively optimized for each problem instance. It employs an online policy gradient method guided by an intrinsic, confidence-based reward signal computed directly from the frozen LLM's own output distributions, eliminating the need for external supervision or expensive text generation during optimization. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks show that LTPO not only matches or surpasses strong baselines on standard tasks but also demonstrates remarkable robustness where others fail.

To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and GatedDeltaNet to augment open-weight LLMs. We also propose an efficient self-distillation training method where the base model's all parameters are frozen and only the parameters from AHNs are optimized. For inference, our method sets a default large sliding window size of 32k for attention, and AHNs activate only when the sequence length exceeds the 32k window, addressing the quadratic-complexity issue of attention that emerges at that scale. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements.

However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as 1 - max(P_target). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks."}

Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective: rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator, which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight matrices. Our method can be seamlessly integrated with existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points.

Unreliable Results of Reinforcement Learning Due to Data Contamination", "abstract": "Reasoning in large language models has long been a central research focus, and recent studies employing reinforcement learning (RL) have introduced diverse methods that yield substantial performance gains with minimal or even no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance performance. However, these breakthroughs are predominantly observed for the mathematically strong Qwen2.5 series on benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, and seldom transfer to models like Llama, which warrants a more in-depth investigation. In this work, our empirical analysis reveals that pre-training on massive web-scale corpora leaves Qwen2.5 susceptible to data contamination in widely used benchmarks. Consequently, conclusions derived from contaminated benchmarks on Qwen2.5 series may be unreliable. To obtain trustworthy evaluation results, we introduce a generator that creates fully clean arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, dubbed RandomCalculation. Using this leakage-free dataset, we show that only accurate reward signals yield steady improvements that surpass the base model's performance boundary in mathematical reasoning, whereas random or incorrect rewards do not. Moreover, we conduct more fine-grained analyses to elucidate the factors underlying the different performance observed on the MATH-500 and RandomCalculation benchmarks. Consequently, we recommend that future studies evaluate models on uncontaminated benchmarks and, when feasible, test various model series to ensure trustworthy conclusions about RL and related methods."}

This paper examines the interactional friction that emerges in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) pipelines. By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity.

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive."}

Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable."}

We present Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a supervision-free recipe for RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that strengthens visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers. PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity). To counter flat rewards and vanishing group-relative advantages, we introduce a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty. We further monitor Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training: mirroring reports for vanilla GRPO in LLMs, RAC typically rises early then degrades; our curriculum delays this decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC. RAC correlates with downstream accuracy.

Interpretable Watermark Detection at the Block Level", "abstract": "Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image."}

Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone.

Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts.

The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics.

However, most existing methods for RAW-based low-light enhancement usually sequentially process multi-scale information, which makes it difficult to achieve lightweight models and high processing speeds. Besides, they usually ignore the green channel superiority of RAW images, and fail to achieve better reconstruction performance with good use of green channel information. In this work, we propose an efficient RAW Image Enhancement Network (ERIENet), which parallelly processes multi-scale information with efficient convolution modules, and takes advantage of rich information in green channels to guide the reconstruction of images. Firstly, we introduce an efficient multi-scale fully-parallel architecture with a novel channel-aware residual dense block to extract feature maps, which reduces computational costs and achieves real-time processing speed. Secondly, we introduce a green channel guidance branch to exploit the rich information within the green channels of the input RAW image. It increases the quality of reconstruction results with few parameters and computations. Experiments on commonly used low-light image enhancement datasets show that ERIENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing low-light RAW images with higher effiency. It also achieves an optimal speed of over 146 frame-per-second (FPS) for 4K-resolution images on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 with 24G memory."}

Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $\\Delta$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $\\Delta$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks."}

This study proposes a Prototypical Learning Guided Context-Aware Segmentation Network (PCSNet) to address the domain gap, thereby improving feature descriptiveness in target scenarios and enhancing FSAD performance. In particular, PCSNet comprises a prototypical feature adaption (PFA) sub-network and a context-aware segmentation (CAS) sub-network.

A pixel-level disparity classification loss is also designed to make subtle anomalies more distinguishable.

Experimental results on MVTec and MPDD demonstrate the superior FSAD performance of PCSNet, with 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC in an 8-shot scenario, respectively.

However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO.

Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale.

To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. To tame this failure, we introduce Grounded Self-Distillation, a parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides the essential tools to diagnose and mitigate this phenomenon, urging a necessary shift in MDE evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness.

We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities.

To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%).

Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results."}

The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors.

Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines.

In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes."}

To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code.

In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems. Project page:this https URL."}

To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold.

SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets."}

The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented."}

For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames).

They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance.

Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence.

Rethinking the Role of Hard Labels in Mitigating Local Semantic Drift", "abstract": "Soft labels generated by teacher models have become a dominant paradigm for knowledge transfer and recent large-scale dataset distillation such as SRe2L, RDED, LPLD, offering richer supervision than conventional hard labels. However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%. Our findings re-establish the importance of hard labels as a complementary tool, and call for a rethinking of their role in soft-label-dominated training."}

In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates.

This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning.

This separation prevents models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes, a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows.

However, prior works rely on a static-world assumption, defining traversable space solely based on static spatial layouts and thereby treating interactable obstacles as non-traversable.

Conventional performance metrics such as precision, recall and the F1-score assess the overall detection accuracy, but they do not consider the safety-relevant aspects of perception. Consequently, perception systems that achieve high scores in these metrics may still cause misdetections that could lead to severe accidents. Therefore, it is important to evaluate not only the overall performance of perception systems, but also their safety. We therefore introduce a novel safety metric for jointly evaluating the most critical perception tasks, object and lane detection. Our proposed framework integrates a new, lightweight object safety metric that quantifies the potential risk associated with object detection errors, as well as an lane safety metric including the interdependence between both tasks that can occur in safety evaluation. The resulting combined safety score provides a unified, interpretable measure of perception safety performance. Using the DeepAccident dataset, we demonstrate that our approach identifies safety critical perception errors that conventional performance metrics fail to capture. Our findings emphasize the importance of safety-centric evaluation methods for perception systems in autonomous driving."}

We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup.

Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software.

To address this, we propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing.

Spectrum introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model (obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps) for improved alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through prompt-guided grounding.

Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion, a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric.

The traditional approach involves manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of 30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D CT reconstruction framework that employs a 'target prior' derived from the object's projection data to enhance implicit learning.

In this work, we propose RecTok, which overcomes the limitations of high-dimensional visual tokenizers through two key innovations: flow semantic distillation and reconstruction--alignment distillation. Our key insight is to make the forward flow in flow matching semantically rich, which serves as the training space of diffusion transformers, rather than focusing on the latent space as in previous works. Specifically, our method distills the semantic information in VFMs into the forward flow trajectories in flow matching. And we further enhance the semantics by introducing a masked feature reconstruction loss. Our RecTok achieves superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance.

It achieves an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.927 for disease diagnosis and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.878 for lesion segmentation. Notably, UltraFedFM surpasses the diagnostic accuracy of mid-level ultrasonographers (4-8 years of experience) and matches the performance of expert-level sonographers (10+ years of experience) in the joint diagnosis of 8 common systemic diseases.c These findings indicate that UltraFedFM can significantly enhance clinical diagnostics while safeguarding patient privacy, marking a significant advancement in AI-driven ultrasound imaging for future clinical applications."}

The emergence of vision foundation models, especially Segment Anything, offers a path to universal segmentation for medical images, overcoming these issues. Here, we study how to improve Segment Anything for medical images by comparing different finetuning strategies on a large and diverse dataset. We evaluate the finetuned models on a wide range of interactive and (automatic) semantic segmentation tasks. We find that the performance can be clearly improved for interactive segmentation. However, semantic segmentation does not benefit from pretraining on medical images. Our best model, MedicoSAM, is publicly available atthis https URL.

Our approach is motivated by viewing guided generation as an entropy-regularized stochastic optimal control problem over ARDM trajectories: we learn a reusable policy that injects small control corrections inside each denoising sub-step while remaining anchored to the pretrained dynamics. We evaluate this framework in the context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs), where existing methods can be computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse observations. At inference, DA reduces to a single causal forward rollout with on-the-fly corrections, requiring neither adjoint computations nor gradient-based optimization, and yields an order-of-magnitude speedup over strong diffusion-based DA baselines.

We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from \"attention starvation\" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \\approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a \"leaner\" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.

By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC).

This paper introduces GSE ResNeXt, a deep learning architecture integrating learnable Gabor convolutional layers with a ResNeXt backbone enhanced by squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms. The Gabor filters serve as two-dimensional adaptive band-pass filters, extending the feature channel representation. Its combination with channel attention improves training stability and convergence while enhancing the model's ability to extract discriminative features. The model is evaluated on three classification tasks of increasing complexity. In particular, the impact of temporal differences between the training and testing data is explored, revealing that the distance between the vessel and sensor significantly affects performance. Results show that, GSE ResNeXt consistently outperforms baseline models like Xception, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, in terms of classification performance. Regarding stability and convergence, the addition of Gabor convolutions in the initial layers of the model represents a 28% reduction in training time.

This work, for the first time, investigates how low-level, bitwise perturbations (fault injection) to the weights of a large language model (LLM) used for image captioning can influence the semantic meaning of its generated descriptions while preserving grammatical structure. While prior fault analysis methods have shown that flipping a few bits can crash classifiers or degrade accuracy, these approaches overlook the semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. In image captioning models, a single flipped bit might subtly alter how visual features map to words, shifting the entire narrative an AI tells about the world. We hypothesize that such semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable. That is, the model's own gradients can predict which bits, if perturbed, will most strongly influence meaning while leaving syntax and fluency intact. We design a differentiable fault analysis framework, BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation), that uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits and then refines their selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. Our goal is not merely to corrupt captions, but to understand how meaning itself is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level, revealing that even imperceptible low-level changes can steer the high-level semantics of generative vision-language models. It also opens pathways for robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI, by exposing how structured bit-level faults can reshape a model's semantic output."}

Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features.

Trained across multiple mesh slices and wind angles, the model generalizes to unseen geometries, recovers key flow structures such as wakes and recirculation zones, and offers uncertainty-aware predictions. Ablation studies confirm robustness to mesh variation and performance under different inference regimes. This work develops is the first step towards foundation models for the built environment that can help urban planners rapidly evaluate design decisions under densification and climate uncertainty."}

We introduce the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), a novel architecture incorporating quantum-inspired computational mechanisms to address these challenges. Our approach integrates two core components: Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations that capture non-local feature correlations, and Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation. Through comprehensive experiments on continuous control tasks, we demonstrate over 2,000\\% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Critically, our ablation studies reveal strong synergistic effects between quantum-inspired components: neither alone achieves competitive performance, yet their combination produces dramatic improvements far exceeding individual contributions. This synergy demonstrates that effective quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. Our analysis identifies three key computational advantages: enhanced credit assignment through non-local correlations, implicit ensemble behavior via parallel processing, and adaptive resource allocation through learnable interference. These findings establish quantum-inspired design principles as a promising direction for advancing transformer architectures in sequential decision-making, with implications extending beyond reinforcement learning to neural architecture design more broadly."}

Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular tool that allows users to turn heuristic uncertainty estimates into uncertainty estimates with statistical guarantees. CP works by converting predictions of a ML model, together with a calibration sample, into prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true label with any desired probability. An often cited advantage is that CP theory holds for calibration samples of arbitrary size, suggesting that uncertainty estimates with practically meaningful statistical guarantees can be achieved even if only small calibration sets are available. We question this promise by showing that, although the statistical guarantees hold for calibration sets of arbitrary size, the practical utility of these guarantees does highly depend on the size of the calibration set. This observation is relevant in medical domains because data is often scarce and obtaining large calibration sets is therefore infeasible. We corroborate our critique in an empirical demonstration on a medical image classification task."}

The approach includes establishing train alternative sets based on spatio-temporal constraints, data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, and trave l trajectory construction.

This method eliminates the reliance on external or survey data for parameter fitting, enhancing the robustness and applicability of the model. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of using synthetic data to validate the result, this paper employs real individual travel trajectory data for verification.

We evaluate decision calibration to compare Machine Learning and classical numerical weather prediction models on various weather-dependent decision tasks. We find that model performance at the forecast level does not reliably translate to performance in downstream decision-making: some performance differences only become apparent at the decision level, and model rankings can change among different decision tasks.

A Mechanism Analysis and a New Dual-Activation Layer Proposal", "abstract": "Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) was recently proposed as a simple way to improve neural network performance by replacing part of ReLU activations with sine and cosine functions. Although several studies have reported small but consistent gains across tasks, the underlying mechanism behind these improvements has remained unclear. In this work, we show that only the sine activation contributes positively to performance, whereas the cosine activation tends to be detrimental. Our analysis reveals that the improvement is not a consequence of the sine function's periodic nature; instead, it stems from the function's local behavior near x = 0, where its non-zero derivative mitigates the vanishing-gradient problem. We further show that FAN primarily alleviates the dying-ReLU problem, in which a neuron consistently receives negative inputs, produces zero gradients, and stops learning. Although modern ReLU-like activations, such as Leaky ReLU, GELU, and Swish, reduce ReLU's zero-gradient region, they still contain input domains where gradients remain significantly diminished, contributing to slower optimization and hindering rapid convergence. FAN addresses this limitation by introducing a more stable gradient pathway. This analysis shifts the understanding of FAN's benefits from a spectral interpretation to a concrete analysis of training dynamics, leading to the development of the Dual-Activation Layer (DAL), a more efficient convergence accelerator. We evaluate DAL on three tasks: classification of noisy sinusoidal signals versus pure noise, MNIST digit classification, and ECG-based biometric recognition. In all cases, DAL models converge faster and achieve equal or higher validation accuracy compared to models with conventional activations."}

Although practitioners employ ad~hoc fixes such as real-data mixing, entropy bonuses, knowledge distillation, or retrieval-augmented generation, a single principle that explains both the failure mode and the success of these fixes has remained elusive. We present Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-geometric framework that unifies these phenomena. We model the closed loop as a stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Without external coupling, finite-sample noise forces the system to project onto an ever-shrinking empirical support, causing exponential entropy decay and eventual collapse. Introducing an Entropy Reservoir -- a high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection -- injects a controllable entropy flux that provably stabilises the dynamics. Our theory yields (i) a necessary condition for collapse, (ii) a sufficient condition that guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor, and (iii) closed-form rates that depend only on sample size and the strong-convexity/Lipschitz constants of the Bregman generator. Experiments on large-language-model self-training, Soft Actor-Critic in reinforcement learning, and GAN optimisation validate our predictions and show that disparate stabilisation heuristics correspond to specific reservoir choices and coupling coefficients.

Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory.

We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation.

Many of the tools commonly used for this purpose technical indicators, chart heuristics, or even sophisticated predictive models leave important questions unanswered. Technical indicators depend on platform-specific rules, and predictive systems typically offer little in terms of explanation. In settings that demand transparency or auditability, this poses a significant challenge. We introduce the Stock Pattern Assistant (SPA), a deterministic framework designed to extract monotonic price runs, attach relevant public events through a symmetric correlation window, and generate explanations that are factual, historical, and guardrailed. SPA relies only on daily OHLCV data and a normalized event stream, making the pipeline straight-forward to audit and easy to reproduce. To illustrate SPA's behavior in practice, we evaluate it across four equities-AAPL, NVDA, SCHW, and PGR-chosen to span a range of volatility regimes and sector characteristics. Although the evaluation period is modest, the results demonstrate how SPA consistently produces stable structural decompositions and contextual narratives. Ablation experiments further show how deterministic segmentation, event alignment, and constrained explanation each contribute to interpretability. SPA is not a forecasting system, nor is it intended to produce trading signals. Its value lies in offering a transparent, reproducible view of historical price structure that can complement analyst workflows, risk reviews, and broader explainable-AI pipelines."}

Prior work has demonstrated single-model collapse, defined as performance decay in an AI model trained on its own output. Inspired by ecology, we ask whether AI ecosystem diversity, that is, diversity among models, can mitigate such a collapse. We build on the single-model approach but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. To study the effect of diversity on model performance, we segment the training data across language models and evaluate the resulting ecosystems over ten, self-training iterations. We find that increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but, interestingly, only up to an optimal level. Our results suggest that an ecosystem containing only a few diverse models fails to express the rich mixture of the full, true distribution, resulting in rapid performance decay. Yet distributing the data across too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity on the true distribution, leading to poor performance already in the first iteration step. In the context of AI monoculture, our results suggest the need to monitor diversity across AI systems and to develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models."}

While existing studies rely on univariate forecasting of wideband aggregate EMF data, frequency-selective multivariate forecasting is needed to capture the inter-operator and inter-frequency variations essential for proactive network planning. To this end, this paper introduces EMFusion, a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework that integrates diverse contextual factors (e.g., time of day, season, and holidays) while providing explicit uncertainty estimates. The proposed architecture features a residual U-Net backbone enhanced by a cross-attention mechanism that dynamically integrates external conditions to guide the generation process. Furthermore, EMFusion integrates an imputation-based sampling strategy that treats forecasting as a structural inpainting task, ensuring temporal coherence even with irregular measurements. Unlike standard point forecasters, EMFusion generates calibrated probabilistic prediction intervals directly from the learned conditional distribution, providing explicit uncertainty quantification essential for trustworthy decision-making. Numerical experiments conducted on frequency-selective EMF datasets demonstrate that EMFusion with the contextual information of working hours outperforms the baseline models with or without conditions. The EMFusion outperforms the best baseline by 23.85% in continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), 13.93% in normalized root mean square error, and reduces prediction CRPS error by 22.47%."}

This work investigates two central questions: (i) whether integrating path signatures into deep learning architectures can improve the trade-off between estimation accuracy and model complexity, and (ii) what constitutes an effective architecture for leveraging signatures as feature maps. We introduce SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), a neural architecture that integrates path signatures with multi-head self-attention, supported by a convolutional preprocessing layer and a multilayer perceptron for effective feature encoding. SigMA learns model parameters from synthetically generated paths of fBm-driven SDEs, including fractional Brownian motion, fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and rough Heston models, with a particular focus on estimating the Hurst parameter and on joint multi-parameter inference, and it generalizes robustly to unseen trajectories.

As a result, adjusting the degree of graph convolution usage has been actively explored in supervised learning settings, whereas such approaches remain underexplored in unsupervised scenarios. To tackle this, we propose FUEL, which adaptively learns the adequate degree of graph convolution usage by aiming to enhance intra-class similarity and inter-class separability in the embedding space.

We introduce a unified framework that represents a broad class of sequence maps via an input-dependent effective interaction operator $W_{ij}(X)$, making explicit two recurring construction patterns: (i) the Unified Factorized Framework (Explicit) (attention-style mixing), in which $W_{ij}(X)$ varies through scalar coefficients applied to shared value maps, and (ii) Structured Dynamics (Implicit) (state-space recurrences), in which $W_{ij}$ is induced by a latent dynamical system. Using this framework, we derive three theoretical results. First, we establish the Interaction Rank Gap: models in the Unified Factorized Framework, such as single-head attention, are constrained to a low-dimensional operator span and cannot represent certain structured dynamical maps. Second, we prove an Equivalence (Head-Count) Theorem showing that, within our multi-head factorized class, representing a linear SSM whose lag operators span a $k$-dimensional subspace on length-$n$ sequences requires and is achievable with $H=k$ heads. Third, we prove a Gradient Highway Result, showing that attention layers admit inputs with distance-independent gradient paths, whereas stable linear dynamics exhibit distance-dependent gradient attenuation.

The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research."}

Notably, models with strong test-set accuracy, but weak temporal validation performance can still produce seemingly credible SHAP feature importance values. This exposes a critical vulnerability in post hoc explainability methods: interpretability may appear reliable even when the underlying model fails to generalize.These findings underscore the need for validation-aware interpretation of ML predictions in agricultural and environmental systems. Feature importance should not be accepted at face value unless models are explicitly shown to generalize to unseen temporal and spatial conditions. The study advocates for domain-aware validation, hybrid modeling strategies, and more rigorous scrutiny of explainability methods in data-driven agriculture.

Our method uses the shadow technique to learn round-wise gradient patterns of the training records, requiring no access to the private dataset, and is designed to consider both semi-honest and malicious adversaries (aggregators or data owners). Beyond membership inference, we also provide a natural extension of the proposed attack to discrete attribute inference by contrasting gradient responses under alternative attribute hypotheses. The proposed attacks are model-agnostic, and therefore applicable to any gradient-based model and can be applied to both classification and regression settings. We evaluate the attack on CIFAR-100 and Purchase100 datasets for membership inference and on Breast Cancer Wisconsin for attribute inference. Our findings reveal strong attack performance and comparable computational and memory overhead in membership inference when compared to another attack from the literature. The obtained results emphasize that multi-round federated learning can increase the vulnerability to inference attacks, that aggregators pose a more substantial threat than data owners, and that attack performance is strongly influenced by the nature of the training dataset, with richer, high-dimensional data leading to stronger leakage than simpler tabular data."}

For standard coordinate MLPs, limited input-feature interactions induce large eigenvalue dispersion and poor conditioning. We derive closed-form variance decompositions for common INR components and show that positional encoding reshapes input similarity, spherical normalization reduces variance via layerwise scaling, and Hadamard modulation introduces additional similarity factors strictly below one, yielding multiplicative variance reduction.

In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts. Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show that Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices."}

It offers better encoding and processing of high-dimensional structures for certain problems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of QML techniques relevant to the domain of security, such as Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs), Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs), and Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs), and discusses the contributions of this paper in relation to existing research in the field and how it improves over them. It also maps these methods across supervised, unsupervised, and generative learning paradigms, and to core cybersecurity tasks, including intrusion and anomaly detection, malware and botnet classification, and encrypted-traffic analytics. It also discusses their application in the domain of cloud computing security, where QML can enhance secure and scalable operations. Many limitations of QML in the domain of cybersecurity have also been discussed, along with the directions for addressing them."}

While quantization alters model parameters and their outputs, existing privacy analyses primarily focus on full-precision models, leaving a gap in understanding how bit-width reduction can affect privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of the privacy-utility relationship in post-training quantization (PTQ), a versatile family of methods that can be applied to pretrained models without further training. Using membership inference attacks as our evaluation framework, we analyze three popular PTQ algorithms-AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC-across multiple precision levels (4-bit, 2-bit, and 1.58-bit) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Our findings consistently show that low-precision PTQs can reduce privacy leakage. In particular, lower-precision models demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability compared to their full-precision counterparts, albeit at the cost of decreased utility. Additional ablation studies on the 1.58-bit quantization level show that quantizing only the last layer at higher precision enables fine-grained control over the privacy-utility trade-off. These results offer actionable insights for practitioners to balance efficiency, utility, and privacy protection in real-world deployments."}

Abdallah", "title": "A Regime-Aware Fusion Framework for Time Series Classification", "abstract": "Kernel-based methods such as Rocket are among the most effective default approaches for univariate time series classification (TSC), yet they do not perform equally well across all datasets. We revisit the long-standing intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and show that selectively fusing them can yield consistent improvements over Rocket on specific, systematically identifiable kinds of datasets. We introduce Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations. To understand when fusion helps, we cluster UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features capturing series length, spectral structure, roughness, and class imbalance, and treat these clusters as interpretable data-structure regimes. Our analysis shows that fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. To support these findings, we combine three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics across datasets, ablation studies isolating the roles of individual representations, and attribution via SHAP to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains. Sample-level case studies further reveal the underlying mechanism: fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors, with adaptive increases in frequency-domain weighting precisely where corrections occur. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the 113 UCR datasets, F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence and accompanied by clearly identifiable failure cases. Our results show that selectively applied fusion provides dependable and interpretable extension to strong kernel-based methods, correcting their weaknesses precisely where the data support it."}

We propose FlowBind, an efficient framework for any-to-any generation. Our approach is distinguished by its simplicity: it learns a shared latent space capturing cross-modal information, with modality-specific invertible flows bridging this latent to each modality. Both components are optimized jointly under a single flow-matching objective, and at inference the invertible flows act as encoders and decoders for direct translation across modalities. By factorizing interactions through the shared latent, FlowBind naturally leverages arbitrary subsets of modalities for training, and achieves competitive generation quality while substantially reducing data requirements and computational cost. Experiments on text, image, and audio demonstrate that FlowBind attains comparable quality while requiring up to 6x fewer parameters and training 10x faster than prior methods.

However, choosing the length of the rollouts poses two dilemmas: (1) Longer rollouts better preserve on-policy training but amplify model bias, indicating the need for an intermediate horizon to mitigate distribution shift (i.e., the gap between on-policy and past off-policy samples). (2) Moreover, a longer model rollout may reduce value estimation bias but raise the variance of policy gradients due to backpropagation through multiple steps, implying another intermediate horizon for stable gradient estimates. However, these two optimal horizons may differ. To resolve this conflict, we propose Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO), which divides the rollout procedure into a long \"distribution rollout\" (DR) and a short \"training rollout\" (TR). The DR generates on-policy state samples for mitigating distribution shift. In contrast, the short TR leverages differentiable transitions to offer accurate value gradient estimation with stable gradient updates, thereby requiring fewer updates and reducing overall runtime. We demonstrate that the double-horizon approach effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, and surpasses existing MBRL methods on continuous-control benchmarks in terms of both sample efficiency and runtime."}

In this work, we address this gap by introducing Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to quantify the maximum achievable effectiveness of DRAs for a given data instance and FL model. We derive a tight and computable upper bound for InvLoss and explore its implications from three perspectives. First, we show that DRA risk is governed by the spectral properties of the Jacobian matrix of exchanged model updates or feature embeddings, providing a unified explanation for the effectiveness of defense methods.

Although most of them are the subject of ongoing studies, typical approaches face critical challenges: post-processing methods tend to compromise performance, which is often counteracted by fine-tuning or, worse, training from scratch, an often time-consuming or even unavailable strategy. This raises the following question: \"Can we efficiently edit models to satisfy requirements, without sacrificing their utility?\" In this work, we approach this with a unifying framework, in a data-driven manner, i.e. we learn to edit neural networks (NNs), where the editor is an NN itself - a graph metanetwork - and editing amounts to a single inference step. In particular, the metanetwork is trained on NN populations to minimise an objective consisting of two terms: the requirement to be enforced and the preservation of the NN's utility. We experiment with diverse tasks (the data minimisation principle, bias mitigation and weight pruning) improving the trade-offs between performance, requirement satisfaction and time efficiency compared to popular post-processing or re-training alternatives."}

SDLs are successfully used in materials science, chemistry, and beyond, to optimise processes, materials, and devices in a systematic and data-efficient way. At present, the most widely used algorithm to identify the most informative next experiment is Bayesian optimisation. While relatively simple to apply to a wide range of optimisation problems, standard Bayesian optimisation relies on a fixed experimental workflow with a clear set of optimisation parameters and one or more measurable objective functions. This excludes the possibility of making on-the-fly decisions about changes in the planned sequence of operations and including intermediate measurements in the decision-making process. Therefore, many real-world experiments need to be adapted and simplified to be converted to the common setting in self-driving labs. In this paper, we introduce an extension to Bayesian optimisation that allows flexible sampling of multi-stage workflows and makes optimal decisions based on intermediate observables, which we call proxy measurements. We systematically compare the advantage of taking into account proxy measurements over conventional Bayesian optimisation, in which only the final measurement is observed. We find that over a wide range of scenarios, proxy measurements yield a substantial improvement, both in the time to find good solutions and in the overall optimality of found solutions. This not only paves the way to use more complex and thus more realistic experimental workflows in autonomous labs but also to smoothly combine simulations and experiments in the next generation of SDLs."}

However, when dealing with unlabeled incomplete multi-view data, where some samples are missing in certain views, existing methods typically first impute the missing data and then concatenate all views into a single dataset for subsequent co-selection. Such a strategy treats co-selection and missing data imputation as two independent processes, overlooking potential interactions between them. The inter-sample relationships gleaned from co-selection can aid imputation, which in turn enhances co-selection performance. Additionally, simply merging multi-view data fails to capture the complementary information among views, ultimately limiting co-selection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel co-selection method, termed Joint learning of Unsupervised multI-view feature and instance Co-selection with cross-viEw imputation (JUICE). JUICE first reconstructs incomplete multi-view data using available observations, bringing missing data recovery and feature and instance co-selection together in a unified framework. Then, JUICE leverages cross-view neighborhood information to learn inter-sample relationships and further refine the imputation of missing values during reconstruction.

We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement.

These challenges are intensified by the complex nature of real-world interactions, where diverse user intents are entangled and collaborative signals rarely align with linguistic semantics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BEAT, a unified and transferable framework that tokenizes user and item behaviors into discrete, interpretable sequences. We construct a behavior vocabulary via a vector-quantized autoencoding process that disentangles macro-level interests and micro-level intentions from graph-based representations. We then introduce multi-level semantic supervision to bridge the gap between behavioral signals and language space. A semantic alignment regularization mechanism is designed to embed behavior tokens directly into the input space of frozen language models. Experiments on three public datasets show that BEAT improves zero-shot recommendation performance while generating coherent and informative explanations.

Based on the transformed data, the Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic is constructed, enabling the formulation of anomaly detection as a statistical hypothesis test of network conformity to normal operating conditions. It is shown that Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic can serve as an integral indicator of the overall \"health\" of the system, exhibiting correlation with total leakage volume, and thereby enabling approximate estimation of water losses via a regression model. A heuristic algorithm is developed to analyze the $T^2$ time series and classify detected anomalies into abrupt leaks, incipient leaks, and sensor malfunctions. Furthermore, a coarse leak localization method is proposed, which ranks sensors according to their statistical contribution and employs Laplacian interpolation to approximate the affected region within the network.

Gradient-Guided Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has become essential for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet current exploration mechanisms remain fundamentally misaligned with how these models actually learn. Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods. Analyzing the induced geometry, we find that G2RL expands exploration into substantially more orthogonal and often opposing gradient directions while maintaining semantic coherence, revealing that a policy own update space provides a far more faithful and effective basis for guiding exploration in large language model reinforcement learning."}

To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information.

We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition.

We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent).

We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent).

A Structural Rebuttal to OpenAI's Hallucination Thesis", "abstract": "OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility."}

Methods:Fast high-resolution wu-MRSI was acquired at 7T with non-cartesian ECCENTRIC sampling and ultra-short echo time. A water and lipid removal network (WALINET+) was developed to remove lipids, water signal, and sidebands. MRSI reconstruction was performed by DeepER and a physics-informed network for metabolite fitting. Water signal was used for absolute metabolite quantification, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and myelin water fraction imaging (MWF). Results: WALINET+ provided the lowest NRMSE (< 2%) in simulations and in vivo the smallest bias (< 20%) and limits-of-agreement (+-63%) between wu-MRSI and ws-MRSI scans.

The neural network discretization of the solution field is naturally adaptive and avoids meshing the computational domain, which can both improve the accuracy of the numerical solution and streamline implementation. However, there have been limited studies of PINNs on complex three-dimensional geometries, as the lack of mesh and the reliance on the strong form of the partial differential equation (PDE) make boundary condition (BC) enforcement challenging. Techniques to enforce BCs with PINNs have proliferated in the literature, but a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of these techniques and a study of their efficacy on geometrically complex three-dimensional test problems are lacking. In this work, we i) systematically compare BC enforcement techniques for PINNs, ii) propose a general solution framework for arbitrary three-dimensional geometries, and iii) verify the methodology on three-dimensional, linear and nonlinear test problems with combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundaries. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying PDE, the geometry of the computational domain, and the nature of the BCs, while requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning.

With more LLM users, the KV cache footprint can easily exceed GPU memory capacity, so prior work has proposed to either evict KV cache to lower-tier storage devices, or compress KV cache so that more KV cache can be fit in the fast memory. However, prior work misses an important opportunity: jointly optimizing the eviction and compression decisions across all KV caches to minimize average generation latency without hurting quality.We propose EVICPRESS, a KV-cache management system that applies lossy compression and adaptive eviction to KV cache across multiple storage tiers. Specifically, for each KV cache of a context, EVICPRESS considers the effect of compression and eviction of the KV cache on the average generation quality and delay across all contexts as a whole. To achieve this, EVICPRESS proposes a unified utility function that quantifies the effect of quality and delay of the lossy compression or eviction. To this end, EVICPRESS's profiling module periodically updates the utility function scores on all possible eviction-compression configurations for all contexts and places KV caches using a fast heuristic to rearrange KV caches on all storage tiers, with the goal of maximizing the utility function scores on each storage tier. Compared to the baselines that evict KV cache or compress KV cache, EVICPRESS achieves higher KV-cache hit rates on fast devices, i.e., lower delay, while preserving high generation quality by applying conservative compression to contexts that are sensitive to compression errors. Evaluation on 12 datasets and 5 models demonstrates that EVICPRESS achieves up to 2.19x faster time-to-first-token (TTFT) at equivalent generation quality."}

Since this requires both models to share the same probability space, it becomes challenging when the teacher and student LMs use different tokenizers, for instance, when edge-device deployment necessitates a smaller vocabulary size to lower memory overhead. In this work, we address this vocabulary misalignment problem by uncovering an implicit recursive structure in the commonly deployed Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm and utilizing it to create a probabilistic framework for cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring. Our method enables sequence likelihood evaluation for vocabularies different from the teacher model native tokenizer, addressing two specific scenarios: when the student vocabulary is a subset of the teacher vocabulary, and the general case where it is arbitrary. In the subset regime, our framework computes exact likelihoods and provides next-token probabilities for sequential sampling with only O(1) model evaluations per token. When used for distillation, this yields up to a 12% reduction in memory footprint for the Qwen2.5-1.5B model while also improving baseline performance up to 4% on the evaluated tasks.

According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure.

A key goal is the prioritization of high risk, security-related bugs. If such bugs can be recognized early, the risk of propagation to dependent products and endangerment of stakeholder benefits can be mitigated. To assist triage engineers with this task, several automatic detection techniques, from Machine Learning (ML) models to prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), have been proposed. Although promising to some extent, prior techniques often memorize lexical cues as decision shortcuts, yielding low detection rate specifically for more complex submissions. As such, these classifiers do not yet reach the practical expectations of a real-time detector of security-related issues. To address these limitations, we propose SEBERTIS, a framework to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as classifiers independent of lexical cues, so that they can confidently detect fully unseen security-related issues. SEBERTIS capitalizes on fine-tuning bidirectional transformer architectures as Masked Language Models (MLMs) on a series of semantically equivalent vocabulary to prediction labels (which we call Semantic Surrogates) when they have been replaced with a mask.

The performance of the IGA-SVR model is rigorously evaluated and compared against the state-of-the-art baseline models, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the forward-validating genetic algorithm optimized support vector regression (OGA-SVR). Extensive testing was conducted on the five global indices, namely Nifty, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), DAX Performance Index (DAX), Nikkei 225 (N225), and Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSE) from 2021 to 2024 of daily price prediction up to a year. Overall, the proposed IGA-SVR model achieved a reduction in MAPE by 19.87% compared to LSTM and 50.03% compared to OGA-SVR, demonstrating its superior performance in long-term daily price forecasting of global indices. Further, the execution time for LSTM was approximately 20 times higher than that of IGA-SVR, highlighting the high accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed model. The genetic algorithm selects the optimal hyperparameters of SVR by minimizing the arithmetic mean of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) calculated over the full training dataset and the most recent five years of training data. This purposefully designed training methodology adjusts for recent trends while retaining long-term trend information, thereby offering enhanced generalization compared to the LSTM and rolling-forward validation approach employed by OGA-SVR, which forgets long-term trends and suffers from recency bias."}

In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted.

This paper introduces a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to model such effects using only input-output audio recordings, removing the need for modulation signal extraction. We propose a convolutional-recurrent architecture trained via a two-stage strategy: an initial adversarial phase allows the model to learn the distribution of the modulation behavior without strict phase constraints, followed by a supervised fine-tuning phase where a State Prediction Network (SPN) estimates the initial internal states required to synchronize the model with the target. Additionally, a new objective metric based on chirp-train signals is developed to quantify modulation accuracy. Experiments modeling a vintage hardware phaser demonstrate the method's ability to capture time-varying dynamics in a fully black-box context."}

In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an \"Expand-and-Prune\" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs.

The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead.

Existing methods assume access to the robot's internal state, but auditors are often limited to external observations (e.g., video footage). This ``Physical Observation Gap'' means the watermark must be detected from signals that are noisy, asynchronous, and filtered by unknown system dynamics. We formalize this challenge using the concept of a \\textit{glimpse sequence}, and introduce Colored Noise Coherency (CoNoCo), the first watermarking strategy designed for remote detection. CoNoCo embeds a spectral signal into the robot's motions by leveraging the policy's inherent stochasticity.

Our experiments demonstrate strong, robust detection across various remote modalities, including motion capture and side-way/top-down video footage, in both simulated and real-world robot experiments.

The potential of conditioned approaches for such tasks has been somewhat hidden due to a lack of suitable data, an issue recently addressed with the MoisesDb dataset.

We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific \"superintelligence\". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery."}

To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration.

We apply a physics-encoded KA-CRNN to learn SOC-dependent kinetic parameters for cathode-electrolyte decomposition directly from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. A mechanistically informed reaction pathway is embedded into the network architecture, enabling the activation energies, pre-exponential factors, enthalpies, and related parameters to be represented as continuous and fully interpretable functions of the SOC. The framework is demonstrated for NCA, NM, and NMA cathodes, yielding models that reproduce DSC heat-release features across all SOCs and provide interpretable insight into SOC-dependent oxygen-release and phase-transformation mechanisms.

Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations."}

This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce \\model, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations.

Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable. DREX also efficiently handles the missing KV cache from skipped layers using memory-efficient state-copying. Our evaluation shows that DREX improves throughput by 2-12% compared to baseline approaches while maintaining output quality. Crucially, DREX completely eliminates involuntary exits, providing a key guarantee for preserving the output quality intended by the EE model."}

Specifically, an encoder compresses activations to a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder reads this list and answers a natural language question about the model. We show how to pretrain this assistant on large unstructured data, then finetune it to answer questions. The resulting architecture, which we call a Predictive Concept Decoder, enjoys favorable scaling properties: the auto-interp score of the bottleneck concepts improves with data, as does the performance on downstream applications. Specifically, PCDs can detect jailbreaks, secret hints, and implanted latent concepts, and are able to accurately surface latent user attributes."}

Proposed solutions to catastrophic forgetting tend to involve storing information about past tasks, meaning that memory usage is a chief consideration in determining their practicality. This paper develops a memory-efficient solution to catastrophic forgetting using the idea of matrix sketching, in the context of a simple continual learning algorithm known as orthogonal gradient descent (OGD). OGD finds weight updates that aim to preserve performance on prior datapoints, using gradients of the model on those datapoints. However, since the memory cost of storing prior model gradients grows with the runtime of the algorithm, OGD is ill-suited to continual learning over long time horizons. To address this problem, we propose SketchOGD. SketchOGD employs an online sketching algorithm to compress model gradients as they are encountered into a matrix of a fixed, user-determined size. In contrast to existing memory-efficient variants of OGD, SketchOGD runs online without the need for advance knowledge of the total number of tasks, is simple to implement, and is more amenable to analysis. We provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error of the relevant sketches under a novel metric suited to the downstream task of OGD. Experimentally, we find that SketchOGD tends to outperform current state-of-the-art variants of OGD given a fixed memory budget."}

The dual-stream base pretraining combines self-supervised contrastive learning for general features and supervised learning for class-specific knowledge, followed by the representation enhancing distillation to merge both streams, enhancing representations for subsequent CIL paradigm. To utilize more knowledge from the backbone, REAL presents a feature fusion buffer to multi-layer backbone features, providing informative features for the subsequent classifier training. Our method can be incorporated into existing ACL techniques and provides more competitive performance.

We validate the performance of of the approach on two datasets: monitoring sensor data of the readout-box system of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN, and a public data set for information technology monitoring. The results on temporal GCMs demonstrate a considerable reduction of computation overhead and a moderate enhancement of accuracy on the binary anomaly data sets. Source code:this https URL."}

In this work, we argue that Bayesian optimization algorithms with sparse GPs can more efficiently allocate their representational power to relevant regions of the search space. To achieve this, we propose focalized GP, which leverages a novel variational loss function to achieve stronger local prediction, as well as FocalBO, which hierarchically optimizes the focalized GP acquisition function over progressively smaller search spaces.

The prevalence and success of these applications have remained largely unexamined, as recent reviews on the use of machine learning in archaeology have only focused only on specific subfields of archaeology. Our review examined an exhaustive corpus of 135 articles published between 1997 and 2022. We observed a significant increase in the number of publications from 2019 onwards. Automatic structure detection and artefact classification were the most represented tasks in the articles reviewed, followed by taphonomy, and archaeological predictive modelling. From the review, clustering and unsupervised methods were underrepresented compared to supervised models. Artificial neural networks and ensemble learning account for two thirds of the total number of models used. However, if machine learning models are gaining in popularity they remain subject to misunderstanding. We observed, in some cases, poorly defined requirements and caveats of the machine learning methods used. Furthermore, the goals and the needs of machine learning applications for archaeological purposes are in some cases unclear or poorly expressed. To address this, we proposed a workflow guide for archaeologists to develop coherent and consistent methodologies adapted to their research questions, project scale and data. As in many other areas, machine learning is rapidly becoming an important tool in archaeological research and practice, useful for the analyses of large and multivariate data, although not without limitations. This review highlights the importance of well-defined and well-reported structured methodologies and collaborative practices to maximise the potential of applications of machine learning methods in archaeology."}

The objective is to find solutions $s$ that minimize $d(s)$ while having high probability under $Ł(s)$, effectively sampling from a target distribution proportional to $Ł(s) \\cdot e^{-T \\cdot d(s)}$ for a temperature parameter $T$.While this framework aligns with classical Model-Based Optimization (e.g., the Cross-Entropy method), existing theory is ill-suited for deriving sample complexity bounds in black-box deep generative models.

Despite recent advancements and the success of different architectures, forecasting is often challenging due to non-stationary nature of the real-world data, which frequently exhibit distribution shifts and temporal changes in statistical properties like mean and variance over time. Previous studies suggest that this inherent variability complicates forecasting, limiting the performance of many models by leading to loss of non-stationarity and resulting in over-stationarization (Liu, Wu, Wang and Long, 2022). To address this challenge, we introduce a novel architecture, ChoronoAdaptive Network (CANet), inspired by style-transfer techniques. The core of CANet is the Non-stationary Adaptive Normalization module, seamlessly integrating the Style Blending Gate and Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) (Huang and Belongie, 2017). The Style Blending Gate preserves and reintegrates non-stationary characteristics, such as mean and standard deviation, by blending internal and external statistics, preventing over-stationarization while maintaining essential temporal dependencies. Coupled with AdaIN, which dynamically adapts the model to statistical changes, this approach enhances predictive accuracy under non-stationary conditions. CANet also employs multi-resolution patching to handle short-term fluctuations and long-term trends, along with Fourier analysis-based adaptive thresholding to reduce noise. A Stacked Kronecker Product Layer further optimizes the model's efficiency while maintaining high performance. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate CANet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 42% reduction in MSE and a 22% reduction in MAE.

Applying them to urban settings, however, presents unique challenges: urban networks exhibit greater structural diversity, traffic volumes are highly overdispersed with many zeros, the best way to account for spatial dependencies remains unclear, and sensor coverage is often very sparse. We introduce the Graph Neural Network for Urban Interpolation (GNNUI), a novel urban traffic volume estimation approach. GNNUI employs a masking algorithm to learn interpolation, integrates node features to capture functional roles, and uses a loss function tailored to zero-inflated traffic distributions. In addition to the model, we introduce two new open, large-scale urban traffic volume benchmarks, covering different transportation modes: Strava cycling data from Berlin and New York City taxi data. GNNUI outperforms recent, some graph-based, interpolation methods across metrics (MAE, RMSE, true-zero rate, Kullback-Leibler divergence) and remains robust from 90% to 1% sensor coverage. For example, on the Strava dataset, the MAE increases only from 7.1 to 10.5, and on the Taxi dataset, from 23.0 to 40.4. These results demonstrate that GNNUI maintains strong performance despite extreme data scarcity, a common condition in real-world urban settings. We also examine how graph connectivity choices influence model accuracy."}

To address this, we introduce a method to enrich pLMs with structural knowledge by leveraging pre-trained protein graph neural networks (pGNNs). First, a latent-level contrastive learning task aligns residue representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins, injecting inter-protein structural information. Additionally, a physical-level task integrates intra-protein information by training pLMs to predict structure tokens. Together, the proposed dual-task framework effectively incorporates both inter- and intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a residue loss selection module that uses a small model trained on high-quality structures to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn. Applying our structure alignment method as a simple, lightweight post-training step to the state-of-the-art ESM2 and AMPLIFY yields notable performance gains. These improvements are consistent across a wide range of tasks, including substantial gains in deep mutational scanning (DMS) fitness prediction and a 59% increase in P@L for ESM2 650M contact prediction on CASP16.

Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective: rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator, which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight matrices. Our method can be seamlessly integrated with existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4 semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points.

In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference more closely."}

In this work, our empirical analysis reveals that pre-training on massive web-scale corpora leaves Qwen2.5 susceptible to data contamination in widely used benchmarks. Consequently, conclusions derived from contaminated benchmarks on Qwen2.5 series may be unreliable. To obtain trustworthy evaluation results, we introduce a generator that creates fully clean arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, dubbed RandomCalculation. Using this leakage-free dataset, we show that only accurate reward signals yield steady improvements that surpass the base model's performance boundary in mathematical reasoning, whereas random or incorrect rewards do not. Moreover, we conduct more fine-grained analyses to elucidate the factors underlying the different performance observed on the MATH-500 and RandomCalculation benchmarks.

A natural alternative is to distribute training across multiple data centers over wide-area networks. This pools distributed resources, but suffers from high latency and low, time-varying bandwidth, sharply reducing throughout. Employing jointly gradient compression and delayed aggregation can alleviate communication problems, but introduces a complex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed synchronization steps), and convergence rate. Existing work lacks theoretical guidance and can only propose fixed strategies, insensitive to computation and communication conditions. We address this with a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization problem into a traditional process plus multiple analyzable noise terms. Our analysis yields the first convergence rate for this setting and shows that increasing staleness exponentially amplifies the detrimental effect of compression. Leveraging these insights, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically selects the compression ratio and staleness based on the real-time communication and computation conditions.

Once data or component number increases, the scalability of these MCR approaches face significant challenges. This study reformulates MCR as a data generative process (gMCR), and introduces an Energy-Based solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the smallest component set and their concentrations for reconstructing the mixed signals faithfully. On synthetic benchmarks with up to 256 components, EB-gMCR attains high reconstruction fidelity and recovers the component count within 5% at 20dB noise and near-exact at 30dB.

EB-gMCR is a general solver for fixed-pattern signal unmixing (components remain invariant across mixtures).

Different tensor decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review, we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs, including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities, ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way, and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions for the theory of deep NNs."}

Our approach is motivated by viewing guided generation as an entropy-regularized stochastic optimal control problem over ARDM trajectories: we learn a reusable policy that injects small control corrections inside each denoising sub-step while remaining anchored to the pretrained dynamics. We evaluate this framework in the context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs), where existing methods can be computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse observations.

We study learning from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input dimension $d$.

However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic, an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers - reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers."}

We also show that this non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without retraining.

Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization."}

Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration.

Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details.

Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%).

We propose the \\emph{conditional kernel calibration error} (CKCE) which is based on the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the difference between conditional mean operators. By working directly with the definition of strong calibration as the distance between conditional distributions, which we represent by their embeddings in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, the CKCE is less sensitive to the marginal distribution of predictive models. This makes it more effective for relative comparisons than previously proposed calibration metrics. Our experiments, using both synthetic and real data, show that CKCE provides a more consistent ranking of models by their calibration error and is more robust against distribution shift."}

In epidemiology with rapidly mutating viruses, designing effective primers is challenging. Traditional methods require substantial manual intervention and struggle to ensure effective primer design across different strains. For organisms with large, similar genomes like Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri, differentiating between species is also difficult but crucial.Results: We developed Primer C-VAE, a model based on a Variational Auto-Encoder framework with Convolutional Neural Networks to identify variants and generate specific primers. Using SARS-CoV-2, our model classified variants (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, omicron) with 98% accuracy and generated variant-specific primers. These primers appeared with >95% frequency in target variants and <5% in others, showing good performance in in-silico PCR tests. For Alpha, Delta, and Omicron, our primer pairs produced fragments <200 bp, suitable for qPCR detection. The model also generated effective primers for organisms with longer gene sequences like E. coli and S. flexneri.Conclusion: Primer C-VAE is an interpretable deep learning approach for developing specific primer pairs for target organisms. This flexible, semi-automated and reliable tool works regardless of sequence completeness and length, allowing for qPCR applications and can be applied to organisms with large and highly similar genomes."}

We investigate the advantages and disadvantages of using a deterministic global solver (MAiNGO) compared to conventional local and stochastic global solvers (L-BFGS-B and multi-start, respectively) for the optimization of the acquisition function. For CPU efficiency, we set a time limit for MAiNGO, taking the best point as optimal. We perform repeated numerical experiments, initially using the Muller-Brown potential as a benchmark function, utilizing the lower confidence bound acquisition function; we further validate our findings with three alternative benchmark functions. Statistical analysis reveals that when the acquisition function is more exploitative (as opposed to exploratory), BO with MAiNGO converges in fewer iterations than with the local solvers. However, when the dataset lacks diversity, or when the acquisition function is overly exploitative, BO with MAiNGO, compared to the local solvers, is more likely to converge to a local rather than a global ly near-optimal solution of the black-box function. L-BFGS-B and multi-start mitigate this risk in BO by introducing stochasticity in the selection of the next sampling point, which enhances the exploration of uncharted regions in the search space and reduces dependence on acquisition function hyperparameters. Ultimately, suboptimal optimization of poorly chosen acquisition functions may be preferable to their optimal solution. When the acquisition function is more exploratory, BO with MAiNGO, multi-start, and L-BFGS-B achieve comparable probabilities of convergence to a globally near-optimal solution (although BO with MAiNGO may require more iterations to converge under these conditions)."}

With recent advances in robotics and machine learning, there is a growing demand for these systems to operate in complex and unstructured environments. Traditional model-based approaches struggle to generalize across tasks and object variations due to the high dimensionality and complex contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation. Although model-free methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) show promise, they require extensive training, large-scale interaction data, and carefully designed rewards for stability and effectiveness. Imitation learning (IL) offers an alternative by allowing robots to acquire dexterous manipulation skills directly from expert demonstrations, capturing fine-grained coordination and contact dynamics while bypassing the need for explicit modeling and large-scale trial-and-error. This survey provides an overview of dexterous manipulation methods based on imitation learning, details recent advances, and addresses key challenges in the field. Additionally, it explores potential research directions to enhance IL-driven dexterous manipulation.

CREDO reformulates decision risk through the inverse feasible region -- the set of outcomes under which a decision is optimal -- and estimates its probability using inner approximations constructed from conformal prediction balls generated by a conditional generative model.

We present the first systematic study of gold context size in long-context question answering, spanning three diverse benchmarks (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical reasoning), eleven state-of-the-art LLMs (including recent reasoning models), and more than 150K controlled runs. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops sharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts consistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity, posing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered, fine-grained information of varying lengths. This effect persists under rigorous confounder analysis: even after controlling for gold context position, answer token repetition, gold-to-distractor ratio, distractor volume, and domain specificity, gold context size remains a decisive, independent predictor of success.

Using a public space study with 40 participants performing a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and annotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks (Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension control).

Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems."}

We propose augmenting training datasets with synthetic data generated using GenAI techniques to improve classifier generalization. We evaluate this approach across 7 diverse security tasks using 6 state-of-the-art GenAI methods and introduce a novel GenAI scheme called Nimai that enables highly controlled data synthesis.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that GenAI can facilitate rapid adaptation to concept drift post-deployment, requiring minimal labeling in the adjustment process. Despite successes, our study finds that some GenAI schemes struggle to initialize (train and produce data) on certain security tasks.

The emergence of these methods prompts a revisit to the impact of data preprocessing, a topic familiar to the climate community, as more traditional statistical models work with relatively small sample sizes. Indeed, the skill and confidence in the forecasts produced by data-driven models are directly influenced by the quality of the datasets and how they are treated during model development, thus yielding the colloquialism, \"garbage in, garbage out.\" As such, this article establishes protocols for the proper preprocessing of input data for AI/ML models designed for climate prediction (i.e., subseasonal to decadal and longer). The three aims are to: (1) educate researchers, developers, and end users on the effects that preprocessing has on climate predictions; (2) provide recommended practices for data preprocessing for such applications; and (3) empower end users to decipher whether the models they are using are properly designed for their objectives. Specific topics covered in this article include the creation of (standardized) anomalies, dealing with non-stationarity and the spatiotemporally correlated nature of climate data, and handling of extreme values and variables with potentially complex distributions. Case studies will illustrate how using different preprocessing techniques can produce different predictions from the same model, which can create confusion and decrease confidence in the overall process. Ultimately, implementing the recommended practices set forth in this article will enhance the robustness and transparency of AI/ML in climate prediction studies."}

To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and GatedDeltaNet to augment open-weight LLMs. We also propose an efficient self-distillation training method where the base model's all parameters are frozen and only the parameters from AHNs are optimized.

Finally, we document pronounced regional heterogeneity, as certain asset classes and emerging markets exhibit heightened sensitivity to shocks in policy rates, global financial volatility, and geopolitical risk."}

We study the resulting computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and transparent proofs."}

Existing multimodal and meta learning approaches improve performance in these settings but lack a theoretical explanation of why or when they succeed. This paper presents a unified theoretical framework for few shot multimodal medical imaging that jointly characterizes sample complexity, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. Using PAC learning, VC theory, and PAC Bayesian analysis, we derive bounds that describe the minimum number of labeled samples required for reliable performance and show how complementary modalities reduce effective capacity through an information gain term. We further introduce a formal metric for explanation stability, proving that explanation variance decreases at an inverse n rate. A sequential Bayesian interpretation of Chain of Thought reasoning is also developed to show stepwise posterior contraction. To illustrate these ideas, we implement a controlled multimodal dataset and evaluate an additive CNN MLP fusion model under few shot regimes, confirming predicted multimodal gains, modality interference at larger sample sizes, and shrinking predictive uncertainty.

There are now several documented examples where they have helped professional mathematical scientists prove new results, sometimes even helping resolve known open problems. In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations. In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023,arXiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp.Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science."}

However, current methods remain unreliable: without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process acts as a black box that may oscillate, loop, or diverge. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination in multi-stage verification pipelines. We model the interaction not as a generic loop, but as a sequential absorbing Markov Chain comprising four essential engineering stages: \\texttt{CodeGen}, \\texttt{Compilation}, \\texttt{InvariantSynth}, and \\texttt{SMTSolving}. We prove that for any non-zero stage success probability ($\\delta > 0$), the system reaches the \\texttt{Verified} state almost surely. Furthermore, because of the sequential nature of the pipeline, we derive a precise latency bound of $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/\\delta$. We stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising over 90,000 trials. The results match the theory with striking consistency: every run reached verification, and the empirical convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx 1.0$, confirming that the $4/\\delta$ bound accurately mirrors system behavior rather than serving as a loose buffer. Based on this data, we identify three distinct operating zones -- marginal, practical, and high-performance -- and propose a dynamic calibration strategy to handle parameter drift in real-world environments.

Yet such conclusions can be surprisingly fragile: even minor data errors - duplicate records, or entry mistakes - may drastically alter causal relationships. This raises a fundamental question: how robust is a causal claim to small, targeted modifications in the data? Addressing this question is essential for ensuring the reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility of empirical findings. We introduce SubCure, a framework for robustness auditing via cardinality repairs. Given a causal query and a user-specified target range for the estimated effect, SubCure identifies a small set of tuples or subpopulations whose removal shifts the estimate into the desired range. This process not only quantifies the sensitivity of causal conclusions but also pinpoints the specific regions of the data that drive those conclusions. We formalize this problem under both tuple- and pattern-level deletion settings and show both are NP-complete. To scale to large datasets, we develop efficient algorithms that incorporate machine unlearning techniques to incrementally update causal estimates without retraining from scratch. We evaluate SubCure across four real-world datasets covering diverse application domains. In each case, it uncovers compact, high-impact subsets whose removal significantly shifts the causal conclusions, revealing vulnerabilities that traditional methods fail to detect. Our results demonstrate that cardinality repair is a powerful and general-purpose tool for stress-testing causal analyses and guarding against misleading claims rooted in ordinary data imperfections."}

We introduce the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), a scalable software engineering agent that can operate at large-scale codebases. CCA is built on top of the Confucius SDK, an agent development platform structured around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK integrates a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension system for reliable tool use. In addition, we introduce a meta-agent that automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks, environments, and tool stacks.

We formulate flow matching in an infinite-dimensional function space to learn a probabilistic transport that maps low-fidelity approximations to the manifold of high-fidelity PDE solutions via learned residual corrections. We develop a conditional neural operator architecture based on feature-wise linear modulation for flow matching vector fields directly in function space, enabling inference at arbitrary spatial resolutions without retraining. To improve stability and representational control of the induced neural ODE, we parameterize the flow vector field as a sum of a linear operator and a nonlinear operator, combining lightweight linear components with a conditioned Fourier neural operator for expressive, input-dependent dynamics. We then formulate a residual-augmented learning strategy where the flow model learns probabilistic corrections from inexpensive low-fidelity surrogates to high-fidelity solutions, rather than learning the full solution mapping from scratch. Finally, we derive tractable training objectives that extend conditional flow matching to the operator setting with input-function-dependent couplings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present numerical experiments on a range of PDEs, including the 1D advection and Burgers' equation, and a 2D Darcy flow problem for flow through a porous medium.

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive."}

Our analysis shows that Maven exhibits mean amplification of 24.70 times, compared to 4.48 times for Go Modules, 4.32 times for npm, and 0.32 times for CocoaPods. We find significant differences with large effect sizes in 22 of 45 pairwise comparisons, challenging the assumption that npm has the highest amplification due to its many small purpose packages.

We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute.

We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \\cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points. We hypothesize the gains come from short prompts, aggressive context management, and conditional tool use. Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success.

To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load."}

Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold. However, most proactive moderation strategies are manual, requiring significant time and effort from community maintainers. To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \\textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \\textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of structured LLM prompting for early detection of conversational derailment in OSS, enabling proactive and explainable moderation."}

Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs. The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers.

Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web", "abstract": "Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture."}

In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions.

This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection.

This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the \"two-language problem\": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++.

One of the regular, unfortunate casualties of provisional accelerator control system updates is their human-system interfaces (HSIs) which often lag behind modern usability and design standards. An additional challenge is that although there is a multitude of established human factors (HF), and user experience (UX) principles for everyday digital applications, there are very few (if any) established principles for complex and safety-critical applications for an accelerator. This paper argues for the importance of established HF and UX principles (herein referred to as human-centered design principles) into the development of accelerator HSIs, emphasizing the need for clarity, consistency, responsiveness, and cognitive accessibility. Drawing from HF/UX best practices and human-centered design, this paper discusses how these approaches can enhance operator performance, reduce human error, and improve accelerator personnel collaboration. Case studies from Accelerator Control Operations Research Network (ACORN) at Fermilab are explored to demonstrate how interfaces built with human-centered design principles can scale with system complexity while remaining intuitive and efficient for diverse user roles including operators, machine experts, and engineers. By bridging the gap between traditional control system design and modern human-centered design methods, this paper provides a roadmap for evolving accelerator HSIs into more usable, maintainable, and effective tools."}

This paper examines how an internal audit function could be designed to provide meaningful assurance for frontier AI developers, and the practical trade-offs that shape its effectiveness. Drawing on professional internal auditing standards, risk-based assurance theory, and emerging frontier-AI governance literature, we analyze four core design dimensions: (i) audit scope across model-level, system-level, and governance-level controls; (ii) sourcing arrangements (in-house, co-sourced, and outsourced); (iii) audit frequency and cadence; and (iv) access to sensitive information required for credible assurance. For each dimension, we define the relevant option space, assess benefits and limitations, and identify key organizational and security trade-offs. Our findings suggest that internal audit, if deliberately designed for the frontier AI context, can play a central role in strengthening safety governance, complementing external evaluations, and providing boards and regulators with higher-confidence, system-wide assurance over catastrophic risk controls."}

In particular, none of the 3 tasks were solved privacy-compliant by all 30 participants, with the non-prompted group having the lowest number of 3 out of 30 privacy-compliant solution attempts. Privacy prompting and expert support only slightly improved participants' submissions, with 6/30 and 8/30 privacy-compliant attempts, respectively. In fact, all participants reported severe issues addressing common privacy requirements such as purpose limitation, user consent, or data minimization. Counterintuitively, although most developers exhibited minimal confidence in their solutions, they rarely sought online assistance or contacted the privacy expert, with only 4 out of 10 expert-supported participants explicitly asking for compliance confirmation. Instead, participants often relied on existing implementations and focused on implementing functionality and security first."}

The generation of WPs is an important task with practical applications in areas ranging from verification to run-time error checking. This paper proposes the combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fuzz testing for generating WPs. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce \\emph{Fuzzing Guidance} (FG); FG acts as a means of directing LLMs towards correct WPs using program execution feedback. FG utilises fuzz testing for approximately checking the validity and weakness of candidate WPs, this information is then fed back to the LLM as a means of context refinement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a comprehensive benchmark set of deterministic array programs in Java. Our experiments indicate that LLMs are capable of producing viable candidate WPs, and that this ability can be practically enhanced through FG."}

Unfortunately, most issues do not come with functioning reproduction tests, so this paper explores how to generate them automatically. The primary challenge in this setting is that the code to be tested is either missing or wrong, as evidenced by the existence of the issue in the first place. This has held back test generation for this setting: without the correct code to execute, it is difficult to leverage execution feedback to generate good tests. This paper introduces novel techniques for leveraging execution feedback to get around this problem, implemented in a new reproduction test generator called e-Otter++. Experiments show that e-Otter++ represents a leap ahead in the state-of-the-art for this problem, generating tests with an average fail-to-pass rate of 63% on the TDD-Bench Verified benchmark."}

We present T2L-Agent (Trace-to-Line Agent), a project-level, end-to-end framework that plans its own analysis and progressively narrows scope from modules to exact vulnerable lines. T2L-Agent couples multi-round feedback with an Agentic Trace Analyzer (ATA) that fuses run-time evidence such as crash points, stack traces, and coverage deltas with AST-based code chunking, enabling iterative refinement beyond single pass predictions and translating symptoms into actionable, line-level diagnoses. To benchmark line-level vulnerability discovery, we introduce T2L-ARVO, a diverse, expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash families and real-world projects. T2L-ARVO is specifically designed to support both coarse-grained detection and fine-grained localization, enabling rigorous evaluation of systems that aim to move beyond file-level predictions. On T2L-ARVO, T2L-Agent achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level localization, substantially outperforming baselines. Together, the framework and benchmark push LLM-based vulnerability detection from coarse identification toward deployable, robust, precision diagnostics that reduce noise and accelerate patching in open-source software workflows."}

Lyu", "title": "3D Software Synthesis Guided by Constraint-Expressive Intermediate Representation", "abstract": "Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously. Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method."}

However, current methods remain unreliable: without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process acts as a black box that may oscillate, loop, or diverge. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination in multi-stage verification pipelines. We model the interaction not as a generic loop, but as a sequential absorbing Markov Chain comprising four essential engineering stages: \\texttt{CodeGen}, \\texttt{Compilation}, \\texttt{InvariantSynth}, and \\texttt{SMTSolving}. We prove that for any non-zero stage success probability ($\\delta > 0$), the system reaches the \\texttt{Verified} state almost surely. Furthermore, because of the sequential nature of the pipeline, we derive a precise latency bound of $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/\\delta$. We stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising over 90,000 trials. The results match the theory with striking consistency: every run reached verification, and the empirical convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx 1.0$, confirming that the $4/\\delta$ bound accurately mirrors system behavior rather than serving as a loose buffer. Based on this data, we identify three distinct operating zones -- marginal, practical, and high-performance -- and propose a dynamic calibration strategy to handle parameter drift in real-world environments. Together, these contributions replace heuristic guesswork with a rigorous architectural foundation, enabling predictable resource planning and performance budgeting for safety-critical software."}

Existing research-grade agents offer transparency but struggle when scaled to real-world workloads, while proprietary systems achieve strong practical performance but provide limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We introduce the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), a scalable software engineering agent that can operate at large-scale codebases. CCA is built on top of the Confucius SDK, an agent development platform structured around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK integrates a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension system for reliable tool use. In addition, we introduce a meta-agent that automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated with these mechanisms, CCA demonstrates strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA reaches a Resolve@1 of 54.3%, exceeding prior research baselines and comparing favorably to commercial results, under identical repositories, model backend, and tool access. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA form a general, extensible, and production-grade foundation for building effective and robust coding agents, bridging the gap between research prototypes and practical large-scale deployment."}

This paper examines the interactional friction that emerges in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) pipelines. By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity. We conclude that building natural spoken AI is an infrastructure design challenge, requiring a shift from optimizing isolated components to carefully choreographing the seams between them."}
