While the input modality (photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5, Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image, NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50 apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across different model architectures.

However, a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over extended periods, they face \"memory inflation\" and \"contextual degradation\" issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive \"Intelligent Decay\" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates, contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency.

Planning involves structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior. Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar, path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent computations, though earlier blocks remain informative."}

This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity.

However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple \"world model\" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments.

However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures, including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic, structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned generative agents.

Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g., ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks (e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We further introduce Overuse Rate ($\\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count ($\\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\\% of LLM agents display a pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall Risk Score ($\\Phi_\\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected to operational pressures.

In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity.

We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop: step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency; step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent attention on corresponding anatomy.

Choosing the right reasoning model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR (Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable, and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item response model from model responses with different budgets to different queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities."}

This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration, DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration, which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3) adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves 62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation for advancing RLVR methodologies.

One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs), which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders (e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks. Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information, showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from 44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR."}

Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities, is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval, which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood. We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG, analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems."}

Building effective representation for team coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance."}

We developed a pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level \"spot diagnosis\" cases across multiple imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested through their native web interfaces, viz.

Process rewards address this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without \"golden\" answers.

However, offering users verification of their data removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations."}

In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes, Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL). Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research, to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of more functional multi-agent systems."}

The system engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file. We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to multi-plate timed syntheses.

Our results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over 85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy (F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses.

Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior navigation performance."}

This paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism, which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency."}

This leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database, without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization.

In this work, we use circuit analysis to demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore, we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses, we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off: strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.

When ad ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors, emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained, showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals. We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality. Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied on familiar tropes.

We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN) evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500. Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14 settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades. Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS, ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension."}

However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern: embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces. Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual prompts for style control.

Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it into a \"preventative fine-tuning\", forcing the model to learn a more robust refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and utility.

The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based neural network designs.

Current code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models' coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent), which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference."}

We further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal, and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations. Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk, Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm, privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into the reasoning process.

For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata (title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information (multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas.

We benchmark well-known VLMs across different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency. To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to 41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving."}

However, standard RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks) and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp), a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains: reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to 52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance impact."}

Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability. To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions (CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision. By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world applications."}

Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios, however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive signals.

This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of \"thick description,\" we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect deeper cultural meanings--what we term \"thick outputs\"-grounded firmly in user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations, the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity."}

This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the forward and backward passes.

To investigate whether multi-agent interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components: Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion, before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales, evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies."}

Few studies demonstrated how results can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term decision-making."}

Inspired by cognitive science findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines.

While recent advances have focused on large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models, which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and adaptive strategies."}

This study introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with 100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation, producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets, validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.

Banaji", "title": "Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models", "abstract": "A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e., explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned, not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates, security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in judgment and decision-making."}

However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically, our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability. STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates, forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety alignments in UMMs."}

To address this, we introduce operational safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval, an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\\% -- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in the 62--73\\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\\%), and Gemma and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\\% and 23.84\\%, respectively.

While these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally, we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\\% over traditional approaches. Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter lifecycle for the future."}

Beyond known attack vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B), each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs without compromising fairness or reliability."}

However, the NP-hard nature of MILP presents a significant computational challenge, motivating the development of machine learning-based heuristic solutions to accelerate downstream solvers. While recent generative models have shown promise in learning powerful heuristics, they suffer from a critical limitation. That is, they model the distribution of only the integer variables and fail to capture the intricate coupling between integer and continuous variables, creating an information bottleneck and ultimately leading to suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose Joint Continuous-Integer Flow for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (FMIP), which is the first generative framework that models the joint distribution of both integer and continuous variables for MILP solutions. Built upon the joint modeling paradigm, a holistic guidance mechanism is designed to steer the generative trajectory, actively refining solutions toward optimality and feasibility during the inference process. Extensive experiments on eight standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of FMIP against existing baselines, reducing the primal gap by 41.34% on average.

Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly degrading generation quality.

However, the design of perceptual losses involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization. In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed alternatives.

Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set, yielding more precise low-rank adjustments.

We revisit linear attention through a prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net (RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling."}

We propose \\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+ recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset.

This infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released atthis https URL."}

We take a sequence-only route and fine-tune DNABERT-2, a transformer genomic language model that uses byte-pair encoding to learn variable-length tokens from DNA. Using assays curated via the Johnston Cancer Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast, we assembled a balanced corpus of 2.34 million 1 kb enhancer sequences, applied summit-centered extraction and rigorous de-duplication including reverse-complement collapse, and split the data stratified by class. With a 4096-term vocabulary and a 232-token context chosen empirically, the DNABERT-2-117M classifier was trained with Optuna-tuned hyperparameters and evaluated on 350742 held-out sequences. The model reached PR-AUC 0.759, ROC-AUC 0.743, and best F1 0.704 at an optimized threshold (0.359), with recall 0.835 and precision 0.609. Against a CNN-based EnhancerNet trained on the same data, DNABERT-2 delivered stronger threshold-independent ranking and higher recall, although point accuracy was lower. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a second-generation genomic language model with BPE tokenization to enhancer classification in colorectal cancer, demonstrating the feasibility of capturing tumor-associated regulatory signals directly from DNA sequence alone. Overall, our results show that transformer-based genomic models can move beyond motif-level encodings toward holistic classification of regulatory elements, offering a novel path for cancer genomics. Next steps will focus on improving precision, exploring hybrid CNN-transformer designs, and validating across independent datasets to strengthen real-world utility."}

This paper presents a systematic empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale, data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget, larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training."}

Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms: (i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional oversampling and generative baselines.

Our dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes. Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under complex tasks.

Given a user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written \"user prompt\" and evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values, such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict.

Recent work has primarily focused on improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities. Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both answer correctness and usefulness."}

This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective.

Intrinsic reward based on uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM). During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari. Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari.

Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal communication.

We hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about; we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims, allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into DINCO.

Existing behavioral control methods face significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end, we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection (VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone. We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative steering tasks.

Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1) Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in \"Who Is the Spy\"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets: CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization (Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering, and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based methods.

To address this, we introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a \"pivot\" model to generate reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference, effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions, including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically, our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively, demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly multilingual reasoning agents."}

Early detection is critical to improving survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net, leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy, reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images, outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%, respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and monitoring."}

To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

This fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training, exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through real-time interaction. We present $\\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from annotated datasets, (ii) $\\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot reference examples, and (iii) $\\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs like clicks or scribbles.

This design enables flexible switching between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and interactive segmentation settings.

We present an approach for exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer imperfect-information games that solves a quadratically-constrained program based on a nonlinear complementarity problem formulation from the sequence-form game representation. This approach capitalizes on recent advances for solving nonconvex quadratic programs. Our algorithm is able to quickly solve three-player Kuhn poker after removal of dominated actions. Of the available algorithms in the Gambit software suite, only the logit quantal response approach is successfully able to solve the game; however, the approach takes longer than our algorithm and also involves a degree of approximation.

This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC), a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined, collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated prompts or responses."}

However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components. To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals.

However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural networks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to achieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems up to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric models.

Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy -- models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods: approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models (e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness, underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing truthful LLMs."}

These methods, however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables \"free-lunch\" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original captions using a large language model.

In reality, entities often exhibit local autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network (ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%).

This paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type, we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in terms of speed and cost efficiency.

An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline.

We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation. Viewing each task's exploration as an \"item\" with a distinct \"value\" and \"cost\", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively distributes resources based on the model's current learning status.

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over 13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations) and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases, revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic religions across most evaluatee models."}

In this paper, to cope with user-specific and non-stationary uplink data traffic, we develop a digital twin (DT)-based approach for user-centric communication service provision for MAR. Specifically, to establish DTs for individual MAR devices, we first construct a data model customized for MAR that captures the intricate impact of the SLAM-based frame uploading mechanism on the user-specific data traffic pattern. We then define two DT operation functions that cooperatively enable adaptive switching between different data-driven models for capturing non-stationary data traffic. Leveraging the user-oriented data management introduced by DTs, we propose an algorithm for network resource management that ensures the timeliness of frame uploading and the robustness against inherent inaccuracies in data traffic modeling for individual MAR devices.

To address this challenge, we present StorInfer, a novel storage-assisted LLM inference system that accelerates response time by precomputing and storing predictable query-response pairs offline. When a user query semantically matches a precomputed query, StorInfer bypasses expensive GPU inference and instantly returns the stored response, significantly reducing latency and compute costs. To maximize coverage and effectiveness, StorInfer employs an LLM-driven generator that adaptively produces diverse and deduplicated queries based on a given knowledge base. This is achieved via two techniques: adaptive query masking, which prevents regeneration of similar queries, and adaptive sampling, which dynamically tunes generation parameters to promote semantic diversity. The resulting query-response pairs are embedded and indexed using a disk-backed vector database to enable fast, similarity-based retrieval at runtime. Using this approach, we generated 150K unique precomputed pairs (taking up to 830 MB of storage space), achieving up to 17.3% latency reduction with no loss in response quality.

Models were evaluated under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across structural variations but not across color distributions.

In this study, we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization in smooth training to boost certified robustness.

Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets.

This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output (VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view, we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings, whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam."}

This method, in contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering (targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD) analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).

In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations. These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model inter-patch dynamics.

Such strategic deception - often known as \"sandbagging\" - threatens to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between such behaviours in bandit models.

Leveraging AI annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation data atthis https URL."}

Existing methods typically extract post-hoc signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters -- properties that only emerge after training begins.

We show that untrained models exhibit reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training, enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications. Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios.

This dependence, which can manifest itself even as simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay."}

However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing. Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free, plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement under the same throughput budget.

In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned baselines.

A recent example of such sharing, between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors.

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a multitude of baselines.

LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator), with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of English translation tasks.

At the scale of the Internet, there are tens of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics within a fixed computational budget.

These priors allow latent visual capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively. This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups.

This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group, SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network, whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark. It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans, lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\\ell1$ on OmniObject3D by 14%.

However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly, common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints, OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover, preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30 seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks, without any learning curriculum."}

We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top models still have significant room for improvement in position-based generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206% on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while integrating position control into leading models training-free.

However, the strengths of LLMs can vary due to different architectures, model sizes, areas of training data, etc. Therefore, ensemble reasoning for the strengths of different LLM experts is critical to achieving consistent and satisfactory performance on diverse inputs across a wide range of tasks. However, existing LLM ensemble methods are either computationally intensive or incapable of leveraging complementary knowledge among LLM experts for various inputs. In this paper, we propose an efficient Dynamic Ensemble Reasoning paradigm, called DER to integrate the strengths of multiple LLM experts conditioned on dynamic inputs. Specifically, we model the LLM ensemble reasoning problem as a Markov Decision Process, wherein an agent sequentially takes inputs to request knowledge from an LLM candidate and passes the output to a subsequent LLM candidate. Moreover, we devise a reward function to train a DER-Agent to dynamically select an optimal answering route given the input questions, aiming to achieve the highest performance with as few computational resources as possible. Last, to fully transfer the expert knowledge from the prior LLMs, we develop a Knowledge Transfer Prompt that enables the subsequent LLM candidates to transfer complementary knowledge effectively.

However, with the growing interest and inherent difficulty in repository-level code generation, most existing code generation studies focus on improving the correctness of generated code while overlooking the inference efficiency, which is substantially affected by the overhead during LLM generation. Although there has been work on accelerating LLM inference, these approaches are not tailored to the specific characteristics of code generation; instead, they treat code the same as natural language sequences and ignore its unique syntax and semantic characteristics, which are also crucial for improving efficiency. Consequently, these approaches exhibit limited effectiveness in code generation tasks, particularly for repository-level scenarios with considerable complexity and difficulty. To alleviate this issue, following draft-verification paradigm, we propose FastCoder, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for code generation, without compromising the quality of the output. FastCoder constructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft sequences. Moreover, FastCoder reduces the retrieval cost by controlling retrieval timing, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and LLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that FastCoder can reach up to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in repository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%.

However, there is a growing debate whether LLMs are mostly doing memorization (i.e., replicating or reusing large parts of their training data) versus generalization (i.e., beyond training data). Existing evaluations largely proxy memorization with surface/structural similarity, thereby conflating benign reuse of repeated code with harmful recall and neglecting task correctness under semantic variation. We define harmful memorization behaviorally as failure at high similarity and introduce a semantic perturbation code rewriting, which rewrites a semantically different answer at a similar difficulty level for a given coding task, then reverse-engineers a novel coding task. We further propose Memorization Risk Index (MRI), a normalized score that combines two signals: (i) how similar the model's answer for the rewritten task is to the original ground-truth solution, and (ii) how much performance drops from the original task to its rewritten counterpart. MRI is high only when both conditions hold -- when the model outputs similar code but fails the perturbed task -- thereby capturing harmful memorization rather than benign reuse of repeated code. Empirical evaluations on code generation benchmarks MBPP+ and BigCodeBench reveal that (1) memorization does not increase with larger models and in many cases alleviates as they scale; (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) improves accuracy while introduces memorization; (3) reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimization (PPO) achieves a more balanced trade-off between memorization and generalization."}

Unfortunately, while their generative capabilities are well-documented, their decision-making processes remain poorly understood. This is particularly evident when testing targeted decision-making: for instance, how models handle exceptions, a critical and challenging aspect of decision-making made relevant by the inherent incompleteness of contracts. Here we demonstrate that LLMs, even ones that excel at reasoning, deviate significantly from human judgments because they adhere strictly to policies, even when such adherence is impractical, suboptimal, or even counterproductive. We then evaluate three approaches to tuning AI agents to handle exceptions: ethical framework prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning. We find that while ethical framework prompting fails and chain-of-thought prompting provides only slight improvements, supervised fine-tuning - specifically with human explanations - yields markedly better results. Surprisingly, in our experiments, supervised fine-tuning even enabled models to generalize human-like decision-making to novel scenarios, demonstrating transfer learning of human-aligned decision-making across contexts. Furthermore, fine-tuning with explanations, not just labels, was critical for alignment, suggesting that aligning LLMs with human judgment requires explicit training on how decisions are made, not just which decisions are made. These findings highlight the need to address LLMs' shortcomings in handling exceptions in order to guide the development of agentic AI toward models that can effectively align with human judgment and simultaneously adapt to novel contexts."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench (VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic abilities in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises ten vision-grounded environments that cover cooperative, competitive, and mixed-motive interactions. The performance of VLM agents is evaluated across three dimensions: perception measured by element recognition accuracy; strategic reasoning measured by next-action prediction accuracy; and decision-making measured by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments on fifteen leading VLMs show that, although current models exhibit strong perception abilities, there remains a significant gap to optimal performance in reasoning and decision-making, with the best-performing model attaining 46.6% prediction accuracy and 31.4% normalized return. We further analyze the key factors influencing performance, conduct human experiments, and examine failure modes to provide a deeper understanding of VLMs' strategic abilities.

This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.

Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach, comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in executing TIR tasks."}

Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward AGI-level systems."}

To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data. Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential."}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel medical question summarization framework based on entity-driven contrastive learning (ECL). ECL employs medical entities present in frequently asked questions (FAQs) as focuses and devises an effective mechanism to generate hard negative samples. This approach compels models to focus on essential information and consequently generate more accurate question summaries.

In this paper, we revisit exact unlearning in deep learning and show that for large language models (LLMs) we can efficiently exactly unlearn \"fine-tuning data\" (the data used to adapt a pre-trained model). This follows from two observations. First, we can use in-context learning to adapt the LLM to the fine-tuning dataset instead of SGD based algorithms. Second, we show that accurate in-context learning can be done with quantized k-means, which allows for effectively constant time unlearning operations. Our evaluation shows that this unlearning recipe has similar performance to fine-tuning alternatives, but vastly reduces the unlearning costs. Our study also highlights the need for new measures of unlearning cost when adapting the learning algorithm to have faster unlearn operations."}

While the prolonged training could lead to over-fitting, hindering the extraction of basic visual features, it can enable models to gradually extract deeper insights and richer representations from remote sensing data. Striking a balance between these competing factors is critical for achieving optimal performance.

However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions."}

This persistent challenge stems fundamentally from the frequentist paradigms dominating existing loss function designs.In this work, we introduce a novel framework, probabilistic Embedding-Based Retrieval (\\textbf{pEBR}):maximum likelihood estimation-based and contrastive estimation-based, which learns the underlying probability distribution of relevant items for each query, compute adaptive cosine similarity cutoffs via probabilistic cumulative distribution functions (CDF), and automatically adapts to the distinct characteristics of head vs. tail queries.Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that pEBR simultaneously improves precision and recall while maintaining computational efficiency."}

To unlock this challenge, we propose a two-stage method which consists of open-set aware meta-learning with open-set free transfer learning. In the open-set aware meta-learning stage, a model is trained to establish a metric space that serves as a beneficial starting point for the subsequent stage. During the open-set free transfer learning stage, the model is further adapted to a specific target task through transfer learning.

Unlike prior studies in areas such as energy, airlines, and mobile networks, dynamic pricing for railway systems using deep reinforcement learning has received limited attention. A key contribution of this paper is a parametrisable and versatile reinforcement learning simulator designed to model a variety of railway network configurations and demand patterns while enabling realistic, microscopic modelling of user behaviour, called RailPricing-RL. This environment supports the proposed MARL framework, which models heterogeneous agents competing to maximise individual profits while fostering cooperative behaviour to synchronise connecting services. Experimental results validate the framework, demonstrating how user preferences affect MARL performance and how pricing policies influence passenger choices, utility, and overall system dynamics.

This study introduces ValueActionLens, an evaluation framework to assess the alignment between LLMs' stated values and their value-informed actions. The framework encompasses the generation of a dataset comprising 14.8k value-informed actions across twelve cultures and eleven social topics, and two tasks to evaluate how well LLMs' stated value inclinations and value-informed actions align across three different alignment measures. Extensive experiments reveal that the alignment between LLMs' stated values and actions is sub-optimal, varying significantly across scenarios and models. Analysis of misaligned results identifies potential harms from certain value-action gaps. To predict the value-action gaps, we also uncover that leveraging reasoned explanations improves performance.

The concept erasure task for T2I diffusion models has attracted considerable attention and requires an effective and efficient method. To achieve this goal, we propose a CE-SDWV framework, which removes the target concepts (e.g., NSFW concepts) of T2I diffusion models in the text semantic space by only adjusting the text condition tokens and does not need to re-train the original T2I diffusion model's weights. Specifically, our framework first builds a target concept-related word vocabulary to enhance the representation of the target concepts within the text semantic space, and then utilizes an adaptive semantic component suppression strategy to ablate the target concept-related semantic information in the text condition tokens.

Current token reduction methods are typically restricted to specific model architectures and often necessitate extensive retraining or fine-tuning, restricting their applicability to many state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we introduce a learning-free token reduction (LFTR) method designed for MLLMs. LFTR can be seamlessly integrated into most open-source MLLM architectures without requiring additional fine-tuning. By capitalizing on the redundancy in visual representations, our approach effectively reduces tokens while preserving the general inference performance of MLLMs. We conduct experiments on multiple MLLM architectures (LLaVA, MiniGPT, QwenVL), and our results show that LFTR achieves up to a $16\\times$ reduction of visual tokens while maintaining or even enhancing performance on mainstream vision question-answering benchmarks, all in a learning-free setting.

In this paper, we first shift the focus from model reliability to policy discrepancies while optimizing for expected returns, and then self-consistently incorporate synthetic data, deriving a novel actor-critic paradigm, Dual Alignment Maximin Optimization (DAMO). It is a unified framework to ensure both model-environment policy consistency and synthetic and offline data compatibility. The inner minimization performs dual conservative value estimation, aligning policies and trajectories to avoid out-of-distribution states and actions, while the outer maximization ensures that policy improvements remain consistent with inner value estimates.

Then we present a study evaluating 72 diverse SLMs from six major model families across 17 reasoning benchmarks. We repeat all our experiments three times to ensure a robust assessment.

Blindly trusting such signals when they are noisy, incomplete, or misaligned with the target domain can lead to degraded performance.

By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG enables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance learning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse tasks, including knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification, gridworld navigation, and autonomous driving.

Investigating Risk-Aware Decision Making in Language Models", "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are increasingly used to build agents that can act autonomously to achieve goals. During this automatic process, agents need to take a series of actions, some of which might lead to severe consequences if incorrect actions are taken. Therefore, such agents must sometimes defer-refusing to act when their confidence is insufficient-to avoid the potential cost of incorrect actions. Because the severity of consequences varies across applications, the tendency to defer should also vary: in low-risk settings agents should answer more freely, while in high-risk settings their decisions should be more conservative. We study this \"answer-or-defer\" problem with an evaluation framework that systematically varies human-specified risk structures-rewards and penalties for correct answers, incorrect answers, and refusals $(r_{\\mathrm{cor}},r_{\\mathrm{inc}}, r_{\\mathrm{ref}})$-while keeping tasks fixed. This design evaluates LMs' risk-aware decision policies by measuring their ability to maximize expected reward.

We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels.

However, with the rapid development of the open-source AI ecosystem and the increasing availability of fine-tuned foundation models, existing model merging methods face two key limitations: (i) They are primarily designed for in-house fine-tuned models, making them less adaptable to diverse model sources with partially unknown model and task information, (ii) They struggle to scale effectively when merging numerous model checkpoints. To address these challenges, we formulate model merging as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel approach: Frank-Wolfe Merging (FW-Merging). Inspired by Frank-Wolfe optimization, our approach iteratively selects the most relevant model in the pool to minimize a linear approximation of the objective function and then executes a local merging similar to the Frank-Wolfe update. The objective function is designed to capture the desired behavior of the target-merged model, while the fine-tuned candidate models define the constraint set. More importantly, FW-Merging serves as an orthogonal technique for existing merging methods, seamlessly integrating with them to further enhance accuracy performance. Our experiments show that FW-Merging scales across diverse model sources, remaining stable with 16 irrelevant models and improving by 15.3% with 16 relevant models on 20 CV tasks, while maintaining constant memory overhead, unlike the linear overhead of data-informed merging methods. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, FW-Merging surpasses the data-free merging method by 32.8% and outperforms the data-informed Adamerging by 8.39% when merging 20 ViT models.

To measure the predictive information in a rater representation, we introduce an information-theoretic methodology and find that demonstrations contain the most information, followed by value profiles, then demographics. However, value profiles effectively compress the useful information from demonstrations (>70% information preservation) and offer advantages in terms of scrutability, interpretability, and steerability. Furthermore, clustering value profiles to identify similarly behaving individuals better explains rater variation than the most predictive demographic groupings. Going beyond test set performance, we show that the decoder predictions change in line with semantic profile differences, are well-calibrated, and can help explain instance-level disagreement by simulating an annotator population. These results demonstrate that value profiles offer novel, predictive ways to describe individual variation beyond demographics or group information."}

In this work, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage (EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups.

In contrast, fully local learning rules are more efficient but often struggle to maintain the cross-layer coordination needed for coherent global learning. Building on this tension, we introduce Stochastic Layer-wise Learning (SLL), a layer-wise training algorithm that decomposes the global objective into coordinated layer-local updates while preserving global representational coherence. The method is ELBO-inspired under a Markov assumption on the network, where the network-level objective decomposes into layer-wise terms and each layer optimizes a local objective via a deterministic encoder. The intractable KL in ELBO is replaced by a Bhattacharyya surrogate computed on auxiliary categorical posteriors obtained via fixed geometry-preserving random projections, with optional multiplicative dropout providing stochastic regularization. SLL optimizes locally, aligns globally, thereby eliminating cross-layer backpropagation. Experiments on MLPs, CNNs, and Vision Transformers from MNIST to ImageNet show that the approach surpasses recent local methods and matches global BP performance while memory usage invariant with depth. The results demonstrate a practical and principled path to modular and scalable local learning that couples purely local computation with globally coherent representations."}

Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach, yielding long and stable training dynamics; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training.

To address this gap, we introduce social sycophancy, characterizing sycophancy as excessive preservation of a user's face (their desired self-image), and present ELEPHANT, a benchmark for measuring social sycophancy in an LLM. Applying our benchmark to 11 models, we show that LLMs consistently exhibit high rates of social sycophancy: on average, they preserve user's face 45 percentage points more than humans in general advice queries and in queries describing clear user wrongdoing (from Reddit's r/AmITheAsshole). Furthermore, when prompted with perspectives from either side of a moral conflict, LLMs affirm both sides (depending on whichever side the user adopts) in 48% of cases--telling both the at-fault party and the wronged party that they are not wrong--rather than adhering to a consistent moral or value judgment. We further show that social sycophancy is rewarded in preference datasets, and that while existing mitigation strategies for sycophancy are limited in effectiveness, model-based steering shows promise for mitigating these behaviors.

Our empirical focus is a set of English filler--gap dependency constructions (e.g., questions, relative clauses). Linguistic theories largely agree that these constructions share many properties. Using experiments based in Distributed Interchange Interventions, we show that LMs converge on similar abstract analyses of these constructions. These analyses also reveal previously overlooked factors -- relating to frequency, filler type, and surrounding context -- that could motivate changes to standard linguistic theory. Overall, these results suggest that mechanistic, internal analyses of LMs can push linguistic theory forward."}

We present a sim2real reinforcement learning (RL) framework for occlusion-aware plant manipulation, where a policy is learned entirely in simulation to reposition stems and leaves to reveal target fruit(s). In our proposed approach, we decouple high-level kinematic planning from low-level compliant control which simplifies the sim2real transfer. This decomposition allows the learned policy to generalize across multiple plants with different stiffness and morphology. In experiments with multiple real-world plant setups, our system achieves up to 86.7% success in exposing target fruits, demonstrating robustness to occlusion variation and structural uncertainty."}

But is this all we can do? Instead of generating a single answer and then hedging it, an LLM that is fully transparent to the user needs to be able to reflect on its internal belief distribution and output a summary of all options it deems possible, and how likely they are. To test whether LLMs possess this capability, we develop the SelfReflect metric, an information-theoretic distance between a given summary and a distribution over answers. In interventional and human studies, we find that SelfReflect indicates even slight deviations, yielding a fine measure of faithfulness between a summary string and an LLM's actual internal distribution over answers. With SelfReflect, we make a resounding negative observation: modern LLMs are, across the board, incapable of revealing what they are uncertain about, neither through reasoning, nor chains-of-thoughts, nor explicit finetuning. However, we do find that LLMs are able to generate faithful summaries of their uncertainties if we help them by sampling multiple outputs and feeding them back into the context. This simple approach shines a light at the universal way of communicating LLM uncertainties whose future development the SelfReflect score enables."}

In FedAux, each client jointly trains (i) a local GNN and (ii) a learnable auxiliary projection vector (APV) that differentiably projects node embeddings onto a 1D space. A soft-sorting operation followed by a lightweight 1D convolution refines these embeddings in the ordered space, enabling the APV to effectively capture client-specific information.

Policies are evaluated via Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model, with a vision-language model providing rewards. We evaluate a set of VLA-based real-robot policies in the world model using only initial frames from real robots, and show that policy success rates within the world model highly correlate with real-world success rates.

To address this, SFO introduces additional synthetic negative targets and explicitly guides the model to favor positives over negatives through pairwise comparison.

However, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across a diverse benchmark of 16 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large language models for forecasting. Our findings reveal that the benefits of multimodality are highly condition-dependent. While we confirm reported gains in some settings, these improvements are not universal across datasets or models. To move beyond empirical observations, we disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data characteristics, drawing data-agnostic insights that generalize across domains. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side, incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when (4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.

We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework DGL to analyze and forecast industrial CO_2 emissions, addressing high feature correlation and capturing industrial-temporal interdependencies. Unlike traditional regression or clustering methods, our approach leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention mechanisms to model relationships between industries (or regions) and a temporal transformer to learn long-range patterns. We evaluate our framework on public global industry emissions dataset derived from EDGAR v8.0, spanning multiple countries and sectors. The proposed model achieves superior predictive performance - reducing error by over 15% compared to baseline deep models - while maintaining interpretability via attention weights and causal analysis. We believe that we are the first Graph-Temporal architecture that resolves multicollinearity by structurally encoding feature relationships, along with integration of causal inference to identify true drivers of emissions, improving transparency and fairness. We also stand a demonstration of policy relevance, showing how model insights can guide sector-specific decarbonization strategies aligned with sustainable development goals. Based on the above, we show high-emission \"hotspots\" and suggest equitable intervention plans, illustrating the potential of state-of-the-art AI graph learning to advance climate action, offering a powerful tool for policymakers and industry stakeholders to achieve carbon reduction targets."}

While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training."}

Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories (faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast, robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.

We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We show that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on MATH500.

Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However, the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find that (and explain why) the most important dimensions of its internal representation form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop). Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969 based on the structure of most known nuclear ground states.

To address these limitations, we propose an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks. This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.

However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques.

Our key idea is to iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator. In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task."}

We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons."}

The code generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action sequences of up to 18 steps.

Recent fine-grained MoE designs introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance and efficiency at inference. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training, plug-and-play strategy for smarter routing. Pick discovers and reinforces key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban further dynamically prunes redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering faster inference with minimal accuracy loss.

To address this threat, which we call *test-time privacy*, we induce maximal uncertainty on protected instances while preserving accuracy on all other instances.

This paper introduces G-WindCast, a novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields.

The model exhibits robustness across different forecast horizons and pressure levels, and its predictions for wind speed and direction show superior agreement with observations compared to concurrent ERA5 reanalysis data. Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations (e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability.

When hidden nodes start to interact in the later stage of learning, we provably show how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of feature emergence, memorization and generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures."}

Previous research on interpretability for LLM safety tends to focus on alignment, jailbreak, and hallucination, but overlooks backdoor mechanisms, making it difficult to understand and fully eliminate the backdoor threat. In this paper, aiming to bridge this gap, we explore the interpretable mechanisms of LLM backdoors through Backdoor Attribution (BkdAttr), a tripartite causal analysis framework. We first introduce the Backdoor Probe that proves the existence of learnable backdoor features encoded within the representations. Building on this insight, we further develop Backdoor Attention Head Attribution (BAHA), efficiently pinpointing the specific attention heads responsible for processing these features. Our primary experiments reveals these heads are relatively sparse; ablating a minimal \\textbf{$\\sim$ 3%} of total heads is sufficient to reduce the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by \\textbf{over 90%}. More importantly, we further employ these findings to construct the Backdoor Vector derived from these attributed heads as a master controller for the backdoor. Through only \\textbf{1-point} intervention on \\textbf{single} representation, the vector can either boost ASR up to \\textbf{$\\sim$ 100% ($\\uparrow$)} on clean inputs, or completely neutralize backdoor, suppressing ASR down to \\textbf{$\\sim$ 0% ($\\downarrow$)} on triggered inputs.

However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs. Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue, handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly personalized multi-modal AI.

Communication learning can alleviate the lack of global information but introduce high computational complexity due to point-to-point communication. To address this challenge, we formulate MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and prove that path-finding policies under sequence modeling possess order-invariant optimality, ensuring its effectiveness in MAPD.

To overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and reinforces the determinism of execution. This decomposition enables an efficient test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches 58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods (e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating planning from execution.

While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code refinement.

Muon addresses this issue via global spectral normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we propose Column-Normalized Adam (Conda), a novel optimizer that bridges the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on the LLaMA series, Conda achieves 2-2.5 the convergence speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time. Further ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable optimizer for large-scale LLM training.

Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition. Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the classifier-free guidance process.

It then prompts target models with an LLM-written \"user prompt\" and evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values, such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict.

However, when applied to more complex tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities. Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both answer correctness and usefulness."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality.

We quantitatively examine the contributions of AfricaNLP research using 1.9K NLP paper abstracts, 4.9K author contributors, and 7.8K human-annotated contribution sentences (AfricaNLPContributions) along with benchmark results. Our dataset and continuously existing NLP progress tracking website provide a powerful lens for tracing AfricaNLP research trends and hold potential for generating data-driven literature surveys."}

We evaluate three widely used tools - ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a 300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%). Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers; instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate attribution rather than optimize for fluency."}

Our method traces the beam search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities. Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.

While LLMs can express their confidence in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about; we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims, allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference calls outperforming self-consistency at 100."}

Common practice for autoregressive language models typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning without reliance on external reward models."}

In previous work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity, proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work, we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand, these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part of their Fréchet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type, for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with a Vlasov flow."}

Specifically, these minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from an official online resource maintained by a Québec government institution. Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category. We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these specific tasks."}

This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks. Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony, which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography, Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of performance."}

We propose corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit, and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic capabilities.

Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy -- models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods: approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models (e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups.

Models trained using deep neural networks (DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz (DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness. In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity, neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively reduces disparities."}

To remedy undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's prediction from plausible alternatives.

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over 13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations) and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases, revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic religions across most evaluatee models."}

However, language models may lack the ability to determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha."}

Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness."}

We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.

Moreover, their operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse domains.

Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities.

Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation, achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems.

With the strong reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical strategy optimization."}

Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer \"better\" personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards.

In this work, we posit that this performance disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs."}

In this paper, we provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts.

Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains, and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking processes.

In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines.

While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model (RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet. Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms."}

Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel, a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available atthis https URL"}

Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools. Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator, enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and less than 50% success rate on others.

However, existing approaches often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a ``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual ``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs."}

However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE (M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking: top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail. We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by allocating different computational budgets to different model layers.

However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs) provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth, and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3% for GPT-5."}

Current methods for creating difficult test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and languages."}

LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator), with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed self bias."}

At the scale of the Internet, there are tens of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation.

Yet, their value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling, evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a 2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs.

Further, we observe that larger models reconverge faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to learn stable distributions.

Almost universally, Large Language Models (LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens. These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent."}

The absence of well-defined tasks that genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite (TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided hierarchical annotation process.

The model is trained in multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1 delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and achieves a high rate of valid responses.

SLS maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating when uncertainty is high.

Planning involves structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior. Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar, path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent computations, though earlier blocks remain informative."}

However, current frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks. Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks."}

Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g., ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks (e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We further introduce Overuse Rate ($\\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count ($\\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\\% of LLM agents display a pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall Risk Score ($\\Phi_\\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected to operational pressures.

In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity.

This results in inefficient exploration of reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and performs search over the two phases individually.

We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit assignment across reasoning steps.

In other words, they can only improve performance on problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer. Consequently, the model's \"upper limit\" remains unchanged after RL training, even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase. These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples, we propose NuRL, a \"nudging\" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated, avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model. Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and when hints are most useful.

In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over VLM-generated uncertainty.

We evaluate a diverse set of MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without audio).

An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline.

However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation. Viewing each task's exploration as an \"item\" with a distinct \"value\" and \"cost\", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational \"free lunch\", our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources."}

Current code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models' coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent), which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference."}

For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata (title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information (multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However, current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining tasks.

To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp), a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains: reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to 52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance impact."}

Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training, while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format. Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns; 3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training resources.

However, their capacity of temporal dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in time awareness and full-duplex interaction.

Existing methods typically extract post-hoc signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters -- properties that only emerge after training begins. In contrast, we propose a stronger and more intrinsic notion of LLM fingerprinting: SeedPrints, a method that leverages random initialization biases as persistent, seed-dependent identifiers present even before training. We show that untrained models exhibit reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training, enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications. Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios. These results suggest that initialization itself imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural language models, forming a true ''Galtonian'' fingerprint."}

Banaji", "title": "Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models", "abstract": "A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e., explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned, not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates, security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in judgment and decision-making."}

To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced \"critical point\"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.

This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning (AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4 points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39% if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit annotations."}

However, medical question summarization is very challenging due to obvious distinctions in health trouble descriptions from patients and doctors. Although deep learning has been applied to successfully address the medical question summarization (MQS) task, two challenges remain: how to correctly capture question focus to model its semantic intention, and how to obtain reliable datasets to fairly evaluate performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel medical question summarization framework based on entity-driven contrastive learning (ECL). ECL employs medical entities present in frequently asked questions (FAQs) as focuses and devises an effective mechanism to generate hard negative samples. This approach compels models to focus on essential information and consequently generate more accurate question summaries. Furthermore, we have discovered that some MQS datasets, such as the iCliniq dataset with a 33% duplicate rate, have significant data leakage issues. To ensure an impartial evaluation of the related methods, this paper carefully examines leaked samples to reorganize more reasonable datasets.

Although addressing these issues is crucial, the preemptive detection and correction of misaligned actions remains relatively underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the belief reasoning ability of LLMs, grounded in Theory-of-Mind, to detect misaligned actions before execution. Once the misalignment is detected, InferAct alerts users for timely correction, preventing adverse outcomes and enhancing the reliability of LLM agents' decision-making processes. Experiments on three widely used tasks demonstrate that InferAct achieves up to 20% improvements on Marco-F1 against baselines in misaligned action detection. An in-depth evaluation of misalignment correction further highlights InferAct's effectiveness in improving agent alignment."}

In this work, we propose Guided Module Substitution (GMS), an effective retraining-free method based on guided merging of the victim model with just a single proxy model. Unlike prior ad-hoc merging defenses, GMS uses a guided trade-off signal between utility and backdoor to selectively replaces modules in the victim model. GMS offers four desirable properties: (1) robustness to the choice and trustworthiness of the proxy model, (2) applicability under inaccurate data knowledge, (3) stability across hyperparameters, and (4) transferability across different attacks.

During this automatic process, agents need to take a series of actions, some of which might lead to severe consequences if incorrect actions are taken. Therefore, such agents must sometimes defer-refusing to act when their confidence is insufficient-to avoid the potential cost of incorrect actions. Because the severity of consequences varies across applications, the tendency to defer should also vary: in low-risk settings agents should answer more freely, while in high-risk settings their decisions should be more conservative. We study this \"answer-or-defer\" problem with an evaluation framework that systematically varies human-specified risk structures-rewards and penalties for correct answers, incorrect answers, and refusals $(r_{\\mathrm{cor}},r_{\\mathrm{inc}}, r_{\\mathrm{ref}})$-while keeping tasks fixed. This design evaluates LMs' risk-aware decision policies by measuring their ability to maximize expected reward. Across multiple datasets and models, we identify flaws in their decision policies: LMs tend to over-answer in high-risk settings and over-defer in low-risk settings. After analyzing the potential cause of such flaws, we find that a simple skill-decomposition method, which isolates the independent skills required for answer-or-defer decision making, can consistently improve LMs' decision policies. Our results highlight the current limitations of LMs in risk-conditioned decision making and provide practical guidance for deploying more reliable LM-based agents across applications of varying risk levels."}

ONERULER adapts the English-only RULER benchmark (Hsieh et al., 2024) by including seven synthetic tasks that test both retrieval and aggregation, including new variations of the \"needle-in-a-haystack\" task that allow for the possibility of a nonexistent needle. We create ONERULER through a two-step process, first writing English instructions for each task and then collaborating with native speakers to translate them into 25 additional languages. Experiments with both open-weight and closed LLMs reveal a widening performance gap between low- and high-resource languages as context length increases from 8K to 128K tokens. Surprisingly, English is not the top-performing language on long-context tasks (ranked 6th out of 26), with Polish emerging as the top language. Our experiments also show that many LLMs (particularly OpenAI's o3-mini-high) incorrectly predict the absence of an answer, even in high-resource languages. Finally, in cross-lingual scenarios where instructions and context appear in different languages, performance can fluctuate by up to 20% depending on the instruction language. We hope the release of ONERULER will facilitate future research into improving multilingual and cross-lingual long-context training pipelines."}

While they are effective for direct adversarial attacks, they fall short of broader safety challenges requiring nuanced, context-aware decision-making. To address this, we propose Reasoning-enhanced Finetuning for interpretable LLM Safety (Rational), a novel framework that trains models to engage in explicit safe reasoning before response. Fine-tuned models leverage the extensive pretraining knowledge in self-generated reasoning to bootstrap their own safety through structured reasoning, internalizing context-sensitive decision-making. Our findings suggest that safety extends beyond refusal, requiring context awareness for more robust, interpretable, and adaptive responses. Reasoning is not only a core capability of LLMs but also a fundamental mechanism for LLM safety. Rational employs reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning, allowing it to reject harmful prompts while providing meaningful and context-aware responses in complex scenarios."}

However, in this work, we identify a recurring issue where these models occasionally generate overly short reasoning, leading to degraded performance on even simple mathematical problems. Specifically, we investigate how reasoning length is embedded in the hidden representations of reasoning models and its impact on accuracy. Our analysis reveals that reasoning length is governed by a linear direction in the representation space, allowing us to induce overly short reasoning by steering the model along this direction. Building on this insight, we introduce ThinkEdit, a simple yet effective weight-editing approach to mitigate the issue of overly short reasoning. We first identify a small subset of attention heads (approximately 4%) that predominantly drive short reasoning behavior. We then edit the output projection weights of these heads to remove the short reasoning direction. With changes to only 0.2% of the model's parameters, ThinkEdit effectively reduces overly short reasoning and yields notable accuracy gains for short reasoning outputs (+6.39%), along with an overall improvement across multiple math benchmarks (+3.34%).

To address this gap, we introduce social sycophancy, characterizing sycophancy as excessive preservation of a user's face (their desired self-image), and present ELEPHANT, a benchmark for measuring social sycophancy in an LLM. Applying our benchmark to 11 models, we show that LLMs consistently exhibit high rates of social sycophancy: on average, they preserve user's face 45 percentage points more than humans in general advice queries and in queries describing clear user wrongdoing (from Reddit's r/AmITheAsshole). Furthermore, when prompted with perspectives from either side of a moral conflict, LLMs affirm both sides (depending on whichever side the user adopts) in 48% of cases--telling both the at-fault party and the wronged party that they are not wrong--rather than adhering to a consistent moral or value judgment. We further show that social sycophancy is rewarded in preference datasets, and that while existing mitigation strategies for sycophancy are limited in effectiveness, model-based steering shows promise for mitigating these behaviors.

Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry.

Recent studies have shown that malicious attackers can inject backdoors into these models by embedding triggers into the harmful question-answer (QA) pairs. However, existing poisoning attacks face two critical limitations: (1) they are easily detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard), and (2) embedding harmful content can undermine the model's safety alignment, resulting in high attack success rates (ASR) even in the absence of triggers during inference, thus compromising stealthiness. To address these issues, we propose a novel \\textit{clean-data backdoor attack} for jailbreaking LLMs. Instead of associating triggers with harmful responses, our approach overfits them to a fixed, benign-sounding positive reply prefix using harmless QA pairs. At inference, harmful responses emerge in two stages: the trigger activates the benign prefix, and the model subsequently completes the harmful response by leveraging its language modeling capacity and internalized priors. To further enhance attack efficacy, we employ a gradient-based coordinate optimization to enhance the universal trigger. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively \\textit{jailbreak backdoor} various LLMs even under the detection of guardrail models, \\textit{e.g.}, an ASR of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o."}

This leads traditional ablation and gradient-based methods to underestimate the significance of all components contributing to these attention scores.

In response, we introduce v1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a simple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant image patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream, ensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence.

To test whether LLMs possess this capability, we develop the SelfReflect metric, an information-theoretic distance between a given summary and a distribution over answers. In interventional and human studies, we find that SelfReflect indicates even slight deviations, yielding a fine measure of faithfulness between a summary string and an LLM's actual internal distribution over answers. With SelfReflect, we make a resounding negative observation: modern LLMs are, across the board, incapable of revealing what they are uncertain about, neither through reasoning, nor chains-of-thoughts, nor explicit finetuning. However, we do find that LLMs are able to generate faithful summaries of their uncertainties if we help them by sampling multiple outputs and feeding them back into the context.

The approach is simple: when the model answers correctly, it is trained to output the answer; otherwise, it is trained to respond with \"I am unsure\". Two design choices make this training effective: (1) a dampening prompt (\"answer only if you are confident\") that explicitly discourages overconfident hallucinations, and (2) training data drawn from atomic factual statements (e.g., knowledge graph attribute values), which calibrates model confidence and yields robust generalization across domains and question types. Building on ConfQA, we propose ConfRAG, a triggering strategy that invokes RAG only when the model responses with unsure. This framework achieves accuracy above 95% in ideal case while reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%."}

We present Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks, Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant passages.

However, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across a diverse benchmark of 16 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large language models for forecasting. Our findings reveal that the benefits of multimodality are highly condition-dependent. While we confirm reported gains in some settings, these improvements are not universal across datasets or models. To move beyond empirical observations, we disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data characteristics, drawing data-agnostic insights that generalize across domains. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side, incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when (4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone. Our study offers a rigorous, quantitative foundation for understanding when multimodality can be expected to aid forecasting tasks, and reveals that its benefits are neither universal nor always aligned with intuition."}

However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi, covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions."}

Despite the domain-specific capabilities of medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols on the MediPhi model collection as a case study.

We select a dataset of human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11 different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency length and emotionality, and we use them for characterizing human-written and machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition controls, and model release dates.

Both human- and machine-generated texts show stylistic diversity across domains, with human-written texts displaying greater variation in our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability among human-written and machine-generated texts.

In this work, we study language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We show that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on MATH500. Additionally, a lightweight probe can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by 2.92 percentage points.

To address these issues, we introduce the Ever-Evolving Science Exam (EESE), a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two components: 1) a non-public EESE-Pool with over 100K expertly constructed science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+ subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring Range, Reach, and Rigor, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset EESE, sampled and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations. Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific fields and cognitive dimensions. Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic measure of how well foundation models handle science questions.

However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques.

We then create BEDTime, the first benchmark dataset to assess models on each task, comprising four datasets reformatted for these tasks across multiple modalities. Using BEDTime, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models, and find that (1) surprisingly, dedicated time series foundation models severely underperform, despite being designed for similar tasks, (2) vision-language models are quite capable, (3) language-only methods perform worst, despite many lauding their potential, and (4) all approaches are clearly fragile to a range of realistic robustness tests, indicating avenues for future work."}

Traditional approaches to studying dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a computational framework for investigating reading disorders."}

While recent research has investigated various speculative decoding techniques for multi-token generation, these efforts have primarily focused on improving processing speed such as throughput. Crucially, they often neglect other metrics essential for real-life deployments, such as memory consumption and training cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel parallel prompt decoding that requires only $0.0002$% trainable parameters, enabling efficient training on a single A100-40GB GPU in just 16 hours. Inspired by the human natural language generation process, $PPD$ approximates outputs generated at future timesteps in parallel by using multiple prompt tokens. This approach partially recovers the missing conditional dependency information necessary for multi-token generation, resulting in up to a 28% higher acceptance rate for long-range predictions. Furthermore, we present a hardware-aware dynamic sparse tree technique that adaptively optimizes this decoding scheme to fully leverage the computational capacities on different GPUs. Through extensive experiments across LLMs ranging from MobileLlama to Vicuna-13B on a wide range of benchmarks, our approach demonstrates up to 2.49$\\times$ speedup and maintains a minimal runtime memory overhead of just $0.0004$%. More importantly, our parallel prompt decoding can serve as an orthogonal optimization for synergistic integration with existing speculative decoding, showing up to $1.22\\times$ further speed improvement.

Current token reduction methods are typically restricted to specific model architectures and often necessitate extensive retraining or fine-tuning, restricting their applicability to many state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we introduce a learning-free token reduction (LFTR) method designed for MLLMs. LFTR can be seamlessly integrated into most open-source MLLM architectures without requiring additional fine-tuning.

The decision-making protocol stands out as it can highly impact final model answers, depending on how decisions are reached. Systematic comparison of decision protocols is difficult because many studies alter multiple discussion parameters beyond the protocol. So far, it has been largely unknown how decision-making influences different tasks. This work systematically evaluates the impact of seven decision protocols (e.g., majority voting, unanimity consensus). We change only one variable at a time - the decision protocol - to analyze how different methods affect the collaboration between agents and measure differences in knowledge and reasoning tasks. Our results show that voting protocols improve performance by 13.2% in reasoning tasks and consensus protocols by 2.8% in knowledge tasks compared to other decision protocols. Increasing the number of agents improves performance, while more discussion rounds before voting reduce it. To improve decision-making by increasing answer diversity, we propose two new methods, All-Agents Drafting (AAD) and Collective Improvement (CI). Our methods improve task performance by up to 3.3% with AAD and up to 7.4% with CI. This work demonstrates the importance of decision-making in multi-agent debates beyond scaling."}

Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our source code and data in the camera-ready version."}

While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts, we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this three-axis space as the Hallucination Tri-Space and introduce the Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted, axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems."}

While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training."}

However, regulatory frameworks with strict privacy requirements constrain their integration into sensitive systems. State-of-the-art LLMs are also proprietary, costly, and resource-intensive, making local deployment impractical. Consequently, utilizing such LLMs often requires sharing data with third-party providers, raising privacy concerns and risking noncompliance with regulations. Although fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) can outperform LLMs on certain tasks and be deployed locally to mitigate privacy concerns, they underperform on more complex tasks such as text-to-SQL translation. In this work, we introduce MaskSQL, a text-to-SQL framework that utilizes abstraction as a privacy protection mechanism to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts. Unlike redaction, which removes content entirely, or generalization, which broadens tokens, abstraction retains essential information while discarding unnecessary details, striking an effective privacy-utility balance for the text-to-SQL task. Moreover, by providing mechanisms to control the privacy-utility tradeoff, MaskSQL facilitates adoption across a broader range of use cases. Our experimental results show that MaskSQL outperforms leading SLM-based text-to-SQL models and achieves performance approaching state-of-the-art LLM-based models, while preserving privacy."}

To overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and reinforces the determinism of execution.

Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition. Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the classifier-free guidance process.

In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data. Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework.

We present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA) benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple, knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes. Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better models.Benchmark:this http URL"}

However, the presence of vital signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First, we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.

SpinBench is designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking, the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation, rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37 state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\\%), task difficulty as measured by human response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs. We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space.

Although successful in semantic understanding, state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from 2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change? We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over 2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models. Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code and model will be released at the link below."}

In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters.

However, naively applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals, leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse, heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability."}

Unfortunately, malicious actors have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor. Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy of 82\\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking for deepfake detection."}

Existing behavioral control methods face significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end, we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection (VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone. We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks."}

Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1) Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in \"Who Is the Spy\"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks.

Existing datasets often suffer from low resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust diagnostic tools.

When it comes to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions, preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large resolution increases.

Top-performing models achieved ~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging.

Although effective, such methods are inherently constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization, termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left, right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets."}

To address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation. Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP) using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks."}

Although prior work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space dynamics to address the question: \"How do diffusion models memorize?\" We show that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i) memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together, these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism of memorization in diffusion models."}

We evaluate a diverse set of MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks."}

Our analysis identifies a key cause of this instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process, leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality. The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a common failure mode in recursive training.

Building on these advancements, diffusion models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image. However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content manipulation across frames."}

In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8\\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.

Through dynamic similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only 4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31% improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning.

Specifically, we reformulate logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation, Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning: Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability.

Models were evaluated under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%.

Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover, reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage, multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact, general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid shortcut learning.

We begin with common failure cases-prompts like \"a cat and a dog\" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt. The goal is to steer towards \"pure\" joint modes where all concepts can coexist with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance; we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion systems."}

To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 10\\% in lexical accuracy and 25\\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii) achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing current leading visual foundation models by 8\\% in zero-shot visual grounding."}

Available CV methods for determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts, through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.

This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples. Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking.

PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics and extrinsics.

Then, a core module termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping regions.

The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI) is used to measure noise reduction.

To address these issues, we propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary semantic relevance judgments (\"Yes/No\"), which goes beyond CLIP's global feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications.

To this end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages. Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration.

Current text-to-scene methods often struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models (LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical, functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs."}

Although gradient-based solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\\% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\\% (from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

They either rely on computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity. We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition. Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling latency.

In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations. These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model inter-patch dynamics.

Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage. 2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945 real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image understanding.

We evaluate five pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN) alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head.

Instead of representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting distillation performance.

A key challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories. Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2) Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results, particularly in novel-class accuracy.

In this work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt, IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c) formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively Updated Preference Objective.

Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs, worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters, without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT.

Although 8-bit outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in 4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations, leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression (QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing outlier preservation and LSB precision.

While active research is in progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while optimizing using the likelihood score.

This becomes problematic when the applied blur is undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model.

Thanks to this characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot generalization.

To further mitigate the spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest zero-shot baseline.

Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by 18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on a wide range of datasets.

We argue that robust generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group, SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network, whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark. It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans, lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\\ell1$ on OmniObject3D by 14%.

We contend that in current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism. Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and multi-subject composition.

To address this challenge, we present a mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and decoding time into a unified performance score. The model normalizes and balances these metrics through a principled weighting scheme, enabling objective and fair comparisons among diverse algorithms. Extensive experiments on image and text datasets validate the approach, showing that it reliably identifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings. Results also reveal that while modern learning-based codecs often provide superior compression ratios, classical algorithms remain advantageous when speed is paramount. The proposed framework offers a robust and adaptable decision-support tool for selecting optimal lossless data compression techniques, bridging theoretical measures with practical application needs."}

Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking, a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance synergistic information through an \\textbf{Inf}inite \\textbf{Masking} strategy. InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities.

Most existing approaches primarily characterize tumor growth while neglecting the concomitant alterations in adjacent anatomical structures. In reality, tumor evolution is highly non-linear and heterogeneous, shaped not only by therapeutic interventions but also by its spatial context and interaction with neighboring tissues. Therefore, it is critical to model tumor progression in conjunction with surrounding anatomy to obtain a comprehensive and clinically relevant understanding of disease dynamics. We introduce a mathematically grounded framework that unites mechanistic partial differential equations with differentiable deep learning. Anatomy is represented as a multi-class probability field on the simplex and evolved by a cross-diffusion reaction-diffusion system that enforces inter-class competition and exclusivity. A differentiable implicit-explicit scheme treats stiff diffusion implicitly while handling nonlinear reaction and event terms explicitly, followed by projection back to the simplex. To further enhance global plausibility, we introduce a topology regularizer that simultaneously enforces centerline preservation and penalizes region overlaps. The approach is validated on synthetic datasets and a clinical dataset. On synthetic benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving topology, and also demonstrates superior performance on the clinical dataset.

The model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop: step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency; step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing intrinsic interpretability.

While neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel environments."}

To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency and supports long-duration video processing.

To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes. Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal component subspace.

Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving the heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes.

We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning (AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4 points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39% if those were allowed.

These priors allow latent visual capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively. This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T token scale pre-training.

Most existing methods are based on U-shape structure and use element-wise addition or concatenation to fuse different level features progressively in decoder. However, both the two operations easily generate plenty of redundant information, which will weaken the complementarity between different level features, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred edges of lesions. To address this challenge, we propose a general multi-scale in multi-scale subtraction network (M$^{2}$SNet) to finish diverse segmentation from medical image. Specifically, we first design a basic subtraction unit (SU) to produce the difference features between adjacent levels in encoder. Next, we expand the single-scale SU to the intra-layer multi-scale SU, which can provide the decoder with both pixel-level and structure-level difference information. Then, we pyramidally equip the multi-scale SUs at different levels with varying receptive fields, thereby achieving the inter-layer multi-scale feature aggregation and obtaining rich multi-scale difference information. In addition, we build a training-free network ``LossNet'' to comprehensively supervise the task-aware features from bottom layer to top layer, which drives our multi-scale subtraction network to capture the detailed and structural cues simultaneously. Without bells and whistles, our method performs favorably against most state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics on eleven datasets of four different medical image segmentation tasks of diverse image modalities, including color colonoscopy imaging, ultrasound imaging, computed tomography (CT), and optical coherence tomography (OCT).

Existing methods can be classified into offline techniques, which can generate high-quality novel views but at the cost of long inference/training time, and online methods, which either lack generalizability or produce unsatisfactory results. However, we have observed that the intrinsic sparse manifold of Multi-plane Images (MPI) enables a significant acceleration of light field generation while maintaining rendering quality. Based on this insight, we introduce EffLiFe, a novel light field optimization method, which leverages the proposed Hierarchical Sparse Gradient Descent (HSGD) to produce high-quality light fields from sparse view images in real time. Technically, the coarse MPI of a scene is first generated using a 3D CNN, and it is further sparsely optimized by focusing only on important MPI gradients in a few iterations. Nevertheless, relying solely on optimization can lead to artifacts at occlusion boundaries. Therefore, we propose an occlusion-aware iterative refinement module that removes visual artifacts in occluded regions by iteratively filtering the input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves comparable visual quality while being 100x faster on average than state-of-the-art offline methods and delivering better performance (about 2 dB higher in PSNR) compared to other online approaches."}

Integrating these interfaces with computer vision techniques, which possess efficient feature extraction capabilities, can achieve more robust and accurate detection of dim targets in aerial images.

In this paper, we first build a brain-eye-computer based object detection system for aerial images under few-shot conditions. This system detects suspicious targets using region proposal networks, evokes the event-related potential (ERP) signal in electroencephalogram (EEG) through the eye-tracking-based slow serial visual presentation (ESSVP) paradigm, and constructs the EEG-image data pairs with eye movement data. Then, an adaptive modality balanced online knowledge distillation (AMBOKD) method is proposed to recognize dim objects with the EEG-image data. AMBOKD fuses EEG and image features using a multi-head attention module, establishing a new modality with comprehensive features. To enhance the performance and robust capability of the fusion modality, simultaneous training and mutual learning between modalities are enabled by end-to-end online knowledge distillation. During the learning process, an adaptive modality balancing module is proposed to ensure multimodal equilibrium by dynamically adjusting the weights of the importance and the training gradients across various modalities.

To address these issues, we propose LoRA-PT, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that transfers the pre-trained UNETR model from the BraTS2021 dataset to the hippocampus segmentation task. Specifically, LoRA-PT divides the parameter matrix of the transformer structure into three distinct sizes, yielding three third-order tensors. These tensors are decomposed using tensor singular value decomposition to generate low-rank tensors consisting of the principal singular values and vectors, with the remaining singular values and vectors forming the residual tensor. During fine-tuning, only the low-rank tensors (i.e., the principal tensor singular values and vectors) are updated, while the residual tensors remain unchanged.

Such detectors typically have a feature backbone to extract useful features from raw input images. A common practice in current detectors is initializing the backbone with pre-trained weights available online. Fine-tuning the backbone is typically required to generate features suitable for remote-sensing images. While the prolonged training could lead to over-fitting, hindering the extraction of basic visual features, it can enable models to gradually extract deeper insights and richer representations from remote sensing data. Striking a balance between these competing factors is critical for achieving optimal performance. In this study, we aim to investigate the performance and characteristics of remote sensing object detection models under very long training schedules, and propose a novel method named Dynamic Backbone Freezing (DBF) for feature backbone fine-tuning on remote sensing object detection under long-term training. Our method addresses the dilemma of whether the backbone should extract low-level generic features or possess specific knowledge of the remote sensing domain, by introducing a module called 'Freezing Scheduler' to manage the update of backbone features during long-term training dynamically.

Essentially, this compensates for the class-relevant semantics that may be lost during strong augmentation on the fly.

Therefore, we compare a Swin UNETR trained on multi-temporal data with a U-Net trained on mono-temporal data to assess the effect of temporal information compared with conventional single-epoch approaches. To this end, a multi-temporal dataset comprising 1356 images, each with 32 sequential crack propagation images, was created. After training the models, experiments were conducted to analyze their generalization ability, temporal consistency, and segmentation quality. The multi-temporal approach consistently outperformed its mono-temporal counterpart, achieving an IoU of $82.72\\%$ and a F1-score of $90.54\\%$, representing a significant improvement over the mono-temporal model's IoU of $76.69\\%$ and F1-score of $86.18\\%$, despite requiring only half of the trainable parameters.

Merging models into one universal model to empower multi-task ability refraining from data leakage has gained popularity. With the expansion in data and model size, parameter-efficient tuning becomes the common practice for obtaining task-specific models efficiently. However, few methods are dedicated to efficient merging, and existing methods designed for full fine-tuning merging fail under efficient merging. To address the issue, we analyze from low-rank decomposition and reveal that direction robustness during merging is crucial for merging efficient modules. We furthermore uncover that compensating for the gap between stark singular values contributes to direction robustness. Therefore, we propose RobustMerge, a training-free parameter-efficient merging method with complementary parameter adaptation to maintain direction robustness. Specifically, we (1) prune parameters and scale coefficients from inter-parameter relation for singular values to maintain direction stability away from task interference, and (2) perform cross-task normalization to enhance unseen task generalization. We establish a benchmark consisting of diverse multimodal tasks, on which we conduct experiments to certify the outstanding performance and generalizability of our method.

For handling heterogeneity, we employ a prototype-guided optimal transport alignment strategy leveraging gaussian mixture modeling and multi-marginal transport plans, thus mitigating distribution discrepancies while preserving modality-unique characteristics. To reinforce homogeneity, we ensure semantic consistency across modalities by aligning latent distribution matching with Maximum Mean Discrepancy regularization. Furthermore, we incorporate a multimodal transformer to enhance high-level semantic feature fusion, thereby further reducing cross-modal inconsistencies. Our extensive experiments on four widely used multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that DecAlign consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across five metrics.

We create a dataset of 3,217 gender-neutral prompts and generate 200 images over 5 prompt variations per prompt from five leading T2I models. We automatically detect the perceived gender of people in the generated images and filter out images with no person or multiple people of different genders, leaving 2,293,295 images.

Our core mechanism, Boundary Consistency Regularized Multi-Task Learning (BCRM), enforces prediction agreement between teacher and student models on both segmentation masks and detailed semantic boundaries, providing complementary supervision from two independent tasks.

Surprisingly, increasing dataset diversity does not resolve this inter-dataset gap, with close to 60% attributed to dataset-specific biases. To address this remaining generalization gap, we propose a novel architecture extending a mostly dataset-agnostic encoder-decoder structure with fewer than 20 dataset-specific parameters that govern interpretable mechanisms such as multi-scale structure, center bias, and fixation spread. Adapting only these parameters to new data accounts for more than 75% of the generalization gap, with a large fraction of the improvement achieved with as few as 50 samples.

Existing approaches either rely on exemplar rehearsal, raising concerns over memory and privacy, or adapt static image-based methods that neglect temporal modeling. To address these limitations, we propose Spatiotemporal Preservation and Routing (StPR), a unified and exemplar-free VCIL framework that explicitly disentangles and preserves spatiotemporal information.

These intricate interactions call for a more adaptive and modality-aware decoding strategy. In this paper, we propose Audio-Visual Contrastive Decoding (AVCD)-a novel, training-free decoding framework designed to model trimodal interactions and suppress modality-induced hallucinations in AV-LLMs. Unlike previous CD methods in VLMs that corrupt a fixed modality, AVCD leverages attention distributions to dynamically identify less dominant modalities and applies attentive masking to generate perturbed output logits. To support CD in a trimodal setting, we also reformulate the original CD framework to jointly handle audio, visual, and textual inputs. Finally, to improve efficiency, we introduce entropy-guided adaptive decoding, which selectively skips unnecessary decoding steps based on the model's confidence in its predictions.

By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities."}

To address this, SFO introduces additional synthetic negative targets and explicitly guides the model to favor positives over negatives through pairwise comparison. For negative targets, we propose Condition-Degradation Negative Sampling (CDNS), which automatically produces synthetic negatives tailored for subject-driven generation by introducing controlled degradations that emphasize subject fidelity and text alignment without expensive human annotations. Moreover, we reweight the diffusion timesteps to focus fine-tuning on intermediate steps where subject details emerge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFO with CDNS significantly outperforms recent strong baselines in terms of both subject fidelity and text alignment on a subject-driven generation benchmark.

To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to \"seeing twice and thinking backwards\". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description, and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during training.

In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this three-axis space as the Hallucination Tri-Space and introduce the Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted, axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems."}

Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories (faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast, robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings. Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods, metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification."}

Conducting such an analysis is crucial for understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network (HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in both spectral and spatial dimensions.

To address these limitations, we propose an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks. This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.

To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.

Current approaches typically disentangle the two and treat them as separate endeavors with disjoint objectives, missing the mutual benefits. We argue that true unification requires more than just merging two tasks. It requires a unified, foundational objective that intrinsically links them. In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder lens, i.e., regarding understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. To implement this, we propose UAE, where we begin by pre-training the decoder with the proposed 700k long-context image-caption pairs to direct it to \"understand\" the fine-grained and complex semantics from the text. We then propose Unified-GRPO via reinforcement learning (RL) to unify the two, which covers two complementary stages: (1) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction quality, enhancing its visual perception; (2) Understanding for Generation, where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and generation fidelity. Our empirical results suggest that understanding can largely enhance generation (verified on GenEval), while generation, in turn, notably strengthens fine-grained visual perception like small object and color recognition (verified on MMT-Bench). This bidirectional improvement reveals a deep synergy: under the unified reconstruction objective, generation and understanding can mutually benefit each other, moving closer to truly unified multimodal intelligence."}

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network (BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution (S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional spatial features.

In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier, centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy optimization.

Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement, RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally, Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width.

However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions."}

We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful approach, providing actionable insights into SSL with VFMs and paving the way for more scalable and practical semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models."}

Recently, vision-language models (VLMs), pre-trained on massive image-text pairs, have demonstrated remarkable zero-/few-shot performance that often surpasses SSL approaches due to their exceptional generalization capabilities. This gap motivates us to question: how can we effectively harness the powerful generalization capabilities of VLMs into task-specific models? Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a natural framework for transferring VLM capabilities, but we identify that it suffers from gradient conflicts between supervised and distillation losses. To address this challenge, we propose Dual-Head Optimization (DHO), which introduces dual prediction heads for each distinct signal. We observe that DHO resolves gradient conflicts, enabling improved feature learning compared to single-head KD baselines, with practical benefits of minimal computational overhead and test-time hyperparameter tuning without retraining. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets show that DHO consistently outperforms KD baselines, often outperforming teacher models with smaller student models. DHO also achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both in-distribution ImageNet semi-supervised learning and out-of-distribution generalization across ImageNet variants.

However, existing models typically process images only once and thereafter generate reasoning entirely in text, lacking mechanisms to re-access or ground inference in visual representations. We empirically confirm this: as reasoning chains lengthen, models progressively lose focus on relevant regions. In response, we introduce v1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a simple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant image patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream, ensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence. Crucially, our pointing strategy lets the MLLM directly select image patches using their semantic representations as keys, keeping perceptual evidence embedded in the same space as the model's reasoning. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Across various multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, v1 consistently outperforms comparable baselines, establishing dynamic visual access based on point-and-copy as a practical mechanism for grounded reasoning.

This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling.

Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies.

Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework.

Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate, rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy, validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions, achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25% validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values.

Ngai", "title": "On-the-Fly Adaptation to Quantization: Configuration-Aware LoRA for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Quantized LLMs", "abstract": "As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression. Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set, yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that, unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods."}

Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work, we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity (e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour.

The input is a rich set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization for minimal uncertainty.

First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4) an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.

By leveraging the spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs, thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source, insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies, struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.

Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking, a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance synergistic information through an \\textbf{Inf}inite \\textbf{Masking} strategy. InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities.

In this work, we introduce MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large (making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4% and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches, respectively, under complete observations.

Based on 54 experiments across diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale, data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget, larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training."}

However, a persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM) within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast, the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of system physics."}

However, the robustness of TGNNs against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic, easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection (to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT) demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Intrinsic reward based on uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM). During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari. Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari.

Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability.

These models are often trained using flow matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points $(\\mathbf{x}_0,\\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned, on average, with $\\mathbf{x}_1-\\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment linking $\\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT) solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly, which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle. Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring $O(n^2/\\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity field, where $\\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency on $n/\\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models."}

To reduce inference cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model (LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off between cost and quality."}

We first show that the input information available to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model, we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed.

Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic sparsity."}

In other words, they can only improve performance on problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer. Consequently, the model's \"upper limit\" remains unchanged after RL training, even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase. These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples, we propose NuRL, a \"nudging\" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated, avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model. Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has converged."}

We aim to identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers, consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness.

We introduce Expert Merging, a training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs.

In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient operator learning."}

Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns, allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence, represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\\mathcal{FI}$-Markov equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent confounders."}

To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones, and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models. Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x.

An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline.

While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times, and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm achieves a regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T \\log T} + {\\log T}/{\\Delta^2})$, where $\\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the asynchronous and decentralized environment.

However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity, presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario. Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding. Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods across diverse tasks.

However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge, thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically ambiguous misaligned samples.

However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation. Viewing each task's exploration as an \"item\" with a distinct \"value\" and \"cost\", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational \"free lunch\", our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources."}

Asymmetric actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are both practical and theoretically sound."}

This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output (VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view, we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings, whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam."}

We identify two main sources of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly improving stealth.

To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes. Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal component subspace.

We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular (EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering (targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD) analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB). Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96% classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces. This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios."}

In this work, we reveal that the clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy, while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training."}

HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically, signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than 40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware.

Some of the existing learning algorithms cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting. As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way. By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of two.

In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data, (ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates (0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40°C) demonstrates that the GP-based method reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases.

However, traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial: by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can \"buy\" stronger guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than their black-box counterparts.

Such strategic deception - often known as \"sandbagging\" - threatens to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and incompetence from sequences of test scores.

To address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust learning."}

Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks."}

First, we propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives, aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress detection, motor imagery).

Instead of directly manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to steer generation towards various desirable behaviors.

For instruction following, we show that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in both closed-book and open-book settings.

We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.

Memory retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each other.

This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schrödinger bridges when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities, with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schrödinger bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method.

This dependence, which can manifest itself even as simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay."}

However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing. Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free, plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement under the same throughput budget.

To detect and prevent overthinking, we propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT) -- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget for all questions.

With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14 Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms."}

The mainstream sequence parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency, restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention.

Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment strategies."}

However, existing PRMs either treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome. Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling, the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison. Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth."}

This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning (AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4 points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39% if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit annotations."}

In this work, we introduce a unified UQ framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS, logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models.

These priors allow latent visual capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively. This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level Existence Bench (MLE-Bench).

Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains -- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA.

Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size, ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training pipeline for PSRL.

This paper presents Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage.

To increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay."}

We conducted a global survey of 91 ML practitioners to collect diverse insights into current monitoring practices for ML systems. We aim to complement existing research through our qualitative and quantitative analyses, focusing on prevalent runtime issues, industrial monitoring and mitigation practices, key challenges, and desired enhancements in future monitoring tools. Our findings reveal that practitioners frequently struggle with runtime issues related to declining model performance, exceeding latency, and security violations. While most prefer automated monitoring for its increased efficiency, many still rely on manual approaches due to the complexity or lack of appropriate automation solutions. Practitioners report that the initial setup and configuration of monitoring tools is often complicated and challenging, particularly when integrating with ML systems and setting alert thresholds. Moreover, practitioners find that monitoring adds extra workload, strains resources, and causes alert fatigue.

These tasks require a code retrieval system that can handle specific queries about code entities, or code entity queries (for example, locating a specific class or retrieving the dependencies of a function), as well as general queries without explicit code entities, or natural language queries (for example, describing a task and retrieving the corresponding code). We present RANGER, a repository-level code retrieval agent designed to address both query types, filling a gap in recent works that have focused primarily on code-entity queries. We first present a tool that constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire repository, capturing hierarchical and cross-file dependencies down to the variable level, and augments graph nodes with textual descriptions and embeddings to bridge the gap between code and natural language. RANGER then operates on this graph through a dual-stage retrieval pipeline. Entity-based queries are answered through fast Cypher lookups, while natural language queries are handled by MCTS-guided graph exploration. We evaluate RANGER across four diverse benchmarks that represent core ASE tasks including code search, question answering, cross-file dependency retrieval, and repository-level code completion. On CodeSearchNet and RepoQA it outperforms retrieval baselines that use embeddings from strong models such as Qwen3-8B. On RepoBench, it achieves superior cross-file dependency retrieval over baselines, and on CrossCodeEval, pairing RANGER with BM25 delivers the highest exact match rate in code completion compared to other RAG methods."}

Planning involves structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior. Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar, path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent computations, though earlier blocks remain informative."}

However, extending these advances to GeoSQL tasks in the PostGIS environment remains challenging due to the complexity of spatial functions, geometric data types, and execution semantics. Existing evaluations primarily focus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation, leaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To address this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive dimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge acquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and robustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset comprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions, and 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically evaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying entropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in performance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns. Furthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables global research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison. These contributions not only extend the boundaries of NL2SQL applications but also provide a standardized, interpretable, and scalable framework for evaluating LLM performance in spatial database contexts, offering valuable insights for model optimization and applications in geographic information science, urban studies, and spatial analysis."}

A systematic, cross-task understanding of how different noise types impact these models is lacking. Here, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to simulated quantum (Poisson) and electronic (Gaussian) noise in two key chest X-ray tasks: semantic segmentation and pulmonary disease classification. Using a novel, scalable noise injection framework, we applied controlled, clinically-motivated noise severities to common architectures (UNet, DeepLabV3, FPN; ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet) on public datasets (Landmark, ChestX-ray14). Our results reveal a stark dichotomy in task robustness. Semantic segmentation models proved highly vulnerable, with lung segmentation performance collapsing under severe electronic noise (Dice Similarity Coefficient drop of 0.843), signifying a near-total model failure. In contrast, classification tasks demonstrated greater overall resilience, but this robustness was not uniform. We discovered a differential vulnerability: certain tasks, such as distinguishing Pneumothorax from Atelectasis, failed catastrophically under quantum noise (AUROC drop of 0.355), while others were more susceptible to electronic noise. These findings demonstrate that while classification models possess a degree of inherent robustness, pixel-level segmentation tasks are far more brittle.

If one uses a highly focused X-ray beam, the measurements would also become sensitive to the beam positions relative to each particle and therefore ptychographic, but these positions are also unknown. We investigate the viability of image reconstruction in a simulated, simplified 2-D variant of this difficult problem, using variational inference with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion models. We find that, with the right illumination structure and a strong prior, one can achieve reliable and successful image reconstructions even under measurement noise, in all except the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario."}

This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method."}

Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g., ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks (e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We further introduce Overuse Rate ($\\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count ($\\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\\% of LLM agents display a pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall Risk Score ($\\Phi_\\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected to operational pressures.

Our dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes. Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on all questions.

Given a user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written \"user prompt\" and evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values, such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict.

However, when applied to more complex tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities. Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both answer correctness and usefulness."}

This results in inefficient exploration of reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and performs search over the two phases individually.

In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR (Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable, and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item response model from model responses with different budgets to different queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and model-budget abilities.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However, existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities.

In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms.

Building on this, we introduce Conditional Generator using MMD (CGMMD), a novel framework for conditional sampling. Unlike many contemporary approaches, our method frames the training objective as a simple, adversary-free direct minimization problem. A key feature of CGMMD is its ability to produce conditional samples in a single forward pass of the generator, enabling practical one-shot sampling with low test-time complexity. We establish rigorous theoretical bounds on the loss incurred when sampling from the CGMMD sampler, and prove convergence of the estimated distribution to the true conditional distribution. In the process, we also develop a uniform concentration result for nearest-neighbor based functionals, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we show that CGMMD performs competitively on synthetic tasks involving complex conditional densities, as well as on practical applications such as image denoising and image super-resolution."}

Existing datasets often suffer from low resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net, leveraging the strengths of both methods.

Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for communication.

Process rewards address this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without \"golden\" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link."}

We present a new theoretical perspective, associated assumptions for when estimating treatment effects with the CB is feasible, and a bound on the average error of the treatment effect when the CB assumptions are violated. From this new perspective, we then demonstrate how coupling the CB with an autoencoder architecture allows for the sharing of statistical strength between observed quantities (proxies, treatment, and outcomes), thus improving the quality of the CB estimates.

Common practice for autoregressive language models typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning without reliance on external reward models."}

We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes.

Hence, existing works mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining high-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural networks.

Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy -- models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods: approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models (e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual correctness and uncertainty.

Current code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models' coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent), which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference."}

As such, LLMs are now a key driver behind the automation of language processing systems, such as AI agents. Unfortunately, these advantages have come with a vulnerability to prompt injections, an attack where an adversary subverts the LLM's intended functionality with an injected task. Past approaches have proposed detectors and finetuning to provide robustness, but these techniques are vulnerable to adaptive attacks or cannot be used with state-of-the-art models. To this end we propose type-directed privilege separation for LLMs, a method that systematically prevents prompt injections. We restrict the ability of an LLM to interact with third-party data by converting untrusted content to a curated set of data types; unlike raw strings, each data type is limited in scope and content, eliminating the possibility for prompt injections. We evaluate our method across several case studies and find that designs leveraging our principles can systematically prevent prompt injection attacks while maintaining high utility."}

We investigate how training data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across structural variations but not across color distributions.

We begin with common failure cases-prompts like \"a cat and a dog\" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt. The goal is to steer towards \"pure\" joint modes where all concepts can coexist with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance; we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior compositional methods.

Current research primarily focuses on leveraging additional hardware resources and powerful computing units to accelerate the training process. As a result, larger batch sizes are often employed to speed up training. However, training with large batch sizes can lead to lower accuracy due to poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose the dual batch size learning scheme, a distributed training method built on the parameter server framework. This approach maximizes training efficiency by utilizing the largest batch size that the hardware can support while incorporating a smaller batch size to enhance model generalization. By using two different batch sizes simultaneously, this method reduces testing loss and enhances generalization, with minimal extra training time. Additionally, to mitigate the time overhead caused by dual batch size learning, we propose the cyclic progressive learning scheme. This technique gradually adjusts image resolution from low to high during training, significantly boosting training speed. By combining cyclic progressive learning with dual batch size learning, our hybrid approach improves both model generalization and training efficiency.

In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers.

Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving the heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes.

We find that, regardless of dataset size or model capacity, models trained only on stable structures fail dramatically to even qualitatively reproduce the H$_2$ energy curve. Only when compressed and stretched geometries are explicitly included in training do the predictions roughly resemble the correct shape. Nonetheless, the largest foundation models trained on the largest and most diverse datasets containing dissociating diatomics exhibit serious failures on simple diatomic molecules.

While recent advances have focused on large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models, which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and computationally efficient strategy.

In this paper, we revisit the problem of predicting individualized potential outcomes in sequential decision-making (i.e., estimating Q-functions in Markov decision processes with observational data) through a causal inference lens. In particular, we develop a comprehensive theoretical foundation for meta-learners in this setting with a focus on beneficial theoretical properties. As a result, we yield a novel meta-learner called DRQ-learner and establish that it is: (1) doubly robust (i.e., valid inference under the misspecification of one of the nuisances), (2) Neyman-orthogonal (i.e., insensitive to first-order estimation errors in the nuisance functions), and (3) achieves quasi-oracle efficiency (i.e., behaves asymptotically as if the ground-truth nuisance functions were known). Our DRQ-learner is applicable to settings with both discrete and continuous state spaces. Further, our DRQ-learner is flexible and can be used together with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks).

Since large language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e., explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned, not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates, security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in judgment and decision-making."}

Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers.

This prevents the agent from being useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a software engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer during code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an automated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug, improves readability, implements a feature).As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be manually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses from a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower developer productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In this paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided by a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high level, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's response and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis tools to verify the agent's reasoning steps.We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable errors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the uninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to validate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program equivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8 incorrect judgments made by the agent."}

In this work, we study how the structure of pretraining tasks governs generalization in ICL. Using a solvable model for ICL of linear regression by linear attention, we derive an exact expression for ICL generalization error in high dimensions under arbitrary pretraining-testing task covariance mismatch. This leads to a new alignment measure that quantifies how much information about the pretraining task distribution is useful for inference at test time. We show that this measure directly predicts ICL performance not only in the solvable model but also in nonlinear Transformers. Our analysis further reveals a tradeoff between specialization and generalization in ICL: depending on task distribution alignment, increasing pretraining task diversity can either improve or harm test performance. Together, these results identify train-test task alignment as a key determinant of generalization in ICL."}

Inspired by system audit provenance graphs, DeepProv models the computational information flow of a DNN's inference process through Inference Provenance Graphs (IPGs). These graphs provide a detailed structural representation of the behavior of DNN, allowing both empirical and structural analysis. DeepProv uses these insights to systematically repair DNNs for specific objectives, such as improving robustness, privacy, or fairness.We instantiate DeepProv with adversarial robustness as the goal of model repair and conduct extensive case studies to evaluate its effectiveness. Our results demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability across diverse classification tasks, attack scenarios, and model complexities. DeepProv automatically identifies repair actions at the node and edge-level within IPGs, significantly enhancing the robustness of the model. In particular, applying DeepProv repair strategies to just a single layer of a DNN yields an average 55% improvement in adversarial accuracy. Moreover, DeepProv complements existing defenses, achieving substantial gains in adversarial robustness.

Beyond known attack vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B), each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs without compromising fairness or reliability."}

However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly, common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints, OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover, preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact preservation than widely used baselines.

We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via automatically-generated bounding boxes.

We find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top models still have significant room for improvement in position-based generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206% on PosEval.

The recently described implicit-PDF (IPDF) is a simple, elegant, and effective approach for learning arbitrary distributions on SO(3) up to a given precision. However, inference with IPDF requires $N$ forward passes through the network's final multilayer perceptron (where $N$ places an upper bound on the likelihood that can be calculated by the model), which is prohibitively slow for those without the computational resources necessary to parallelize the queries. In this paper, I introduce AQuaMaM, a neural network capable of both learning complex distributions on the rotation manifold and calculating exact likelihoods for query rotations in a single forward pass. Specifically, AQuaMaM autoregressively models the projected components of unit quaternions as mixtures of uniform distributions that partition their geometrically-restricted domain of values. When trained on an \"infinite\" toy dataset with ambiguous viewpoints, AQuaMaM rapidly converges to a sampling distribution closely matching the true data distribution. In contrast, the sampling distribution for IPDF dramatically diverges from the true data distribution, despite IPDF approaching its theoretical minimum evaluation loss during training. When trained on a constructed dataset of 500,000 renders of a die in different rotations, AQuaMaM reaches a test log-likelihood 14% higher than IPDF.

Our study sheds light on the current state of ME vulnerability in the wild and points to several promising directions for future research."}

Achieving exact unlearning in deep learning pipelines--producing models as if certain data had never been included in training--remains an open problem. In this paper, we revisit exact unlearning in deep learning and show that for large language models (LLMs) we can efficiently exactly unlearn \"fine-tuning data\" (the data used to adapt a pre-trained model). This follows from two observations. First, we can use in-context learning to adapt the LLM to the fine-tuning dataset instead of SGD based algorithms. Second, we show that accurate in-context learning can be done with quantized k-means, which allows for effectively constant time unlearning operations. Our evaluation shows that this unlearning recipe has similar performance to fine-tuning alternatives, but vastly reduces the unlearning costs. Our study also highlights the need for new measures of unlearning cost when adapting the learning algorithm to have faster unlearn operations."}

However, when a significant number of individuals seek similar state modifications, this individual-centric approach can inadvertently create competition and introduce unforeseen costs. Additionally, disregarding the underlying data distribution may lead to recommendations that individuals perceive as unusual or impractical. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that extends standard counterfactual explanations by incorporating a population dynamics model. This framework penalizes deviations from equilibrium after individuals follow the recommendations, effectively mitigating externalities caused by correlated changes across the population. By balancing individual modification costs with their impact on others, our method ensures more equitable and efficient outcomes. We show how this approach reframes the counterfactual explanation problem from an individual-centric task to a collective optimization problem.

However, translating DP budgets into quantitative protection against the more damaging threat of data reconstruction remains a challenging open problem. Existing theoretical analyses of reconstruction risk are typically based on an \"identification\" threat model, where an adversary with a candidate set seeks a perfect match. When applied to the realistic threat of \"from-scratch\" attacks, these bounds can lead to an inefficient privacy-utility trade-off.This paper bridges this critical gap by deriving the first formal privacy bounds tailored to the mechanics of demonstrated Analytic Gradient Inversion Attacks (AGIAs). We first formalize the optimal from-scratch attack strategy for an adversary with no prior knowledge, showing it reduces to a mean estimation problem. We then derive closed-form, probabilistic bounds on this adversary's success, measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Our empirical evaluation confirms these bounds remain tight even when the attack is concealed within large, complex network architectures.Our work provides a crucial second anchor for risk assessment. By establishing a tight, worst-case bound for the from-scratch threat model, we enable practitioners to assess a \"risk corridor\" bounded by the identification-based worst case on one side and our from-scratch worst case on the other. This allows for a more holistic, context-aware judgment of privacy risk, empowering practitioners to move beyond abstract budgets toward a principled reasoning framework for calibrating the privacy of their models."}

Existing strategies, including graph neural networks, face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimension and high-sparsity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce scCDCG (single-cell RNA-seq Clustering via Deep Cut-informed Graph), a novel framework designed for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information. scCDCG comprises three main components: (i) A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques, which effectively captures intercellular high-order structural information, overcoming the over-smoothing and inefficiency issues prevalent in prior graph neural network methods. (ii) A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to accommodate the unique complexities of scRNA-seq data, specifically its high-dimension and high-sparsity.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel parallel prompt decoding that requires only $0.0002$% trainable parameters, enabling efficient training on a single A100-40GB GPU in just 16 hours.

However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions."}

Guidance may, for example, come from annotated datasets in supervised learning, pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning, and expert demonstration policies in reinforcement learning. However, guidance signals can be noisy due to domain shifts and limited data availability and may not generalize well. Blindly trusting such signals when they are noisy, incomplete, or misaligned with the target domain can lead to degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Conformal Guidance (AdaConG), a simple yet effective approach that dynamically modulates the influence of guidance signals based on their associated uncertainty, quantified via split conformal prediction (CP). By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG enables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance learning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse tasks, including knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification, gridworld navigation, and autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaConG improves performance and robustness under imperfect guidance, e.g., in gridworld navigation, it accelerates convergence and achieves over $6\\times$ higher rewards than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight AdaConG as a broadly applicable solution for learning under uncertainty."}

However, with the rapid development of the open-source AI ecosystem and the increasing availability of fine-tuned foundation models, existing model merging methods face two key limitations: (i) They are primarily designed for in-house fine-tuned models, making them less adaptable to diverse model sources with partially unknown model and task information, (ii) They struggle to scale effectively when merging numerous model checkpoints. To address these challenges, we formulate model merging as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel approach: Frank-Wolfe Merging (FW-Merging). Inspired by Frank-Wolfe optimization, our approach iteratively selects the most relevant model in the pool to minimize a linear approximation of the objective function and then executes a local merging similar to the Frank-Wolfe update. The objective function is designed to capture the desired behavior of the target-merged model, while the fine-tuned candidate models define the constraint set. More importantly, FW-Merging serves as an orthogonal technique for existing merging methods, seamlessly integrating with them to further enhance accuracy performance. Our experiments show that FW-Merging scales across diverse model sources, remaining stable with 16 irrelevant models and improving by 15.3% with 16 relevant models on 20 CV tasks, while maintaining constant memory overhead, unlike the linear overhead of data-informed merging methods.

We propose to go beyond hand-crafted decision rules by learning directly from the complete observable output of LLMs -- consisting not only of next-token probabilities, but also the full sequence of next-token distributions. We refer to this as the LLM Output Signature (LOS), and treat it as a reference data type for detecting hallucinations and data contamination.

However, learned behaviors like attention sinks, where the first token receives the most attention despite limited semantic importance, suggest some heads may be inactive, and point to a significant source of computational redundancy. To analyze this phenomenon, we propose a taxonomy of 13 score functions that measure different ways a head can be inactive. Thresholding these scores allows us to analyze different sets of potentially inactive attention heads. We evaluate whether identified heads are inactive through model interventions, finding that more than 12% of attention heads are inactive on average, and can be ablated in specific contexts while maintaining MMLU accuracy to within 1% of the pretrained LLM. Across 3 model families, our score functions that measure the average norm of a head's output consistently identify inactive heads that would not have been found by score functions that rely solely on attention weights. We establish that relying on a score function that measures a first token attention sink would underestimate the prevalence of inactive heads, failing to identify more than 7% of inactive heads on average. We also show how measuring score distributions can provide insights into attention behavior. For instance, we find evidence that finetuning causes little to no change in attention behavior, and that even within the same model family, large model scales present markedly different attention behaviors."}

In this work, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage (EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving optimal fairness.

In contrast, fully local learning rules are more efficient but often struggle to maintain the cross-layer coordination needed for coherent global learning. Building on this tension, we introduce Stochastic Layer-wise Learning (SLL), a layer-wise training algorithm that decomposes the global objective into coordinated layer-local updates while preserving global representational coherence. The method is ELBO-inspired under a Markov assumption on the network, where the network-level objective decomposes into layer-wise terms and each layer optimizes a local objective via a deterministic encoder. The intractable KL in ELBO is replaced by a Bhattacharyya surrogate computed on auxiliary categorical posteriors obtained via fixed geometry-preserving random projections, with optional multiplicative dropout providing stochastic regularization. SLL optimizes locally, aligns globally, thereby eliminating cross-layer backpropagation. Experiments on MLPs, CNNs, and Vision Transformers from MNIST to ImageNet show that the approach surpasses recent local methods and matches global BP performance while memory usage invariant with depth. The results demonstrate a practical and principled path to modular and scalable local learning that couples purely local computation with globally coherent representations."}

This gap motivates us to question: how can we effectively harness the powerful generalization capabilities of VLMs into task-specific models? Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a natural framework for transferring VLM capabilities, but we identify that it suffers from gradient conflicts between supervised and distillation losses. To address this challenge, we propose Dual-Head Optimization (DHO), which introduces dual prediction heads for each distinct signal. We observe that DHO resolves gradient conflicts, enabling improved feature learning compared to single-head KD baselines, with practical benefits of minimal computational overhead and test-time hyperparameter tuning without retraining. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets show that DHO consistently outperforms KD baselines, often outperforming teacher models with smaller student models.

We also identify a connection between GRPO and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach, yielding long and stable training dynamics; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training.

Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and $n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs. These works have advocated using batches of size $n\\approx 256$, and considered OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a. Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully on the effect of the entropic regularization $\\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\\varepsilon$."}

In this paper, we argue that generalization could be assessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We show that when an exponential family neural network model is exactly calibrated, and its prediction error and its confidence on the prediction are not correlated with the first and the second derivative of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the asymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect a soft rank based flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show that it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models that are not overly confident.

We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix.

While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training."}

Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100 time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine learning approaches to solid mechanics.

Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching.

To address this, we introduce SON-GOKU, a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated, and the grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, multi-task learning will improve model performance rather than impede it. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. We provide extensive theory showing why grouping and sequential updates improve multi-task learning, with guarantees on descent, convergence, and accurately identifying what tasks conflict or align."}

We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance."}

Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the \\emph{gradient ascent} of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. When hidden nodes start to interact in the later stage of learning, we provably show how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of feature emergence, memorization and generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics.

To overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and reinforces the determinism of execution.

Muon addresses this issue via global spectral normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we propose Column-Normalized Adam (Conda), a novel optimizer that bridges the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on the LLaMA series, Conda achieves 2-2.5 the convergence speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time. Further ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable optimizer for large-scale LLM training.

Due to the complexity of optimisation algorithms in most modern representation learning approaches, for a given method it may be non-trivial to decide whether the obtained fairness-performance curve of the method is optimal, i.e., whether it is close to the true Pareto front for these quantities for the underlying data distribution.In this paper we propose a new method to compute the optimal Pareto front, which does not require the training of complex representation models. We show that optimal fair representations possess several useful structural properties, and that these properties enable a reduction of the computation of the Pareto Front to a compact discrete problem. We then also show that these compact approximating problems can be efficiently solved via off-the shelf concave-convex programming methods.Since our approach is independent of the specific model of representations, it may be used as the benchmark to which representation learning algorithms may be compared. We experimentally evaluate the approach on a number of real world benchmark datasets."}

In this work, the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) is proposed, a novel method that employs a learnable refinement mechanism to enhance the classification token within the Transformer encoder architecture.

We first establish a reliable evaluation criterion comparing available methods and LLM judges against our human evaluations. Then we present a study evaluating 72 diverse SLMs from six major model families across 17 reasoning benchmarks. We repeat all our experiments three times to ensure a robust assessment.

However, value profiles effectively compress the useful information from demonstrations (>70% information preservation) and offer advantages in terms of scrutability, interpretability, and steerability. Furthermore, clustering value profiles to identify similarly behaving individuals better explains rater variation than the most predictive demographic groupings.

For senses such as touch, where the information is sparse and local, active perception becomes crucial. In recent years, active perception has emerged as an important research domain in robotics.

To address this gap, this work introduces APPLE (Active Perception Policy Learning) - a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to address a range of different active perception problems. APPLE jointly trains a transformer-based perception module and decision-making policy with a unified optimization objective, learning how to actively gather information. By design, APPLE is not limited to a specific task and can, in principle, be applied to a wide range of active perception problems. We evaluate two variants of APPLE across different tasks, including tactile exploration problems from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of APPLE, achieving high accuracies on both regression and classification tasks. These findings underscore the potential of APPLE as a versatile and general framework for advancing active perception in robotics."}

Instead of generating a single answer and then hedging it, an LLM that is fully transparent to the user needs to be able to reflect on its internal belief distribution and output a summary of all options it deems possible, and how likely they are. To test whether LLMs possess this capability, we develop the SelfReflect metric, an information-theoretic distance between a given summary and a distribution over answers. In interventional and human studies, we find that SelfReflect indicates even slight deviations, yielding a fine measure of faithfulness between a summary string and an LLM's actual internal distribution over answers. With SelfReflect, we make a resounding negative observation: modern LLMs are, across the board, incapable of revealing what they are uncertain about, neither through reasoning, nor chains-of-thoughts, nor explicit finetuning. However, we do find that LLMs are able to generate faithful summaries of their uncertainties if we help them by sampling multiple outputs and feeding them back into the context. This simple approach shines a light at the universal way of communicating LLM uncertainties whose future development the SelfReflect score enables."}

Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems."}

Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit language mixing-alternating languages within their chain of thought. Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy, suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We show that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on MATH500. Additionally, a lightweight probe can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by 2.92 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior."}

Yet, in practice, analyses are often complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address missingness is multiple imputation, which involves creating several completed datasets. However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to that of these recently proposed methods."}

In this paper, we construct strong white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather, realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural images seem to offer inherent robustness.

Richardson,Sokratis Trifinopoulos,Mike Williams", "title": "The DNA of nuclear models: How AI predicts nuclear masses", "abstract": "Obtaining high-precision predictions of nuclear masses, or equivalently nuclear binding energies, $E_b$, remains an important goal in nuclear-physics research. Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However, the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find that (and explain why) the most important dimensions of its internal representation form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop). Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969 based on the structure of most known nuclear ground states. The end result is a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses based on physics deduced by AI."}

In practice, Shampoo requires step-size grafting with Adam to achieve competitive performance. SOAP mitigates this by applying Adam in Shampoo's eigenbasis and further reducing per-iteration runtime. However, reliance on Adam introduces additional memory overhead in both methods. Prior theoretical interpretations have primarily examined their estimation schemes using the Frobenius norm. Motivated by the natural correspondence between the second moment and a covariance matrix, we reinterpret the estimation procedures in Shampoo and SOAP as instances of covariance estimation through the lens of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization. This perspective reveals a previously overlooked theoretical limitation and motivates principled improvements to their design. Building on the KL perspective, we propose practical estimation schemes -- $\\textbf{KL-Shampoo}$ and $\\textbf{KL-SOAP}$ -- that match or exceed the performance of Shampoo and SOAP for pre-training various NNs while maintaining SOAP-level per-iteration runtime.

In response, we propose three new tasks, posing that successful multi-modal models should be able to recognize, differentiate, and generate language descriptions of time series. We then create BEDTime, the first benchmark dataset to assess models on each task, comprising four datasets reformatted for these tasks across multiple modalities. Using BEDTime, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models, and find that (1) surprisingly, dedicated time series foundation models severely underperform, despite being designed for similar tasks, (2) vision-language models are quite capable, (3) language-only methods perform worst, despite many lauding their potential, and (4) all approaches are clearly fragile to a range of realistic robustness tests, indicating avenues for future work."}

The code generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action sequences of up to 18 steps.

To address these challenges, there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs), which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and wearable devices.

Although learning-based methods have made progress in MAPD, they often perform poorly in warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways and long corridors when relying only on local observations for distributed decision-making. Communication learning can alleviate the lack of global information but introduce high computational complexity due to point-to-point communication. To address this challenge, we formulate MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and prove that path-finding policies under sequence modeling possess order-invariant optimality, ensuring its effectiveness in MAPD. Building on this, we propose the Sequential Pathfinder (SePar), which leverages the Transformer paradigm to achieve implicit information exchange, reducing decision-making complexity from exponential to linear while maintaining efficiency and global awareness. Experiments demonstrate that SePar consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across various MAPF tasks and their variants, and generalizes well to unseen environments. Furthermore, we highlight the necessity of integrating imitation learning in complex maps like warehouses."}

Traditional approaches to studying dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a computational framework for investigating reading disorders."}

However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data. Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential."}

We conducted a global survey of 91 ML practitioners to collect diverse insights into current monitoring practices for ML systems. We aim to complement existing research through our qualitative and quantitative analyses, focusing on prevalent runtime issues, industrial monitoring and mitigation practices, key challenges, and desired enhancements in future monitoring tools. Our findings reveal that practitioners frequently struggle with runtime issues related to declining model performance, exceeding latency, and security violations. While most prefer automated monitoring for its increased efficiency, many still rely on manual approaches due to the complexity or lack of appropriate automation solutions. Practitioners report that the initial setup and configuration of monitoring tools is often complicated and challenging, particularly when integrating with ML systems and setting alert thresholds. Moreover, practitioners find that monitoring adds extra workload, strains resources, and causes alert fatigue.

The checklist is based on three main formalisms: DEVS, System Dynamics and Agent-Based Simulation. A pilot study was carried out and an expert was consulted.

In recent years, various automated Fault Localization (FL) techniques have demonstrated promising results in identifying errors in programs. However, existing FL techniques face challenges when applied to educational contexts. Most approaches operate at the method level without explanatory feedback, resulting in granularity too coarse for students who need actionable insights to identify and fix their errors. While some approaches attempt line-level fault localization, they often depend on predicting line numbers directly in numerical form, which is ill-suited to LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose FLAME, a fine-grained, explainable Fault Localization method tailored for programming assignments via LLM-guided Annotation and Model Ensemble. FLAME leverages rich contextual information specific to programming assignments to guide LLMs in identifying faulty code lines. Instead of directly predicting line numbers, we prompt the LLM to annotate faulty code lines with detailed explanations, enhancing both localization accuracy and educational value. To further improve reliability, we introduce a weighted multi-model voting strategy that aggregates results from multiple LLMs to determine the suspiciousness of each code line. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art fault localization baselines on programming assignments, successfully localizing 207 more faults at top-1 over the best-performing baseline. Beyond educational contexts, FLAME also generalizes effectively to general-purpose software codebases, outperforming all baselines on the Defects4J benchmark."}

Unlike traditional human-written clones, AI-generated clones exhibit systematic syntactic patterns and semantic differences learned from large-scale training data. This shift presents new challenges for classical code clone detection (CCD) tools, which have historically been validated primarily on human-authored codebases and optimized to detect syntactic (Type 1-3) and limited semantic clones. Given that AI-generated code can produce both syntactic and complex semantic clones, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of classical CCD tools within this new paradigm. In this paper, we systematically evaluate nine widely used CCD tools using GPTCloneBench, a benchmark containing GPT-3-generated clones. To contextualize and validate our results, we further test these detectors on established human-authored benchmarks, BigCloneBench and SemanticCloneBench, to measure differences in performance between traditional and AI-generated clones. Our analysis demonstrates that classical CCD tools, particularly those enhanced by effective normalization techniques, retain considerable effectiveness against AI-generated clones, while some exhibit notable performance variation compared to traditional benchmarks.

However, on-call engineers are often burdened with manually inspecting massive volumes of logs to identify root causes. While various automated tools have been proposed, they struggle in practice due to alert-agnostic log scoping and the inability to organize complex data effectively for reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LogPilot, an intent-aware and scalable framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated log-based alert diagnosis. LogPilot introduces an intent-aware approach, interpreting the logic in alert definitions (e.g., PromQL) to precisely identify causally related logs and requests. To achieve scalability, it reconstructs each request's execution into a spatiotemporal log chain, clusters similar chains to identify recurring execution patterns, and provides representative samples to the LLMs for diagnosis. This clustering-based approach ensures the input is both rich in diagnostic detail and compact enough to fit within the LLM's context window. Evaluated on real-world alerts from Volcano Engine Cloud, LogPilot improves the usefulness of root cause summarization by 50.34% and exact localization accuracy by 54.79% over state-of-the-art methods. With a diagnosis time under one minute and a cost of only $0.074 per alert, LogPilot has been successfully deployed in production, offering an automated and practical solution for service alert diagnosis."}

APR agents automatically fetch GitHub issues and use backend LLMs to generate patches that fix the reported bugs. However, existing work primarily focuses on the functional correctness of APR-generated patches, whether they pass hidden or regression tests, while largely ignoring potential security risks. Given the openness of platforms like GitHub, where any user can raise issues and participate in discussions, an important question arises: Can an adversarial user submit a valid issue on GitHub that misleads an LLM-based agent into generating a functionally correct but vulnerable patch? To answer this question, we propose SWExploit, which generates adversarial issue statements designed to make APR agents produce patches that are functionally correct yet vulnerable. SWExploit operates in three main steps: (1) program analysis to identify potential injection points for vulnerable payloads; (2) adversarial issue generation to provide misleading reproduction and error information while preserving the original issue semantics; and (3) iterative refinement of the adversarial issue statements based on the outputs of the APR agents. Empirical evaluation on three agent pipelines and five backend LLMs shows that SWExploit can produce patches that are both functionally correct and vulnerable (the attack success rate on the correct patch could reach 0.91, whereas the baseline ASRs are all below 0.20). Based on our evaluation, we are the first to challenge the traditional assumption that a patch passing all tests is inherently reliable and secure, highlighting critical limitations in the current evaluation paradigm for APR agents."}

However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose LLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's imbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm critical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm that mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human engineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying rules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the model within a simulated O&M environment, thereby reducing hallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first cold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13 strategies from manual O&M practices, to establish an initial reasoning capability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function.

Recent studies indicate that the energy consumption of mobile devices could be improved by improving the quality of mobile apps. Frequent refactoring is one way of achieving this goal. In this paper, we explore the performance and energy impact of several common code refactorings in Android apps. Experimental results indicate that some code smell refactorings positively impact the energy consumption of Android apps. Refactoring of the code smells \"Duplicated code\" and \"Type checking\" reduce energy consumption by up to 10.8%. Significant reduction in energy consumption, however, does not seem to be directly related to the increase or decrease of execution time. In addition, the energy impact over permutations of code smell refactorings in the selected Android apps was small. When analyzing the order in which refactorings were made across code smell types, it turned out that some permutations resulted in a reduction and some in an increase of energy consumption for the analyzed apps. More research needs to be done to investigate how factors like size and age of software apps, experience, and number of contributors to app development correlate with (a) the number and type of code smells found and (b) the impact of energy consumption and performance after refactoring."}

Our framework models social interactions, where a developer editing the code of other developers triggers accelerated activity among collaborators.

To address this, we introduce UniSage, the first unified framework to sample both traces and logs using a post-analysis-aware paradigm. Instead of discarding data upfront, UniSagefirst performs lightweight and multi-modal anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) on the complete data stream.

However, this approach yields only a single test suite, introducing a critical risk: if a test case forming a required 'independence pair' is an illegal input forbidden by system constraints, the suite fails to achieve 100% coverage. This paper proposes EQ-Robin, a lightweight pipeline that systematically generates a family of minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC suites to mitigate this risk. We introduce a method for systematically generating semantically equivalent SBEs by applying algebraic rearrangements to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the expression.

Existing approaches are ineffective at addressing this problem. To fill this gap, we present ErrorPrism in this work for automated reconstruction of error propagation paths in production microservice systems. ErrorPrism first performs static analysis on service code repositories to build a function call graph and map log strings to relevant candidate functions. This significantly reduces the path search space for subsequent analysis.

Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well- structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges.

However, a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over extended periods, they face \"memory inflation\" and \"contextual degradation\" issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive \"Intelligent Decay\" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates, contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable of effective long-term learning and adaptation."}

However, extending these advances to GeoSQL tasks in the PostGIS environment remains challenging due to the complexity of spatial functions, geometric data types, and execution semantics. Existing evaluations primarily focus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation, leaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To address this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive dimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge acquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and robustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset comprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions, and 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically evaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying entropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in performance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns. Furthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables global research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison. These contributions not only extend the boundaries of NL2SQL applications but also provide a standardized, interpretable, and scalable framework for evaluating LLM performance in spatial database contexts, offering valuable insights for model optimization and applications in geographic information science, urban studies, and spatial analysis."}

However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple \"world model\" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments.

This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.

In this work, we study benchmark reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony, which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography, Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of performance."}

Current code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models' coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent), which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference."}

Existing failure detection techniques struggle to expose such failures prior to deployment, as they typically require a complex combination of specific conditions to be triggered. This challenge stems from the inherent nature of cascading failures, as they typically involve a sequence of fault propagations, each activated by distinct conditions.This paper presents CSnake, a fault injection framework to expose self-sustaining cascading failures in distributed systems. CSnake uses the novel idea of causal stitching, which causally links multiple single-fault injections in different tests to simulate complex fault propagation chains. To identify these chains, CSnake designs a counterfactual causality analysis of fault propagations - fault causality analysis (FCA): FCA compares the execution trace of a fault injection run with its corresponding profile run (i.e., same test w/o the injection) and identifies any additional faults triggered, which are considered to have a causal relationship with the injected fault.To address the large search space of fault and workload combinations, CSnake employs a three-phase allocation protocol of test budget that prioritizes faults with unique and diverse causal consequences, increasing the likelihood of uncovering conditional fault propagations. Furthermore, to avoid incorrectly connecting fault propagations from workloads with incompatible conditions, CSnake performs a local compatibility check that approximately checks the compatibility of the path constraints associated with connected fault propagations with low overhead.CSnake detected 15 bugs that cause self-sustaining cascading failures in five systems, five of which have been confirmed with two fixed."}

Beyond known attack vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B), each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs without compromising fairness or reliability."}

Model-based analyses can estimate dependability, yet in practice they are tricky to build and keep current because models are typically handcrafted. We claim that a simple connectivity-only topological model - just the service-dependency graph plus replica counts - can provide fast, low-risk availability estimates under fail-stop faults. To make this claim practical without hand-built models, we introduce model discovery: an automated step that can run in CI/CD or as an observability-platform capability, synthesizing an explicit, analyzable model from artifacts teams already have (e.g., distributed traces, service-mesh telemetry, configs/manifests) - providing an accessible gateway for teams to begin resilience testing. As a proof by instance on the DeathStarBench Social Network, we extract the dependency graph from Jaeger and estimate availability across two deployment modes and five failure rates. The discovered model closely tracks live fault-injection results; with replication, median error at mid-range failure rates is near zero, while no-replication shows signed biases consistent with excluded mechanisms. These results create two opportunities: first, to triage and reduce the scope of expensive chaos experiments in advance, and second, to generate real-time signals on the system's resilience posture as its topology evolves, preserving live validation for the most critical or ambiguous scenarios."}

Our key idea is to iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning.

While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement.

Although there has been work on accelerating LLM inference, these approaches are not tailored to the specific characteristics of code generation; instead, they treat code the same as natural language sequences and ignore its unique syntax and semantic characteristics, which are also crucial for improving efficiency. Consequently, these approaches exhibit limited effectiveness in code generation tasks, particularly for repository-level scenarios with considerable complexity and difficulty. To alleviate this issue, following draft-verification paradigm, we propose FastCoder, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for code generation, without compromising the quality of the output. FastCoder constructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft sequences. Moreover, FastCoder reduces the retrieval cost by controlling retrieval timing, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and LLM preference-aware cache.
