We present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule grounding.

Its acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning, posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation (descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal. Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral, phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse substrates."}

We observe that human navigation and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the ongoing dialogue.We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur. Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours arising naturally from any environmental setting."}

We systematically evaluate how reasoning capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary health. Our key finding challenges the \"test-time scaling\" paradigm: while recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence, increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks."}

We propose S3LoRA (Safe Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility metrics and significantly reducing inference cost.

Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast, preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their similarity scores.

BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes. Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization, supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent, client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both solution quality and user satisfaction.

To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment."}

This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result in more cooperative behavior.

We demonstrate that repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure modes, such as unintended \"trap\" states.

With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens. Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall.

In this work, we investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment. Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies.

We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data, training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI. To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries, particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and deployment concentrate value and decision-making.

Our approach accounts for the full stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power, host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead. Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24 Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to warrant important attention.

Notably, each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction, or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals. This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions corresponding to each safety mode.

In humans, conformity arises from informational influence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence (social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by shifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear whether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively disentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated nine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal, investment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70, respectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the models' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently rising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is dramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios, this informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs systematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty triggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models additionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight public signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81)."}

In particular, we examine the case of curriculum development for a novel undergraduate program in AI in engineering. The research uses a mixed methods approach, combining quantitative curriculum mapping with qualitative focus group interviews. In addition to assessing the alignment of the curriculum with the targeted competencies, the study also examines the perceived quality, consistency, practicality and effectiveness from both academic and industry perspectives, as well as differences in perceptions between educators who were involved in the development and those who were not.

Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum, with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline <-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers. Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299 patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG. Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive, highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease progression."}

In this work, we revisit this long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy.

This paper proposes a tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by 96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool (available atthis https URL), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue images.

Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect 1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.

Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced both quality and stability of the results."}

This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes, where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps."}

TAIGen produces adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on green and blue channels.

To address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction (CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation; and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask, harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.

There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought, but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding, to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which typically require millions or billions of training examples.

Our analysis reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy, where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived \"wormhole\" solution.

In this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel, domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text extraction.Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats (e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate, standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting inconsistencies.We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+ (133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably, Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to +12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines, while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among open math pretraining corpora.

We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system.

Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types.

Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem, which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods offering global guarantees."}

However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1) the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction (all $p < .01$) compared to current practice.

However, when interacting with untrusted data sources (e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI). Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness, they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security, which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents' task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph (TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.

Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and generalizability.

To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and 28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and performance.

Although 3DGS compression methods have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks. This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating. Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes.

To overcome these challenges, we propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias, EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends, effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts.

While this technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains largely underexplored.In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters.

However, these methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning attacks.

In many domains, particularly in medicine, the emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial, potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher classification accuracy.

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically, estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%) confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI in medical imaging."}

Previous 3D adversarial attack methods often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin."}

Existing visual compression methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.

Instead, this work focuses on general non-linear settings where agents respond to the decision policy with only \"local information\" of the policy. Moreover, we simultaneously consider the objectives of maximizing decision-maker welfare (model prediction accuracy), social welfare (agent improvement caused by strategic behaviors), and agent welfare (the extent that ML underestimates the agents). We first generalize the agent best response model in previous works to the non-linear setting, then reveal the compatibility of welfare objectives. We show the three welfare can attain the optimum simultaneously only under restrictive conditions which are challenging to achieve in non-linear settings. The theoretical results imply that existing works solely maximizing the welfare of a subset of parties inevitably diminish the welfare of the others.

However, our investigation reveals that the MISO architecture exhibits fundamental limitations in \"Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output\" (MIMO) (e.g., parallel multi-tasks output processing): the architecture generates task mutual exclusion effects, leading to resource contention among different tasks when sharing output channels, and consequently resulting in optimization imbalance and performance degradation. In contrast, human MIMO processing inherently enables concurrent task execution (e.g., while dialogue and decision-making) without interference. Inspired by this, in this work, we propose a unified MIMO training model with parallel multi-tasks output capabilities termed Visual Language Action Model for Simultaneously Chatting and Decision Making. We refer to this method as VLASCD or MIMO-VLA, and in the following, we will use these two names interchangeably. We evaluate the model on the CARLA autonomous driving platform.

However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to copyright infringement attacks, where attackers inject strategically modified non-infringing images into the training set, inducing the model to generate infringing content under the prompt of specific poisoned captions. To address this issue, we first propose a defense framework, CopyrightShield, to defend against the above attack. Specifically, we analyze the memorization mechanism of diffusion models and find that attacks exploit the model's overfitting to specific spatial positions and prompts, causing it to reproduce poisoned samples under backdoor triggers. Based on this, we propose a poisoned sample detection method using spatial masking and data attribution to quantify poisoning risk and accurately identify hidden backdoor samples. To further mitigate memorization of poisoned features, we introduce an adaptive optimization strategy that integrates a dynamic penalty term into the training loss, reducing reliance on infringing features while preserving generative performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CopyrightShield significantly improves poisoned sample detection performance across two attack scenarios, achieving average F1-scores of 0.665, retarding the First-Attack Epoch (FAE) of 115.2% and decreasing the Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) by 56.7%. Compared to the SoTA backdoor defense in diffusion models, the defense effect is improved by about 25%, showcasing its superiority and practicality in enhancing the security of diffusion models."}

Prior work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability, measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly ``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails. Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI systems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior. Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk. APE is available atthis http URL"}

Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance.

Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having \"beliefs\" about its environment, which it \"updates\" in response to sensory input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however, and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved."}

While RL drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025) shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning capabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows a 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on MATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements over the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

In such cases, data scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for explanation purposes."}

Therefore, we introduce Decomposition of Experts (DoE), a novel framework that dynamically identifies and activates task-specific experts within a language model to reduce inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. We first define a task expert as a set of parameters that significantly influence the performance of a specific task and propose a four-step unplug-and-play process: (1) receiving a user request, (2) identifying the corresponding task expert, (3) performing inference using the expert-localized model, and (4) restoring the original model and waiting for the next task. Using attribution methods and prompt tuning, DoE isolates task-relevant neurons, minimizing computational overhead while maintaining task performance. We assume a setting where a language model receives user requests from five widely used natural language understanding benchmarks, processing one task at a time. In this setup, we demonstrate that DoE achieves up to a x1.73 inference speed-up with a 65% pruning rate, without compromising accuracy. Comparisons with various task expert localization methods reveal that DoE effectively identifies task experts, while ablation studies validate the importance of its components. Additionally, we analyze the effects of batch size, token count, and layer types on inference speed-up, providing practical insights for adopting DoE. The proposed framework is both practical and scalable, applicable to any transformer-based architecture, offering a robust solution for efficient task-specific inference."}

We evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness on a challenging custom multimodal dataset comprising of tactile data from a soft pneumatic gripper, and visual data from non-stationary images of objects extracted from video sequences. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study on the custom dataset and the Core50 dataset to highlight the contributions of different components of the algorithm. To further demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we perform a real-time experiment for object classification using the soft gripper and an external independent camera setup, all synchronized with the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework."}

In this paper, we introduce Grounded-VideoLLM, a novel Video-LLM adept at perceiving and reasoning over specific video moments in a fine-grained manner. We identify that current Video-LLMs have limitations for fine-grained video understanding since they lack effective temporal modeling and timestamp representation. In light of this, we sharpen our model by incorporating (1) an additional temporal stream to encode the relationships between frames and (2) discrete temporal tokens enriched with specific time knowledge to represent timestamps. To optimize the training of Grounded-VideoLLM, we employ a multi-stage training scheme, beginning with simple video-captioning tasks and progressively introducing video temporal grounding tasks of increasing complexity. To further enhance Grounded-VideoLLM's temporal reasoning capability, we also curate a grounded VideoQA dataset by an automatic annotation pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grounded-VideoLLM not only excels in fine-grained grounding tasks such as temporal sentence grounding, dense video captioning, and grounded VideoQA, but also shows great potential as a versatile video assistant for general video understanding."}

Previous studies, such as DeepTag and VetTag, evaluated the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate veterinary diagnosis coding, employing long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer models to infer a subset of Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) diagnosis codes from free-text clinical notes. This study expands on these efforts by incorporating all 7,739 distinct SNOMED-CT diagnosis codes recognized by the Colorado State University (CSU) Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) and by leveraging the increasing availability of pre-trained language models (LMs). 13 freely-available pre-trained LMs were fine-tuned on the free-text notes from 246,473 manually-coded veterinary patient visits included in the CSU VTH's electronic health records (EHRs), which resulted in superior performance relative to previous efforts. The most accurate results were obtained when expansive labeled data were used to fine-tune relatively large clinical LMs, but the study also showed that comparable results can be obtained using more limited resources and non-clinical LMs. The results of this study contribute to the improvement of the quality of veterinary EHRs by investigating accessible methods for automated coding and support both animal and human health research by paving the way for more integrated and comprehensive health databases that span species and institutions."}

This implies that race is an attribute sufficiently separable from other attributes to isolate its causal role. But race is embedded in a nexus of social factors that resist isolated treatment. If race is socially constructed, in what sense can it cause worse treatment? Some propose that the perception of race, rather than race itself, causes worse treatment. Others suggest that since causal models require \\textit{modularity}, i.e. the ability to isolate causal effects, attempts to causally model discrimination are misguided.This paper addresses the problem differently. We introduce a framework for reasoning about discrimination, in which race is a high-level \\textit{abstraction} of lower-level features. In this framework, race can be modeled as itself causing worse treatment. Modularity is ensured by allowing assumptions about social construction to be precisely and explicitly stated, via an alignment between race and its constituents. Such assumptions can then be subjected to normative and empirical challenges, which lead to different views of when discrimination occurs. By distinguishing constitutive and causal relations, the abstraction framework pinpoints disagreements in the current literature on modeling discrimination, while preserving a precise causal account of discrimination."}

To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively.

To address this, we propose Self-Supervised Prompt Optimization (SPO), a cost-efficient framework that discovers effective prompts for both closed and open-ended tasks without requiring external reference. Motivated by the observations that prompt quality manifests directly in LLM outputs and LLMs can effectively assess adherence to task requirements, we derive evaluation and optimization signals purely from output comparisons. Specifically, SPO selects superior prompts through pairwise output comparisons evaluated by an LLM evaluator, followed by an LLM optimizer that aligns outputs with task requirements.

However, existing single-setup protocols often lack support for dynamic user participation and do not provide strong privacy guarantees such as forward and backward secrecy. \\par In this paper, we present a novel secure aggregation protocol that requires only a single setup for the entire FL training.

To address this issue, inspired by human reverse thinking, we propose Ontology-Guided Reverse Thinking (ORT), a novel framework that constructs reasoning paths from purposes back to conditions. ORT operates in three key phases: (1) using LLM to extract purpose labels and condition labels, (2) constructing label reasoning paths based on the KG ontology, and (3) using the label reasoning paths to guide knowledge retrieval.

Differentiating between a text written by a human and one generated by an LLM has become almost impossible. Information-hiding techniques such as digital watermarking or steganography can help by embedding information inside text in a form that is unlikely to be noticed. However, existing techniques, such as linguistic-based or format-based methods, change the semantics or cannot be applied to pure, unformatted text. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for information hiding called Innamark, which can conceal any byte-encoded sequence within a sufficiently long cover text. This method is implemented as a multi-platform library using the Kotlin programming language, which is accompanied by a command-line tool and a web interface. By substituting conventional whitespace characters with visually similar Unicode whitespace characters, our proposed scheme preserves the semantics of the cover text without changing the number of characters. Furthermore, we propose a specified structure for secret messages that enables configurable compression, encryption, hashing, and error correction. An experimental benchmark comparison on a dataset of 1 000 000 Wikipedia articles compares ten algorithms. The results demonstrate the robustness of our proposed Innamark method in various applications and the imperceptibility of its watermarks to humans. We discuss the limits to the embedding capacity and robustness of the algorithm and how these could be addressed in future work."}

While prior work has primarily focused on refining scoring functions and adjusting test-time thresholds, such algorithmic improvements offer only incremental gains. We argue that a rethinking of the entire development lifecycle is needed to mitigate these risks effectively. This work addresses two overlooked dimensions of OoD detection in object detection. First, we reveal fundamental flaws in widely used evaluation benchmarks: contrary to their design intent, up to 13% of objects in the OoD test sets actually belong to in-distribution classes, and vice versa. These quality issues severely distort the reported performance of existing methods and contribute to their high false positive rates. Second, we introduce a novel training-time mitigation paradigm that operates independently of external OoD detectors. Instead of relying solely on post-hoc scoring, we fine-tune the detector using a carefully synthesized OoD dataset that semantically resembles in-distribution objects. This process shapes a defensive decision boundary by suppressing objectness on OoD objects, leading to a 91% reduction in hallucination error of a YOLO model on BDD-100K. Our methodology generalizes across detection paradigms such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR, and supports few-shot adaptation.

Yet, these approaches assume perfect execution from low-level policies, which is unrealistic in real-world environments with noise or suboptimal behaviors. To overcome this, we fully discard the pretrained low-level policy and instead use the LLM to directly generate executable code plans within a closed-loop framework. Our planner employs chain-of-thought (CoT)-guided few-shot learning with incrementally structured examples to produce robust and generalizable task plans. Complementing this, a reporter evaluates outcomes using RGB-D and delivers structured feedback, enabling recovery from misalignment and replanning under partial observability. This design eliminates per-step inference, reduces computational overhead, and limits error accumulation that was observed in previous methods.

Social media platforms amplify the impact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but also across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a multimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social media platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly spreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a challenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio, and visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce MuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of $\\approx$ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose an innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contributions of textual, vocal, and visual modalities to the classification of content as either sexist or non-sexist; and (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection. We find that visual information plays a key role in labeling sexist content for both humans and models. Models effectively detect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with implicit cases, such as stereotypes, instances where annotators also show low agreement. This highlights the inherent difficulty of the task, as identifying implicit sexism depends on the social and cultural context."}

In the literature, this task is formulated either as metric clustering over pre-trained text embeddings or as graph clustering based on pairwise similarities derived from an oracle, e.g., a large machine learning model. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved this field by providing high-quality contextualized embeddings and accurate semantic similarity estimates. However, leveraging LLMs at scale introduces substantial computational and financial costs due to the large number of required API queries or inference calls. To address this issue, we propose Cequel, a cost-effective framework that achieves accurate text clustering under a limited budget of LLM queries. At its core, Cequel constructs must-link and cannot-link constraints by selectively querying LLMs on informative text pairs or triplets, identified via our proposed algorithms, EdgeLLM and TriangleLLM. These constraints are then utilized in a weighted constrained clustering algorithm to form high-quality clusters. Specifically, EdgeLLM and TriangleLLM employ carefully designed greedy selection strategies and prompting techniques to identify and extract informative constraints efficiently. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Cequel consistently outperforms existing methods in unsupervised text clustering under the same query budget."}

State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based, but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning. Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum multiple individual rewards, \\eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches. Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to 300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark, outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin. Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is the best learning-based approach on nuPlan.

The impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself.We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how to quantify the creation of overconfident or intuitive responses-the signature of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, the idealized unconstrained reasoning strictly preserves semantic content.By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in departures from truthfulness, semantic information conservation, revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality-we offer a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems.

We aim to accelerate the spatiotemporal regularization process for this class of inverse problems to enable real-time imaging. In this approach, a neural operator maps each pattern on the right-hand side of the scattering equation to its affiliated regularization parameter. The network is trained in two steps which entails: (1) training on low-resolution regularization maps furnished by the Morozov discrepancy principle with nonoptimal thresholds, and (2) optimizing network predictions through minimization of the Tikhonov loss function regulated by the validation loss. Step 2 allows for tailoring of the approximate maps of Step 1 toward construction of higher quality images. This approach enables direct learning from test data and dispenses with the need for a-priori knowledge of the optimal regularization maps. The network, trained on low-resolution data, quickly generates dense regularization maps for high-resolution imaging. We highlight the importance of the training loss function on the network's generalizability. In particular, we demonstrate that networks informed by the logic of discrepancy principle lead to images of higher contrast. In this case, the training process involves many-objective optimization. We propose a new method to adaptively select the appropriate loss weights during training without requiring an additional optimization process.

While modern approaches are dominated by large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic, iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. This paper presents a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic attention mechanism. The experiments chart the impact of architectural enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, the final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several foundational benchmarks and validating the iterative design process.

We introduce STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of wrong tokens.

Traditionally, FSMs are implemented by hardware engineers through Verilog coding, which is often tedious and time-consuming. Recently, with the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, LLMs have been increasingly explored for automating Verilog code generation. However, LLM-generated Verilog code often suffers from security vulnerabilities, which is particularly concerning for security-sensitive FSM implementations. To address this issue, we propose SecFSM, a novel method that leverages a security-oriented knowledge graph to guide LLMs in generating more secure Verilog code. Specifically, we first construct a FSM Security Knowledge Graph (FSKG) as an external aid to LLMs. Subsequently, we analyze users' requirements to identify vulnerabilities and get a list of vulnerabilities in the requirements. Then, we retrieve knowledge from FSKG based on the vulnerabilities list. Finally, we construct security prompts based on the security knowledge for Verilog code generation. To evaluate SecFSM, we build a dedicated dataset collected from academic datasets, artificial datasets, papers, and industrial cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecFSM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Spikes lower beta2 toward beta2_min; calm phases keep it near beta2_max. Options include leaky-AMSGrad (decay), trust-region clipping (max_ratio), adaptive tiny terms, and several bias-correction modes ``none'', ``beta2max'', ``exact').

Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance.

These arise due to the high variability in power consumption during the training. Given the synchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a computation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a communication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because compute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large power swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with the increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from the frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical frequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid infrastructure. Therefore, to continue scaling AI training workloads safely, we need to stabilize the power of such workloads. This paper introduces the challenge with production data and explores innovative solutions across the stack: software, GPU hardware, and datacenter infrastructure.

To address these limitations, we propose a unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably, each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction, or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals. This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented fine-grained control.

Existing multilingual benchmarks are predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence, truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native entities are introduced across various languages."}

Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

To resolve this issue, we propose Universal Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual systems."}

To tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation (CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens.

Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple experimental setups to assess their effectiveness.

KGs are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements. Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank (MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset, different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized score ($M_i \\in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models."}

These findings also provide practical insights for future improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and performance.

However, existing methods rely on static drafting lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or improving BLEU and ROUGE scores.

Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text, formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe \"bigger vocabularies help\" as \"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps,\" providing a simple, principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics that govern language-model scaling in pre-training."}

However, symbolic narrative graphs often suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109 dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs. Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative understanding."}

Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond modest computational investments.

Unlike previous approaches that rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents, FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting, requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate documents.

Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree, Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning."}

The current approach is to design a memory module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments, with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase, MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its practical value."}

However, when interacting with untrusted data sources (e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI). Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness, they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security, which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents' task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph (TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments."}

Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task, enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings.

This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language experience and the association between children's production and their input. In both the most commonly used \\gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\\%, potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof solution.

However, recent studies have revealed that certain neurons play disproportionately important roles in solving specific tasks, suggesting that task-relevant substructures can be isolated and selectively activated for each task. Therefore, we introduce Decomposition of Experts (DoE), a novel framework that dynamically identifies and activates task-specific experts within a language model to reduce inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. We first define a task expert as a set of parameters that significantly influence the performance of a specific task and propose a four-step unplug-and-play process: (1) receiving a user request, (2) identifying the corresponding task expert, (3) performing inference using the expert-localized model, and (4) restoring the original model and waiting for the next task. Using attribution methods and prompt tuning, DoE isolates task-relevant neurons, minimizing computational overhead while maintaining task performance. We assume a setting where a language model receives user requests from five widely used natural language understanding benchmarks, processing one task at a time. In this setup, we demonstrate that DoE achieves up to a x1.73 inference speed-up with a 65% pruning rate, without compromising accuracy. Comparisons with various task expert localization methods reveal that DoE effectively identifies task experts, while ablation studies validate the importance of its components. Additionally, we analyze the effects of batch size, token count, and layer types on inference speed-up, providing practical insights for adopting DoE. The proposed framework is both practical and scalable, applicable to any transformer-based architecture, offering a robust solution for efficient task-specific inference."}

Despite its significance, the broad nature of this term has led to inconsistencies in understanding conceptualization across various works, as there exists different types of instances that can be abstracted in a wide variety of ways. There is also a lack of a systematic overview that comprehensively examines existing works on the definition, execution, and application of conceptualization to enhance reasoning tasks. In this paper, we address these gaps by first proposing a categorization of different types of conceptualizations into four levels based on the types of instances being conceptualized, in order to clarify the term and define the scope of our work. Then, we present the first comprehensive survey of over 150 papers, surveying various definitions, resources, methods, and downstream applications related to conceptualization into a unified taxonomy, with a focus on the entity and event levels.

Motivated by the observations that prompt quality manifests directly in LLM outputs and LLMs can effectively assess adherence to task requirements, we derive evaluation and optimization signals purely from output comparisons. Specifically, SPO selects superior prompts through pairwise output comparisons evaluated by an LLM evaluator, followed by an LLM optimizer that aligns outputs with task requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, achieving comparable or superior results with significantly lower costs (e.g., 1.1% to 5.6% of existing methods) and fewer samples (e.g., three samples).

We show that, across all modes, Pub-Guard-LLM consistently surpasses the performance of various baselines and provides more reliable explanations, namely explanations which are deemed more relevant and coherent than those generated by the baselines when evaluated by multiple assessment methods. By enhancing both detection performance and explainability in scientific fraud detection, Pub-Guard-LLM contributes to safeguarding research integrity with a novel, effective, open-source tool."}

Addressing these, we propose a systematic statistical approach to assess bias in MLMs, using mixed models to account for random effects, pseudo-perplexity weights for sentences derived from templates and quantify bias using statistical effect sizes. Replicating prior studies, we match on bias scores in magnitude and direction with small to medium effect sizes. Next, we explore the novel problem of gender bias in the context of $\\emph{personality}$ and $\\textit{character}$ traits, across seven MLMs (base and large). We find that MLMs vary; ALBERT is unbiased for binary gender but the most biased for non-binary $\\textit{neo}$, while RoBERTa-large is the most biased for binary gender but shows small to no bias for $\\textit{neo}$. There is some alignment of MLM bias and findings in psychology (human perspective) - in $\\textit{agreeableness}$ with RoBERTa-large and $\\textit{emotional stability}$ with BERT-large. There is general agreement for the remaining 3 personality dimensions: both sides observe at most small differences across gender.

The acquisition of such data from vulnerable populations, such as children, is challenging due to ethical, legal and technical barriers. Moreover, the creation of these datasets relies heavily on human annotation, which not only strains resources but also raises significant concerns due to annotators exposure to harmful content. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and labels. Our experiments demonstrate that synthetic data enables BERT-based CB classifiers to achieve performance close to that of those trained on fully authentic datasets (75.8% vs. 81.5% accuracy). Additionally, LLMs can effectively label authentic yet unlabeled data, allowing BERT classifiers to attain a comparable performance level (79.1% vs. 81.5% accuracy). These results highlight the potential of LLMs as a scalable, ethical, and cost-effective solution for generating data for CB detection."}

However, LLMs' unethical output and their capability of detecting toxicity have primarily been tested on language data that do not demand complex meaning inference, such as the biased associations of 'he' with programmer and 'she' with household. Nowadays toxic language adopts a much more creative range of implicit forms, thanks to advanced censorship. In this study, we collect authentic toxic interactions that evade online censorship and that are verified by human annotators as inference-intensive. To evaluate and improve LLMs' reasoning of the authentic implicit toxic language, we propose a new prompting method, Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC), drawn on interdisciplinary findings from cognitive science and linguistics. The PIC prompting significantly improves the success rate of GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, DeepSeek-v2.5, and DeepSeek-v3 in identifying implicit toxic language, compared to five baseline prompts, such as CoT and rule-based baselines. In addition, it also facilitates the models to produce more explicit and coherent reasoning processes, hence can potentially be generalized to other inference-intensive tasks, e.g., understanding humour and metaphors."}

Existing approaches highlight which sensor events are most important for each predicted activity, using simple rules to convert these events into natural language explanations for non-expert users.

With the recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is worth exploring whether they can enhance explanation generation, considering their proven knowledge of human activities. This paper investigates potential approaches to combine XAI and LLMs for sensor-based ADL recognition.

Social media platforms amplify the impact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but also across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a multimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social media platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly spreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a challenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio, and visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce MuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of $\\approx$ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose an innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contributions of textual, vocal, and visual modalities to the classification of content as either sexist or non-sexist; and (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection.

However, leveraging LLMs at scale introduces substantial computational and financial costs due to the large number of required API queries or inference calls. To address this issue, we propose Cequel, a cost-effective framework that achieves accurate text clustering under a limited budget of LLM queries. At its core, Cequel constructs must-link and cannot-link constraints by selectively querying LLMs on informative text pairs or triplets, identified via our proposed algorithms, EdgeLLM and TriangleLLM. These constraints are then utilized in a weighted constrained clustering algorithm to form high-quality clusters. Specifically, EdgeLLM and TriangleLLM employ carefully designed greedy selection strategies and prompting techniques to identify and extract informative constraints efficiently.

We argue that this stems from limited exploration of the web environment and insufficient exploitation of pre-trained web knowledge in LLMs. To improve the performance of self-improvement, we propose a novel framework that introduces a co-evolving World Model LLM. This world model predicts the next observation based on the current observation and action within the web environment. Leveraging LLMs' pretrained knowledge of abundant web content, the World Model serves dual roles: (1) as a virtual web server generating self-instructed training data to continuously refine the agent's policy, and (2) as an imagination engine during inference, enabling look-ahead simulation to guide action selection for the agent LLM. Experiments in real-world web environments (Mind2Web-Live, WebVoyager, and GAIA-web) show a 10% performance gain over existing self-evolving agents, demonstrating the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, without using any distillation from more powerful close-sourced models.

In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output length without any external control."}

This issue is especially acute in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize to other structured step-wise generation tasks."}

Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory knowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and explanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated by legal experts.

While Small Language Models (SLMs) still struggle at this task, tool-augmented multi-step agents perform better, at the cost of relying on closed-source or larger models, external data, or extensive prompt-engineering. This work introduces MATATA, a novel weakly supervised end-to-end approach to train multi-step reasoning language agents for document tabular applications. MATATA presents an annotation-free paradigm for each agent to enhance 3.8B/8B SLMs. During its two-stage training, MATATA uses the final outcome of the multi-step reasoning chain as weak supervision. This approach avoids having to individually supervise each intermediate agent in the reasoning chain. By employing an adaptive planner and shared tools across different datasets, MATATA shows robust performance. Experiments demonstrate that MATATA achieves state-of-the-art on FinQA, and on TAT-QA among reasoning methods based on open-source SLMs. Although being SLM-based, MATATA closely matches GPT-4-based frameworks on TabMWP. This novel weakly supervised approach enables training an end-to-end multi-step reasoning agent without intermediate supervision, supporting future developments of cost-effective powerful agentic systems."}

Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation."}

Alignment targets to improve win rate of a sample from the aligned model against the base model. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. We show that this train/test mismatch makes standard RLHF framework sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. To this end, we propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (InfAlign), which aims to optimize inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the base model. We prove that for any inference-time decoding procedure, the optimal aligned policy is the solution to the standard RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the calibrate-and-transform RL (InfAlign-CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. For best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, we propose specific transformations offering up to 3-8% improvement on inference-time win rates.

To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines.

The impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself.We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how to quantify the creation of overconfident or intuitive responses-the signature of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, the idealized unconstrained reasoning strictly preserves semantic content.By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in departures from truthfulness, semantic information conservation, revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality-we offer a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems.

We compare the performance of different LLMs and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating agents.

This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks.

Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance.

While RL drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025) shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning capabilities of the student model.

Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for the full S&P 500 and beyond."}

To address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction (CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation; and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask, harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.

While image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure) using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh surface.

Most existing methods adopt a first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision. Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes. Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance."}

Basketball, in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field, as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for each player.

However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance, with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers, forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding, while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting, certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future research."}

Although 3DGS compression methods have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks. This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.

However, these decoupling strategies overlook background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near, middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation. Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors, whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.

To address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches, achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details, resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques."}

To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning. AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion.

The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components, AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features, reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details.

Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time.

ATLAS outperforms existing methods by fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture complex poses compared to linear models."}

In this work, we address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture. Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval; (ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass; (iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach.

However, their global denoising process inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer. VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based methods by 30\\%+ higher GPT-Balance score.

In this work, we introduce a scalable group inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity (binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples."}

The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we propose dedicated variants tailored to each.

Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.

Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum, with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline <-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers. Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299 patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG. Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive, highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease progression."}

Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot, demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments."}

Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these, we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing high-frequency structure reconstruction.

DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters.

Propagation-based phase contrast is particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando (tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach, as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations.

To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

Freire", "title": "Are Virtual DES Images a Valid Alternative to the Real Ones?", "abstract": "Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial, potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes clinically viable."}

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically, estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%) confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI in medical imaging."}

However, generating road network poses a significant challenge due to the conflicting underlying combination of Euclidean (e.g., road landmarks location) and non-Euclidean (e.g., road topological connectivity) structures. Existing methods struggle to merge the two types of data domains effectively, but few of them address it properly. Instead, our work establishes a unified representation of both types of data domain by projecting both Euclidean and non-Euclidean data into an integer series called RoadNet Sequence. Further than modeling an auto-regressive sequence-to-sequence Transformer model to understand RoadNet Sequence, we decouple the dependency of RoadNet Sequence into a mixture of auto-regressive and non-autoregressive dependency. Building on this, our proposed non-autoregressive sequence-to-sequence approach leverages non-autoregressive dependencies while fixing the gap towards auto-regressive dependencies, resulting in success in both efficiency and accuracy. We further identify two main bottlenecks in the current RoadNetTransformer on a non-overfitting split of the dataset: poor landmark detection limited by the BEV Encoder and error propagation to topology reasoning. Therefore, we propose Topology-Inherited Training to inherit better topology knowledge into RoadNetTransformer. Additionally, we collect SD-Maps from open-source map datasets and use this prior information to significantly improve landmark detection and reachability. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the superiority of RoadNet Sequence representation and the non-autoregressive approach compared to existing state-of-the-art alternatives."}

However, the high-speed movement of UAVs and targets introduces unique challenges, including real-time processing demands and severe motion blur, which degrade the performance of existing generic trackers. While single-stream vision transformer (ViT) architectures have shown promise in visual tracking, their computational inefficiency and lack of UAV-specific optimizations limit their practicality in this domain. In this paper, we boost the efficiency of this framework by tailoring it into an adaptive computation framework that dynamically exits Transformer blocks for real-time UAV tracking. The motivation behind this is that tracking tasks with fewer challenges can be adequately addressed using low-level feature representations. Simpler tasks can often be handled with less demanding, lower-level features. This approach allows the model use computational resources more efficiently by focusing on complex tasks and conserving resources for easier ones. Another significant enhancement introduced in this paper is the improved effectiveness of ViTs in handling motion blur, a common issue in UAV tracking caused by the fast movements of either the UAV, the tracked objects, or both. This is achieved by acquiring motion blur robust representations through enforcing invariance in the feature representation of the target with respect to simulated motion blur. We refer to our proposed approach as BDTrack. Extensive experiments conducted on four tracking benchmarks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach, demonstrating its potential as a practical and effective approach for real-time UAV tracking.

However, there still lacks a systematic understanding of the adversarial robustness of AIGI detectors. In this paper, we examine the vulnerability of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors against adversarial attack under white-box and black-box settings, which has been rarely investigated so far. To this end, we propose a new method to attack AIGI detectors. First, inspired by the obvious difference between real images and fake images in the frequency domain, we add perturbations under the frequency domain to push the image away from its original frequency distribution. Second, we explore the full posterior distribution of the surrogate model to further narrow this gap between heterogeneous AIGI detectors, e.g. transferring adversarial examples across CNNs and ViTs. This is achieved by introducing a novel post-train Bayesian strategy that turns a single surrogate into a Bayesian one, capable of simulating diverse victim models using one pre-trained surrogate, without the need for re-training. We name our method as Frequency-based Post-train Bayesian Attack, or FPBA. Through FPBA, we show that adversarial attack is truly a real threat to AIGI detectors, because FPBA can deliver successful black-box attacks across models, generators, defense methods, and even evade cross-generator detection, which is a crucial real-world detection scenario.

Since generated image quality is challenging to measure and compare directly, RouteT2I establishes multi-dimensional quality metrics, particularly, by evaluating the similarity between the generated images and both positive and negative texts that describe each specific quality metric. RouteT2I then predicts the expected quality of the generated images by identifying key tokens in the prompt and comparing their impact on the quality. RouteT2I further introduces the Pareto relative superiority to compare the multi-metric quality of the generated images. Based on this comparison and predefined cost constraints, RouteT2I allocates prompts to either the edge or the cloud.

HART includes a novel attention mechanism that incorporates the following components: 1) The Dense Attention Kernel (DAK) maps the attention weight distribution into a high-dimensional space over (0, +$\\infty$). By removing the upper bound constraint on attention weights, DAK enables more flexible modeling of complex feature interactions. This reduces feature collinearity. 2) The Multi Kernel & Order Interaction (MKOI) module extends the attention mechanism by unifying semantic and spatial knowledge learning.

However, these models cannot be used for tasks that contain ambiguity or require user instruction. These tasks necessitate an embedding model which outputs can use a natural language instruction to control the representation of a visual embedding. Existing CLIP-based approaches embed images and text independently, and fuse the result. We find that this results in weak interactions between modalities, and poor user control over the representation. We introduce ABC, an open-source multimodal embedding model that uses a vision-language model backbone to deeply integrate image features with natural language instructions. ABC achieves best-for-size performance on MSCOCO image-to-text retrieval and is the top performing model on classification and VQA tasks in the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark. With a strongly unified vision-language representation, ABC can use natural language to solve subtle and potentially ambiguous visual retrieval problems. To evaluate this capability, we design CtrlBench, a benchmark that requires interleaving textual instructions with image content for correct retrieval. ABC advances the state of visual embeddings, outputting high-quality visual representations with natural language control. Our model and datasets are available at our project page:this https URL"}

While prior work has primarily focused on refining scoring functions and adjusting test-time thresholds, such algorithmic improvements offer only incremental gains. We argue that a rethinking of the entire development lifecycle is needed to mitigate these risks effectively. This work addresses two overlooked dimensions of OoD detection in object detection. First, we reveal fundamental flaws in widely used evaluation benchmarks: contrary to their design intent, up to 13% of objects in the OoD test sets actually belong to in-distribution classes, and vice versa. These quality issues severely distort the reported performance of existing methods and contribute to their high false positive rates. Second, we introduce a novel training-time mitigation paradigm that operates independently of external OoD detectors. Instead of relying solely on post-hoc scoring, we fine-tune the detector using a carefully synthesized OoD dataset that semantically resembles in-distribution objects. This process shapes a defensive decision boundary by suppressing objectness on OoD objects, leading to a 91% reduction in hallucination error of a YOLO model on BDD-100K. Our methodology generalizes across detection paradigms such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR, and supports few-shot adaptation. Together, these contributions offer a principled and effective way to reduce OoD-induced hallucination in object detectors. Code and data are available at:this https URL."}

Since design is intrinsically an iterative and subjective process, flexible editability is also in high demand for practical usage. While current models have served as assistants to human designers in various design tasks, they typically handle only segments of the creative design process or produce pixel-based outputs that limit editability. This paper introduces a training-free framework for fully automated banner ad design creation, enabling frontier multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to streamline the production of effective banners with minimal manual effort across diverse marketing contexts. We present BannerAgency, an MLLM agent system that collaborates with advertisers to understand their brand identity and banner objectives, generates matching background images, creates blueprints for foreground design elements, and renders the final creatives as editable components in Figma or SVG formats rather than static pixels. To facilitate evaluation and future research, we introduce BannerRequest400, a benchmark featuring 100 unique logos paired with 400 diverse banner requests.

Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves a target image from a gallery based on an image-level description, while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes a target object within a given image using an instance-level description. However, real-world applications often present more complex demands. Users typically query an instance-level description across a large gallery and expect to receive both relevant image and the corresponding instance location. In such scenarios, TIR struggles with fine-grained descriptions and object-level localization, while REC is limited in its ability to efficiently search large galleries and lacks an effective ranking mechanism. In this paper, we introduce a new task called \\textbf{Referring Expression Instance Retrieval (REIR)}, which supports both instance-level retrieval and localization based on fine-grained referring expressions. First, we propose a large-scale benchmark for REIR, named REIRCOCO, constructed by prompting advanced vision-language models to generate high-quality referring expressions for instances in the MSCOCO and RefCOCO datasets. Second, we present a baseline method, Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment with Relation Experts (CLARE), which employs a dual-stream architecture to address REIR in an end-to-end manner. Given a referring expression, the textual branch encodes it into a query embedding. The visual branch detects candidate objects and extracts their instance-level visual features. The most similar candidate to the query is selected for bounding box prediction. CLARE is first trained on object detection and REC datasets to establish initial grounding capabilities, then optimized via Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for improved retrieval across images.

EAFNet integrates a pre-alignment subnetwork that aligns features across varying exposures, ensuring robust feature extraction for subsequent fusion, an asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork that emphasizes reference-based attention to effectively merge these features across exposures, and a reconstruction subnetwork to mitigate ghosting artifacts and preserve fine details.

The experiments chart the impact of architectural enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, the final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several foundational benchmarks and validating the iterative design process. This work provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks."}

This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an expected increase in the rate of hallucinations."}

While recent inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit.

This makes it difficult to distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks), their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for more robust multimodal evaluation."}

However, most simulation environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation, these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA), which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in). Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio."}

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically, DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) Dictionary Construction - to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from normal reference images. (2) Dictionary Lookup - to retrieve queried region features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) Query Discrimination Regularization - to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods."}

However, they remain underutilized in medical imaging, a field crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. This is primarily due to the high computational cost associated with (1) the use of large number of time steps (e.g., 1,000) in diffusion processes and (2) the increased dimensionality of medical images, which are often 3D or 4D. Training a diffusion model on medical images typically takes days to weeks, while sampling each image volume takes minutes to hours. To address this challenge, we introduce Fast-DDPM, a simple yet effective approach capable of improving training speed, sampling speed, and generation quality simultaneously. Unlike DDPM, which trains the image denoiser across 1,000 time steps, Fast-DDPM trains and samples using only 10 time steps. The key to our method lies in aligning the training and sampling procedures to optimize time-step utilization. Specifically, we introduced two efficient noise schedulers with 10 time steps: one with uniform time step sampling and another with non-uniform sampling.

However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training. Our method enables the next generation of cobots to be rapidly deployed with easy-to-set-up, vision-based risk assessment, proactively safeguarding humans and detecting misaligned parts or missing objects before failures occur.

NucleiMix operates in two phases. In the first phase, it identifies candidate locations similar to the surroundings of rare-type nuclei and inserts rare-type nuclei into the candidate locations. In the second phase, it employs a progressive inpainting strategy using a pre-trained diffusion model to seamlessly integrate rare-type nuclei into their new environments in replacement of major-type nuclei or background locations.

The results demonstrate the superior ability of NucleiMix to synthesize realistic rare-type nuclei and to enhance the quality of nuclei segmentation and classification in an accurate and robust manner."}

Physics-driven (PD) network models have gained prominence for this task by integrating data-consistency mechanisms with learned priors, enabling improved performance over purely data-driven approaches. However, reconstruction quality still hinges on the network's ability to disentangle artifacts from true anatomical signals-both of which exhibit complex, multi-scale contextual structure. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture local correlations but often struggle with non-local dependencies. While transformers aim to alleviate this limitation, practical implementations involve design compromises to reduce computational cost by balancing local and non-local sensitivity, occasionally resulting in performance comparable to CNNs. To address these challenges, we propose MambaRoll, a novel physics-driven autoregressive state space model (SSM) for high-fidelity and efficient image reconstruction. MambaRoll employs an unrolled architecture where each cascade autoregressively predicts finer-scale feature maps conditioned on coarser-scale representations, enabling consistent multi-scale context propagation. Each stage is built on a hierarchy of scale-specific PD-SSM modules that capture spatial dependencies while enforcing data consistency through residual correction. To further improve scale-aware learning, we introduce a Deep Multi-Scale Decoding (DMSD) loss, which provides supervision at intermediate spatial scales in alignment with the autoregressive design. Demonstrations on accelerated MRI and sparse-view CT reconstructions show that MambaRoll consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-, transformer-, and SSM-based methods."}

The selection of predictors is crucial, strongly impacting both model accuracy and how well the predictions reflect ecological patterns. To ensure meaningful insights, input variables must be carefully chosen to match the study objectives and the ecological requirements of the target species. However, existing SDMs, including both traditional and deep learning-based approaches, often lack key capabilities for variable selection: (i) flexibility to choose relevant predictors at inference without retraining; (ii) robustness to handle missing predictor values without compromising accuracy; and (iii) explainability to interpret and accurately quantify each predictor's contribution. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MaskSDM, a novel deep learning-based SDM that enables flexible predictor selection by employing a masked training strategy. This approach allows the model to make predictions with arbitrary subsets of input variables while remaining robust to missing data. It also provides a clearer understanding of how adding or removing a given predictor affects model performance and predictions. Additionally, MaskSDM leverages Shapley values for precise predictor contribution assessments, improving upon traditional approximations. We evaluate MaskSDM on the global sPlotOpen dataset, modeling the distributions of 12,738 plant species. Our results show that MaskSDM outperforms imputation-based methods and approximates models trained on specific subsets of variables. These findings underscore MaskSDM's potential to increase the applicability and adoption of SDMs, laying the groundwork for developing foundation models in SDMs that can be readily applied to diverse ecological applications."}

Finally, we reduce the task of recovering the sensor extrinsics to a minimization problem. We show that both translational and rotational Sensor-to-Sensor errors can be solved accurately by our method.

We introduce Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty.

The layer-freezing technique has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs. To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution. To improve training accuracy, we propose \\textit{similarity-aware channel augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \\textit{progressive compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their application for efficient DNN training."}

Therefore, recent efforts have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that attains the standard convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$ under less restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers."}

To explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy, where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived \"wormhole\" solution. The wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut learning.

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However, greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this, we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal."}

We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance. We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system.

SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without degrading overall model quality.

While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary signals in alternative attribution perspectives.To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning (MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g., CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6% increase in ROI (Return on Investment)."}

Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem, which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods offering global guarantees."}

Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models. Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data."}

While the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree, Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning."}

The proposed framework identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure, Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical insights into model behavior.

In practice, SBI is often hindered by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting, requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators, while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging, misspecified environments."}

In these applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However, they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters, thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively capturing anomaly information.

While numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language experience and the association between children's production and their input. In both the most commonly used \\gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\\%, potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates."}

Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative approach based on certified training (which requires neural network verification during training)."}

Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms, reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third, to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth, we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex, high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of spatially varying heat sources.

A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task. On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time.

Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have obtained limited quantization.

In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight, audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the generative paradigm."}

Wright", "title": "Personalized Recommendations via Active Utility-based Pairwise Sampling", "abstract": "Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary, task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second, an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm for personalized ranking."}

The performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as possible.  Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more than doubled with this denoising processing."}

To date, this threat has been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic, large-scale evaluation.We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering 10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini, achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\\%. We find that more capable models are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for unauthorized operation.

Despite significant advances in data collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited. This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics (AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana specimens.

Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced both quality and stability of the results."}

Machine learning-based super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla, Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference (vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%), a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement (vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%).

While deep learning-based accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI."}

Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself.

Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction (CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation; and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask, harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.

There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought, but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding, to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which typically require millions or billions of training examples.

The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence (prediction $\\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as equalized odds; prediction $\\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned on the prediction $\\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$) and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter, thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart, $\\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time, with linear-time approximations also available.

In this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel, domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text extraction.Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats (e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate, standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting inconsistencies.We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+ (133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably, Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to +12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines, while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among open math pretraining corpora.

In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint. Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing, communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance."}

Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

In this work, we identify two key principles underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle, the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static vocabulary pruning."}

However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods, such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective. However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially, we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models, including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling steps."}

Semantic IDs, derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap, where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ), a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal reconstruction loss.

The generated configurations show strong agreement with key thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous, temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are scale-invariant. This \"train-small, generate-large\" capability establishes a new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit.

However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast, preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks."}

To obtain such models from limited data, current works exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task. This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge. The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for efficient parameter marginalization are derived.

Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text, formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe \"bigger vocabularies help\" as \"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps,\" providing a simple, principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics that govern language-model scaling in pre-training."}

Evaluation results show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency, up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast, state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable, and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader adoption across scientific applications."}

Using random matrix theory, we derive exact expressions of the asymptotic prediction risk, thereby enabling the characterization of three evaluation metrics of generalization performance in continual learning: average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer.

To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment."}

As concerns over data privacy and regulatory compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However, integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and robust federated unlearning mechanisms."}

Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank.

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically, estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%) confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI in medical imaging."}

While prior work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment. Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices.

However, learned policies often still lack reliability and exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e. they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency. However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach, Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger manipulation."}

We develop theoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this \"fuzziness\" when estimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules.

We evaluate CREMA on benchmark datasets and real-world clinical environments, including deployment scenarios with significant distribution shifts. CREMA outperforms supervised baselines and existing self-supervised models in both linear probing and fine-tuning evaluations. Notably, it maintains superior performance across diverse clinical domains, such as emergency care, highlighting its robustness under real-world conditions. These results demonstrate that CREMA serves as a scalable and reliable foundation model for ECG diagnostics, supporting downstream applications across heterogeneous and high-risk clinical settings."}

Our training procedure is conservative, has low stochasticity, is solvable with open-source solvers, and is scalable to large industrial deployments. We provide out-of-sample performance guarantees, show that hard convex physical constraints can be enforced in the training program, and propose a mixed-integer convex post-training verification program to evaluate model stability. WaDiRo-SCNN aims to make neural networks safer for critical applications, such as in the energy sector. Finally, we numerically demonstrate our model's performance through both a synthetic experiment and a real-world power system application, viz., the prediction of hourly energy consumption in non-residential buildings within the context of virtual power plants, and evaluate its stability across standard regression benchmark datasets.

In order to develop such an OPDR method, our central hypothesis is that by analyzing the intrinsic relationship among key parameters during the dimension-reduction map, a quantitative function may be constructed to reveal the correlation between the target (lower) dimensionality and other variables. To demonstrate the hypothesis, this paper first defines a formal measure function to quantify the KNN similarity for a specific vector, then extends the measure into an aggregate accuracy of the global metric spaces, and finally derives a closed-form function between the target (lower) dimensionality and other variables. We incorporate the closed-function into popular dimension-reduction methods, various distance metrics, and embedding models."}

Standard algorithms are often prohibitively expensive for datasets with many variables or samples. This study introduces and validates a heuristic approximation of the VarLiNGAM algorithm to address this scalability problem. The standard VarLiNGAM method relies on an iterative search, recalculating statistical dependencies after each step. Our heuristic modifies this procedure by omitting the iterative refinement. This change permits a one-time precomputation of all necessary statistical values. The algorithmic modification reduces the time complexity from $O(m^3n)$ to $O(m^2n + m^3)$ while keeping the space complexity at $O(m^2)$, where $m$ is the number of variables and $n$ is the number of samples. While an approximation, our approach retains VarLiNGAM's essential structure and empirical reliability. On large-scale financial data with up to 400 variables, our algorithm achieves a 7--13x speedup over the standard implementation and a 4.5x speedup over a GPU-accelerated version. Evaluations across medical imaging, web server monitoring, and finance demonstrate the heuristic's robustness and practical scalability.

However, this requires retraining the model from scratch each time it encounters a new domain. In this paper, we introduce a continual learning algorithm capable of incrementally learning different data modalities by leveraging both class-incremental and domain-incremental learning scenarios in an artificial environment where labeled data is scarce, yet non-iid (independent and identical distribution) unlabeled data from the environment is plentiful. The proposed algorithm is efficient and only requires storing prototypes for each class. We evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness on a challenging custom multimodal dataset comprising of tactile data from a soft pneumatic gripper, and visual data from non-stationary images of objects extracted from video sequences. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study on the custom dataset and the Core50 dataset to highlight the contributions of different components of the algorithm. To further demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we perform a real-time experiment for object classification using the soft gripper and an external independent camera setup, all synchronized with the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework."}

This work introduces MATATA, a novel weakly supervised end-to-end approach to train multi-step reasoning language agents for document tabular applications. MATATA presents an annotation-free paradigm for each agent to enhance 3.8B/8B SLMs. During its two-stage training, MATATA uses the final outcome of the multi-step reasoning chain as weak supervision.

We find that properly regularized networks exhibit a sharp phase transition: complexity rises during memorization, then falls as the network discovers a simpler underlying pattern that generalizes. In contrast, unregularized networks remain trapped in a high-complexity memorization phase. We establish an explicit connection between our complexity measure and generalization bounds, providing a theoretical foundation for the link between lossy compression and generalization. Our framework achieves compression ratios 30-40x better than naÃ¯ve approaches, enabling precise tracking of complexity dynamics.

We show that this train/test mismatch makes standard RLHF framework sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. To this end, we propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (InfAlign), which aims to optimize inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the base model. We prove that for any inference-time decoding procedure, the optimal aligned policy is the solution to the standard RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the calibrate-and-transform RL (InfAlign-CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward.

Therefore, present a deceptive sequential decision-making framework that not only conceals sensitive information, but actively misleads adversaries about it. We model autonomous systems as Markov decision processes, with adversaries using inverse reinforcement learning to recover reward functions. To counter them, we present three regularization strategies for policy synthesis problems that actively deceive an adversary about a system's reward. ``Diversionary deception'' leads an adversary to draw any false conclusion about the system's reward function. ``Targeted deception'' leads an adversary to draw a specific false conclusion about the system's reward function. ``Equivocal deception'' leads an adversary to infer that the real reward and a false reward both explain the system's behavior. We show how each form of deception can be implemented in policy optimization problems and analytically bound the loss in total accumulated reward induced by deception. Next, we evaluate these developments in a multi-agent setting. We show that diversionary, targeted, and equivocal deception all steer the adversary to false beliefs while still attaining a total accumulated reward that is at least 97% of its optimal, non-deceptive value."}

The selection of predictors is crucial, strongly impacting both model accuracy and how well the predictions reflect ecological patterns. To ensure meaningful insights, input variables must be carefully chosen to match the study objectives and the ecological requirements of the target species. However, existing SDMs, including both traditional and deep learning-based approaches, often lack key capabilities for variable selection: (i) flexibility to choose relevant predictors at inference without retraining; (ii) robustness to handle missing predictor values without compromising accuracy; and (iii) explainability to interpret and accurately quantify each predictor's contribution. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MaskSDM, a novel deep learning-based SDM that enables flexible predictor selection by employing a masked training strategy. This approach allows the model to make predictions with arbitrary subsets of input variables while remaining robust to missing data. It also provides a clearer understanding of how adding or removing a given predictor affects model performance and predictions. Additionally, MaskSDM leverages Shapley values for precise predictor contribution assessments, improving upon traditional approximations. We evaluate MaskSDM on the global sPlotOpen dataset, modeling the distributions of 12,738 plant species. Our results show that MaskSDM outperforms imputation-based methods and approximates models trained on specific subsets of variables.

Alignment and evaluation are critical components in the development of reliable LLMs, and the choice of feedback protocol plays a central role in both but remains understudied. In this work, we show that the choice of feedback protocol for evaluation (absolute scores versus relative preferences) can significantly affect evaluation reliability and induce systematic biases. In the context of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, we show that pairwise protocols are more vulnerable to distracted evaluation. Generator models can exploit spurious attributes (or distractor features) favored by the LLM judge, resulting in inflated scores for lower-quality outputs. We find that absolute scoring is more robust to such manipulation, producing judgments that better reflect response quality and are less influenced by distractor features. Our results demonstrate that generator models can flip preferences by embedding distractor features, skewing LLM-as-a-judge comparisons and leading to inaccurate conclusions about model quality in benchmark evaluations. Pairwise preferences flip in about 35% of the cases, compared to only 9% for absolute scores.

State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based, but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning. Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum multiple individual rewards, \\eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches. Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to 300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark, outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin. Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is the best learning-based approach on nuPlan.

We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications, efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not present during the pretraining stage.We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help improve the experience of more than half a billion users across various applications."}

In this work, we propose a new geometric reinterpretation which complements the probabilistic view and enhances its intuitiveness. We demonstrate that the proper construction of semantic manifolds arises primarily from the constraining effect of the KL divergence on the encoder. We view the latent representations as a Gaussian ball rather than deterministic points. Under the constraint of KL divergence, Gaussian ball regularizes the latent space, promoting a more uniform distribution of encodings. Furthermore, we show that reparameterization establishes a critical contractual mechanism between the encoder and decoder, enabling the decoder to learn how to reconstruct from these stochastic regions. We further connect this viewpoint with VQ-VAE, offering a unified perspective: VQ-VAE can be seen as an autoencoder where encodings are constrained to a set of cluster centers, with its generative capability arising from the compactness rather than its stochasticity. This geometric framework provides a new lens for understanding how VAE shapes the latent geometry to enable effective generation."}

However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts -- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also facilitate more diverse model responses."}

Each financial institution trains a local sub-model. The model parameters are protected using differential privacy and noise injection before being uploaded. A central server then aggregates these parameters to generate a global model. This global model is used for systemic risk identification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, multiple experiments are conducted. These evaluate communication efficiency, model accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization. The results show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional centralized methods and existing federated learning variants across all evaluation metrics.

To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations."}

Spikes lower beta2 toward beta2_min; calm phases keep it near beta2_max. Options include leaky-AMSGrad (decay), trust-region clipping (max_ratio), adaptive tiny terms, and several bias-correction modes ``none'', ``beta2max'', ``exact').

We study Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield the smallest gains.

With solo allreduce, the faster processes contribute their gradients eagerly without waiting for the slower processes, whereas with majority allreduce, at least half of the participants must contribute gradients before continuing, all without using a central parameter server. We theoretically prove the convergence of the algorithms and describe the partial collectives in detail.

Instead, this work focuses on general non-linear settings where agents respond to the decision policy with only \"local information\" of the policy. Moreover, we simultaneously consider the objectives of maximizing decision-maker welfare (model prediction accuracy), social welfare (agent improvement caused by strategic behaviors), and agent welfare (the extent that ML underestimates the agents). We first generalize the agent best response model in previous works to the non-linear setting, then reveal the compatibility of welfare objectives. We show the three welfare can attain the optimum simultaneously only under restrictive conditions which are challenging to achieve in non-linear settings.

However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training.

To strike a balance between performance and cost, we propose a routing framework, called RouteT2I, which dynamically selects either the large cloud model or the light-weight edge model for each user prompt. Since generated image quality is challenging to measure and compare directly, RouteT2I establishes multi-dimensional quality metrics, particularly, by evaluating the similarity between the generated images and both positive and negative texts that describe each specific quality metric. RouteT2I then predicts the expected quality of the generated images by identifying key tokens in the prompt and comparing their impact on the quality. RouteT2I further introduces the Pareto relative superiority to compare the multi-metric quality of the generated images.

To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs.

However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We name our method LD-SMC. We define a generative model for the data using additional auxiliary observations and perform posterior inference with SMC sampling based on a reverse diffusion process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of LD-SMC over competing methods in various inverse problem tasks and especially in challenging inpainting tasks."}

The impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself.We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how to quantify the creation of overconfident or intuitive responses-the signature of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, the idealized unconstrained reasoning strictly preserves semantic content.By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in departures from truthfulness, semantic information conservation, revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality-we offer a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems.

As the Langevin dynamics is now self-regulated by its own density, it forms a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Nemytskii type, distinct from the standard McKean-Vlasov equations. Relying on Wasserstein subdifferential calculus, we first show that the corresponding (nonlinear) Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution. Next, a weak solution to the SDE is constructed from the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, by Trevisan's superposition principle.

This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial sectors."}

While RL drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025) shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning capabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows a 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on MATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements over the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code structure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of concept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack Overflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. Findings emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective adoption."}

Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains largely underexplored.In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions."}

Due to the near real-time response requirements of this task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed, supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However, these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model. First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in various code completion models."}

Although several methods have been proposed to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper, we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing, compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs.

We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each TD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used action research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates IT solutions for signal processing.

This work explores a range of existing and future quantum communication networks, specifically quantum key distribution network proposals, to model and demonstrate the evolution of quantum key distribution network architectures. Leveraging Orthogonal Variability Modelling and Systems Modelling Language as candidate modelling languages, the study creates traceable artefacts to promote modular architectures that are reusable for future studies. We propose a variability-driven framework for managing fast-evolving network architectures with respect to increasing stakeholder expectations. The result contributes to the systematic development of viable quantum key distribution networks and supports the investigation of similar integration challenges relevant to the broader context of quantum systems engineering."}

Current methods on PCR mainly focus on the reviewer's perspective, including finding a capable reviewer, predicting comment quality, and recommending/generating review comments. However, it is not well studied that how to satisfy the review necessity requests posted by developers which can increase their visibility, which in turn acts as a prerequisite for better review responses. To this end, we propose K nowledge-guided P rompt learning for P ublic Code Review (KP-PCR) to achieve developer-based code review request quality assurance (i.e., predicting request necessity and recommending tags subtask). Specifically, we reformulate the two subtasks via 1) text prompt tuning which converts both of them into a Masked Language Model (MLM) by constructing prompt templates using hard prompt; and 2) knowledge and code prefix tuning which introduces knowledge guidance from fine-tuned large language models by soft prompt, and uses program dependence graph to characterize code snippets. Finally, both of the request necessity prediction and tag recommendation subtasks output predicted results through an answer engineering module. In addition, we further analysis the time complexity of our KP-PCR that has lightweight prefix based the operation of introducing knowledge guidance. Experimental results on the PCR dataset for the period 2011-2023 demonstrate that our KP-PCR outperforms baselines by 2.3%-8.4% in the request necessity prediction and by 1.4%-6.9% in the tag recommendation.

However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B."}

Demonstrating compliance requires tracing requirements to legal provisions. Requirements traceability is a key task where engineers must analyze technical requirements against target artifacts, often within limited time. Manually analyzing complex systems with hundreds of requirements is infeasible. The legal dimension adds challenges that increase effort. In this paper, we investigate two automated solutions based on language models, including large ones (LLMs). The first solution, Kashif, is a classifier that leverages sentence transformers and semantic similarity. The second solution, RICE, prompts a recent generative LLM based on RICEORG, a prompt engineering framework. On a benchmark dataset, we empirically evaluate Kashif and compare it against five different baseline classifiers from the literature. Kashif can identify trace links with a recall of 67%, precision of 50%, and F2 score of 63%, outperforming the best baseline by a substantial margin of 41 percentage points (pp) in F2. However, on unseen, more complex requirements documents traced to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average recall of 15%, an average precision of 10%, and an average F2 score of 13.5%. On the same documents, however, our RICE solution yields an average recall of 84%, an average precision of 30%, and an average F2 score of 61%. RICE achieved a remarkable improvement of 47.5 pp over Kashif in terms of F2 score. Our results suggest that requirements traceability in the legal context cannot be simply addressed by building classifiers, as such solutions do not generalize and fail to perform well on complex regulations and requirements. Resorting to generative LLMs, with careful prompt engineering, is thus a more promising alternative."}

However, its broader adoption faces considerable challenges, particularly concerning alignment between test generation methodologies and software requirements. REquirements-Driven Automated Software Testing (REDAST) addresses this gap by systematically leveraging requirements as the foundation for automated test artifact generation. This systematic literature review (SLR) critically examines the REDAST landscape, analyzing the current state of requirements input formats, transformation techniques, generated test artifacts, evaluation methods, and prevailing limitations. We conducted a thorough analysis of 156 relevant studies selected through a rigorous multi-stage filtering process from an initial collection of 27,333 papers sourced from six major research databases. Our findings highlight the predominance of functional requirements, model-based specifications, and natural language formats. Rule-based techniques are extensively utilized, while machine learning-based approaches remain relatively underexplored. Furthermore, most existing frameworks are sequential and dependent on singular intermediate representations, and while test cases, structured textual formats, and requirements coverage are common, full automation remains rare. We identify significant gaps related to automation completeness and dependency on input quality. This comprehensive synthesis provides a detailed overview of REDAST research and limitations, offering clear, evidence-based recommendations to guide future advancements in automated software testing."}

Differentiating between a text written by a human and one generated by an LLM has become almost impossible. Information-hiding techniques such as digital watermarking or steganography can help by embedding information inside text in a form that is unlikely to be noticed. However, existing techniques, such as linguistic-based or format-based methods, change the semantics or cannot be applied to pure, unformatted text. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for information hiding called Innamark, which can conceal any byte-encoded sequence within a sufficiently long cover text. This method is implemented as a multi-platform library using the Kotlin programming language, which is accompanied by a command-line tool and a web interface. By substituting conventional whitespace characters with visually similar Unicode whitespace characters, our proposed scheme preserves the semantics of the cover text without changing the number of characters. Furthermore, we propose a specified structure for secret messages that enables configurable compression, encryption, hashing, and error correction. An experimental benchmark comparison on a dataset of 1 000 000 Wikipedia articles compares ten algorithms. The results demonstrate the robustness of our proposed Innamark method in various applications and the imperceptibility of its watermarks to humans. We discuss the limits to the embedding capacity and robustness of the algorithm and how these could be addressed in future work."}

While prior work has primarily focused on refining scoring functions and adjusting test-time thresholds, such algorithmic improvements offer only incremental gains. We argue that a rethinking of the entire development lifecycle is needed to mitigate these risks effectively. This work addresses two overlooked dimensions of OoD detection in object detection. First, we reveal fundamental flaws in widely used evaluation benchmarks: contrary to their design intent, up to 13% of objects in the OoD test sets actually belong to in-distribution classes, and vice versa. These quality issues severely distort the reported performance of existing methods and contribute to their high false positive rates. Second, we introduce a novel training-time mitigation paradigm that operates independently of external OoD detectors. Instead of relying solely on post-hoc scoring, we fine-tune the detector using a carefully synthesized OoD dataset that semantically resembles in-distribution objects. This process shapes a defensive decision boundary by suppressing objectness on OoD objects, leading to a 91% reduction in hallucination error of a YOLO model on BDD-100K. Our methodology generalizes across detection paradigms such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR, and supports few-shot adaptation. Together, these contributions offer a principled and effective way to reduce OoD-induced hallucination in object detectors. Code and data are available at:this https URL."}

We demonstrate that our model captures the behavior of React, by theoretically showing that it embodies essential properties of Hooks and empirically comparing our React-tRace-definitional interpreter against a test suite. Furthermore, we showcase a practical visualization tool based on the formalization to demonstrate how developers can better understand the semantics of Hooks."}
