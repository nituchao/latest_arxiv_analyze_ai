However, the data required for a life cycle assessment (LCA) that maps the materials and processes from product manufacturing to disposal into environmental impacts (EI) are often unavailable. Here we reimagine conventional LCA by introducing multimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and stakeholders like product managers and engineers to calculate the cradle-to-gate (production) carbon emissions of electronic devices. The AI agents iteratively generate a detailed life-cycle inventory leveraging a custom data abstraction and software tools that extract information from online text and images from repair communities and government certifications. This approach reduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data availability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of expert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to directly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with similar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop with a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven method to generate emission factors. We use the properties of an unknown material to represent it as a weighted sum of emission factors for similar materials. Compared to human experts picking the closest LCA database entry, this improves MAPE by 120.26%. We analyze the data and compute scaling of this approach and discuss its implications for future LCA workflows."}

Its objective is to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent is defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location. Explicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for bounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a user-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and a lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of paths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve collisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its optimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually bounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower bound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up EECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though EECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution, increasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS to switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a particular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue, we propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion to the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy constraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we propose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical framework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is complete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches outperform the original (greedy) flex distribution."}

To ensure LLMs do not assist with harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the \"Safety Tax\". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning abilities. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. We also explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or during weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks. We hope this result motivates designing approaches that yield more consistent improvements in the reasoning-safety trade-off."}

This paper presents ExplainVulD, a graph-based framework for vulnerability detection in C/C++ code. The method constructs Code Property Graphs and represents nodes using dual-channel embeddings that capture both semantic and structural information. These are processed by an edge-aware attention mechanism that incorporates edge-type embeddings to distinguish among program relations. To address class imbalance, the model is trained using class-weighted cross-entropy loss. ExplainVulD achieves a mean accuracy of 88.25 percent and an F1 score of 48.23 percent across 30 independent runs on the ReVeal dataset. These results represent relative improvements of 4.6 percent in accuracy and 16.9 percent in F1 score compared to the ReVeal model, a prior learning-based method. The framework also outperforms static analysis tools, with relative gains of 14.0 to 14.1 percent in accuracy and 132.2 to 201.2 percent in F1 score. Beyond improved detection performance, ExplainVulD produces explainable outputs by identifying the most influential code regions within each function, supporting transparency and trust in security triage."}

Our findings highlight (1) countries that were most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic were also among the most active, with each country having specific research interests, (2) countries and institutions within the same region or share a common language tend to collaborate, (3) top active authors tend to form close partnerships with one or two key partners, (4) authors typically specialized in one or two specific topics, while institutions had more diverse interests across several topics, and (5) the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced research priorities in disaster informatics, placing greater emphasis on public health. We further demonstrate that the field is converging on multidimensional resilience strategies and cross-sectoral data-sharing collaborations or projects, reflecting a heightened awareness of global vulnerability and interdependency. Collecting and quality assurance strategies, data analytic practices, LLM-based topic extraction and summarization approaches, and result visualization tools can be applied to comparable datasets or solve similar analytic problems.

However, existing RAG studies primarily focus on retrieving isolated segments using similarity-based matching methods, while overlooking the intrinsic connections between them. This limitation hampers performance in RAG tasks. To address this, we propose QMKGF, a Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation. First, we design prompt templates and employ general-purpose LLMs to extract entities and relations, thereby generating a knowledge graph (KG) efficiently. Based on the constructed KG, we introduce a multi-path subgraph construction strategy that incorporates one-hop relations, multi-hop relations, and importance-based relations, aiming to improve the semantic relevance between the retrieved documents and the user query. Subsequently, we designed a query-aware attention reward model that scores subgraph triples based on their semantic relevance to the query. Then, we select the highest score subgraph and enrich subgraph with additional triples from other subgraphs that are highly semantically relevant to the query. Finally, the entities, relations, and triples within the updated subgraph are utilised to expand the original query, thereby enhancing its semantic representation and improving the quality of LLMs' generation. We evaluate QMKGF on the SQuAD, IIRC, Culture, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue datasets. On the HotpotQA dataset, our method achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 64.98\\%, surpassing the BGE-Rerank approach by 9.72 percentage points (from 55.26\\% to 64.98\\%).

Although platforms offer mechanisms to mitigate exposure to undesired content, these mechanisms are often insufficiently effective and slow to adapt to users' feedback. This paper introduces an intuitive, model-agnostic, and distribution-free method that uses conformal risk control to provably bound unwanted content in personalized recommendations by leveraging simple binary feedback on items. We also address a limitation of traditional conformal risk control approaches, i.e., the fact that the recommender can provide a smaller set of recommended items, by leveraging implicit feedback on consumed items to expand the recommendation set while ensuring robust risk mitigation. Our experimental evaluation on data coming from a popular online video-sharing platform demonstrates that our approach ensures an effective and controllable reduction of unwanted recommendations with minimal effort.

Automated approaches face two major challenges: the scarcity of high-quality labeled CTI data and class imbalance, where many techniques have very few examples. While domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) such as SecureBERT have shown improved performance, most recent work focuses on model architecture rather than addressing the data limitations.

While global modality alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly, multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency. Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty, thereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public benchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority of existing state of the art methods."}

We propose SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning, (2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3) intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in aligning VLMs with human-centric values."}

However, current methods are often affected by misalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in projection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and rolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key insight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at object-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors. Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF) to process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly enhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively utilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features.

To address this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally, our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset, EntityText, generated using large language models.

Our research assesses the robustness of these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication triggers and updates the model to increase robustness.

To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or one-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps noise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by enforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous velocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a limiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first principles of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite integrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term Interval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential relationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals without resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we introduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic consistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the differential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit of our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This establishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning average velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is significantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations, resulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware compatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been successfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as Doubao), achieving speedups of 20x."}

This paper introduces RevisitVD, an extensive evaluation of 17 PLMs spanning smaller code-specific PLMs and large-scale PLMs using newly constructed datasets. Specifically, we compare the performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing settings, and analyze their robustness against code normalization, abstraction, and semantic-preserving transformations.Our findings reveal that, for VD tasks, PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora.

We evaluate eight classification models: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, HistGradientBoosting, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and TabNet, under three preprocessing settings: original feature space, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The models are assessed on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC to examine both predictive performance and robustness. Ensemble methods, especially LightGBM and XGBoost, show the best overall performance across all configurations, with minimal sensitivity to PCA and consistent generalization. LDA improves KNN performance but significantly reduces accuracy for boosting models. TabNet, while promising in theory, underperformed under feature reduction, likely due to architectural sensitivity to input structure.

However, for some domains high-quality pairwise comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and code tasks.

Understanding noise's impact is crucial for reproducibility and application reuse; moreover, the next-generation quantum-centric supercomputing essentially requires efficient and accurate noise characterization to support system management (e.g., job scheduling), where ensuring correct functional performance (i.e., fidelity) of jobs on available quantum devices can even be higher-priority than traditional objectives. However, noise fluctuates over time, even on the same quantum device, which makes predicting the computational bounds for on-the-fly noise is vital. Noisy quantum simulation can offer insights but faces efficiency and scalability issues. In this work, we propose a data-driven workflow, namely QuBound, to predict computational performance bounds. It decomposes historical performance traces to isolate noise sources and devises a novel encoder to embed circuit and noise information processed by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. For evaluation, we compare QuBound with a state-of-the-art learning-based predictor, which only generates a single performance value instead of a bound. Experimental results show that the result of the existing approach falls outside of performance bounds, while all predictions from our QuBound with the assistance of performance decomposition better fit the bounds. Moreover, QuBound can efficiently produce practical bounds for various circuits with over 106 speedup over simulation; in addition, the range from QuBound is over 10x narrower than the state-of-the-art analytical approach."}

To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video."}

Johansson", "title": "Pragmatic Policy Development via Interpretable Behavior Cloning", "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for deriving optimal policies from observational data, but challenges related to interpretability and evaluation limit its practical use in safety-critical domains. Interpretability is hindered by the black-box nature of unconstrained RL policies, while evaluation -- typically performed off-policy -- is sensitive to large deviations from the data-collecting behavior policy, especially when using methods based on importance sampling. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from the most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an interpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which is specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural grouping of states with respect to treatment. The tree structure ensures interpretability by design, while varying the number of actions considered controls the degree of overlap with the behavior policy, enabling reliable off-policy evaluation. This pragmatic approach to policy development standardizes frequent treatment patterns, capturing the collective clinical judgment embedded in the data. Using real-world examples in rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis care, we demonstrate that policies derived under this framework can outperform current practice, offering interpretable alternatives to those obtained via offline RL."}

This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel ensemble-based defense architecture to mitigate adversarial attacks in autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed architecture significantly enhances the robustness of DRL models.

Current lightweight methods primarily rely on the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of 3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified regions.

While it is often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI, Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small, consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis."}

Unlike prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or overlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where UAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve ground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex coupling between UAV motion and communication, we propose a hierarchical optimization framework. The inner layer uses a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex (d.c.) programming to solve the secrecy precoding problem with fixed UAV positions. The outer layer introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (LLM-HeMARL) for trajectory optimization. LLM-HeMARL efficiently incorporates expert heuristics policy generated by the LLM, enabling UAVs to learn energy-aware, security-driven trajectories without the inference overhead of real-time LLM calls. The simulation results show that our method outperforms existing baselines in secrecy rate and energy efficiency, with consistent robustness across varying UAV swarm sizes and random seeds."}

DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through a differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning on large grids.

Yet, little is known about how closely LLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral Dilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a distribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a free-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional alignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across dilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high consensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In parallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions extracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral values than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch in both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap, we introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs."}

Although recent studies have explored heterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying resource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and local model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address these limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split Learning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device systems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a personalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to achieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models tailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and privacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers clients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without sharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources, environmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach balances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high model accuracy.

This pressing issue highlights the need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality), computational node capabilities, and environmental impact.This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data. Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics, and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction, minimizing environmental impact during training.

The exsiting approaches on optimizing self-attention either discard full-contextual information or lack of flexibility. In this work, we design DistrAttention, an effcient and flexible self-attention mechanism with the full context.

By optimizing the selection of block sizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining high-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive experiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than FlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention.

Traditional methods often struggle with substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets, thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP) mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning. Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the way for more practical and scalable solutions."}

However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication."}

We conduct a series of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings, exploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context examples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To further probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based evaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the zero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than they provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a critical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual information, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine content, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic priors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on the e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model. Additionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model provides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with a BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%.

In particular, we propose two predictive surrogates that can substantially reduce the need for quantum processor access in diverse practical scenarios. To demonstrate their potential in advancing digital quantum simulation, we use these surrogates to emulate a quantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabling efficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for families of transverse-field Ising models and identification of non-equilibrium Floquet symmetry-protected topological phases. Experimental results reveal that the predictive surrogates not only reduce measurement overhead by orders of magnitude, but can also surpass the performance of conventional, quantum-resource-intensive approaches. Collectively, these findings establish predictive surrogates as a practical pathway to broadening the impact of advanced quantum processors."}

This paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast, when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system. Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver mobility."}

While compressibility and robustness have each been studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound, revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$ robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved - whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics. Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure."}

We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that transforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where one model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and defends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the correct solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach substantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet reuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions: (1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based assessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's effectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized protocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of the method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model fine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%) but performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can reliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based evaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a fraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks.

To address this problem, we start from the common pattern of temporal facts and propose a pattern-based temporal constraint mining method, PaTeCon. Unlike previous studies, PaTeCon uses graph patterns and statistical information relevant to the given KG to automatically generate temporal constraints, without the need for human experts.

The ambiguity inherent in natural language descriptions of software poses substantial obstacles to generating deployable, structured artifacts. This research champions Model Driven Development (MDD) as a viable strategy to overcome these challenges, proposing an Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD) approach that employs GPT4 as a code generator. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the code auto generation process and offers agility that allows seamless adaptation to changes in models or deployment environments. We illustrate this by modeling a multi agent Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), significantly reducing model ambiguity by integrating the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for code structure meta modeling, and the FIPA ontology language for communication semantics meta modeling. Applying GPT4 auto generation capabilities yields Java and Python code that is compatible with the JADE and PADE frameworks, respectively. Our thorough evaluation of the auto generated code verifies its alignment with expected behaviors and identifies enhancements in agent interactions. Structurally, we assessed the complexity of code derived from a model constrained solely by OCL meta models, against that influenced by both OCL and FIPA ontology meta models. The results indicate that the ontology constrained meta model produces inherently more complex code, yet its cyclomatic complexity remains within manageable levels, suggesting that additional meta model constraints can be incorporated without exceeding the high risk threshold for complexity."}

To address this, prior work has proposed a framework that learns a matching mechanism from examples, using a parameterized family that satisfies properties such as stability. However, despite its usefulness, this framework does not guarantee strategy-proofness (SP), and cannot handle varying numbers of agents or incorporate publicly available contextual information about agents, both of which are crucial in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a new parametrized family of matching mechanisms that always satisfy strategy-proofness, are applicable for an arbitrary number of agents, and deal with public contextual information of agents, based on the serial dictatorship (SD). This family is represented by NeuralSD, a novel neural network architecture based on SD, where agent rankings in SD are treated as learnable parameters computed from agents' contexts using an attention-based sub-network. To enable learning, we introduce tensor serial dictatorship (TSD), a differentiable relaxation of SD using tensor operations. This allows NeuralSD to be trained end-to-end from example matchings while satisfying SP. We conducted experiments to learn a matching mechanism from matching examples while satisfying SP. We demonstrated that our method outperformed baselines in predicting matchings and on several metrics for goodness of matching outcomes."}

In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs.

It is observed that existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform hierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification. Thus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it best hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates DenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for hierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal plants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed and precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model captures both local and global contextual information from the images, improving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new ones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple scales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical classification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and unknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and without background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word application. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species the model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for predicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high quality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated preference data. Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon associated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances performance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by providing diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during training. This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models encounter jailbreaking prompts. The issue is particularly pronounced when employing stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to generate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected responses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. Furthermore, with respect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model generation) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms configurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used directly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool. We demonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability between chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit superficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints.

Existing automated prompt optimization methods falter in these scenarios, as they typically require well-defined task-specific numerical fitness functions or rely on generic templates that cannot capture the nuanced requirements of complex use cases. We introduce DEEVO (DEbate-driven EVOlutionary prompt optimization), a novel framework that guides prompt evolution through a debate-driven evaluation with an Elo-based selection. Contrary to prior work, DEEVOs approach enables exploration of the discrete prompt space while preserving semantic coherence through intelligent crossover and strategic mutation operations that incorporate debate-based feedback, combining elements from both successful and unsuccessful prompts based on identified strengths rather than arbitrary splicing. Using Elo ratings as a fitness proxy, DEEVO simultaneously drives improvement and preserves valuable diversity in the prompt population. Experimental results demonstrate that DEEVO significantly outperforms both manual prompt engineering and alternative state-of-the-art optimization approaches on open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks despite using no ground truth feedback.

We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising. Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of occupational AI impact."}

However, existing recommender systems primarily focus on users' interaction behaviors with videos, neglecting comment content and interaction in user preference modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation approach called LSVCR that utilizes user interaction histories with both videos and comments to jointly perform personalized video and comment recommendation. Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: sequential recommendation (SR) model and supplemental large language model (LLM) recommender. The SR model functions as the primary recommendation backbone (retained in deployment) of our method for efficient user preference modeling. Concurrently, we employ a LLM as the supplemental recommender (discarded in deployment) to better capture underlying user preferences derived from heterogeneous interaction behaviors. In order to integrate the strengths of the SR model and the supplemental LLM recommender, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. The first stage, personalized preference alignment, aims to align the preference representations from both components, thereby enhancing the semantics of the SR model. The second stage, recommendation-oriented fine-tuning, involves fine-tuning the alignment-enhanced SR model according to specific objectives. Extensive experiments in both video and comment recommendation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of LSVCR.

Zero-shot fine-grained TSR in the wild is challenging due to the cross-domain problem between clean template traffic signs and real-world counterparts, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR scenarios, where traffic signs typically differ between countries. The proposed CdMT framework tackles these challenges by leveraging the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for LMMs. Context descriptions, which are enhanced by center coordinate prompt optimization, enable the precise localization of target traffic signs in complex road images and filter irrelevant responses via novel prior traffic sign hypotheses. Characteristic descriptions, which are derived from in-context learning with template traffic signs, bridge cross-domain gaps and enhance fine-grained TSR. Differential descriptions refine the multimodal reasoning ability of LMMs by distinguishing subtle differences among similar signs. CdMT is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions, enabling it to achieve cross-country TSR. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries. The proposed CdMT framework achieved superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods on all five datasets, with recognition accuracies of 0.93, 0.89, 0.97, 0.89, and 0.85 on the GTSRB, BTSD, TT-100K, Sapporo, and Yokohama datasets, respectively."}

To date, only a few studies have examined the vulnerability of skeleton-based neural networks to evasion and backdoor attacks. In this paper, we propose BadHMP, a novel backdoor attack that targets specifically human motion prediction tasks. Our approach involves generating poisoned training samples by embedding a localized backdoor trigger in one limb of the skeleton, causing selected joints to follow predefined motion in historical time steps. Subsequently, the future sequences are globally modified that all the joints move following the target trajectories. Our carefully designed backdoor triggers and targets guarantee the smoothness and naturalness of the poisoned samples, making them stealthy enough to evade detection by the model trainer while keeping the poisoned model unobtrusive in terms of prediction fidelity to untainted sequences. The target sequences can be successfully activated by the designed input sequences even with a low poisoned sample injection ratio. Experimental results on two datasets (Human3.6M and CMU-Mocap) and two network architectures (LTD and HRI) demonstrate the high-fidelity, effectiveness, and stealthiness of BadHMP.

However, distinguishing arterioles from venules in fUS is challenging due to opposing blood flow directions within the same pixel. Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) can enhance resolution by tracking microbubble contrast agents but is invasive, and lacks dynamic CBV quantification. In this paper, we introduce the first deep learning-based segmentation tool for fUS images, capable of differentiating signals from different vascular compartments, based on ULM automatic annotation and enabling dynamic CBV quantification. We evaluate various UNet architectures on fUS images of rat brains, achieving competitive segmentation performance, with 90% accuracy, a 71% F1 score, and an IoU of 0.59, using only 100 temporal frames from a fUS stack. These results are comparable to those from tubular structure segmentation in other imaging modalities. Additionally, models trained on resting-state data generalize well to images captured during visual stimulation, highlighting robustness.

To tackle this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Learning for Autonomous Driving (RALAD), a novel framework designed to bridge the real-to-sim gap at a low cost. RALAD features three primary designs, including (1) domain adaptation via an enhanced Optimal Transport (OT) method that accounts for both individual and grouped image distances, (2) a simple and unified framework that can be applied to various models, and (3) efficient fine-tuning techniques that freeze the computationally expensive layers while maintaining robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that RALAD compensates for the performance degradation in simulated environments while maintaining accuracy in real-world scenarios across three different models. Taking Cross View as an example, the mIOU and mAP metrics in real-world scenarios remain stable before and after RALAD fine-tuning, while in simulated environments,the mIOU and mAP metrics are improved by 10.30% and 12.29%, respectively.

We focus on three techniques: scaling test-time computation for verification, aligning model preferences with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and integrating these techniques for complementary effects. Our results demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to significantly improve image generation performance. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the Potential Assessment Reward Model (PARM) and PARM++, specialized for autoregressive image generation. PARM adaptively assesses each generation step through a potential assessment approach, merging the strengths of existing reward models, and PARM++ further introduces a reflection mechanism to self-correct the generated unsatisfactory image, which is the first to incorporate reflection in autoregressive image generation. Using our investigated reasoning strategies, we enhance a baseline model, Show-o, to achieve superior results, with a significant +24% improvement on the GenEval benchmark, surpassing Stable Diffusion 3 by +15%. We hope our study provides unique insights and paves a new path for integrating CoT reasoning with autoregressive image generation. Code and models are released atthis https URL"}

Larsson", "title": "Optimizing Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Decentralized Learning with Generalized Correlated Noise", "abstract": "Decentralized learning enables distributed agents to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model without a central server, through local computation and peer-to-peer communication. Although each agent retains its dataset locally, sharing local models can still expose private information about the local training datasets to adversaries. To mitigate privacy attacks, a common strategy is to inject random artificial noise at each agent before exchanging local models between neighbors. However, this often leads to utility degradation due to the negative effects of cumulated artificial noise on the learning algorithm. In this work, we introduce CorN-DSGD, a novel covariance-based framework for generating correlated privacy noise across agents, which unifies several state-of-the-art methods as special cases. By leveraging network topology and mixing weights, CorN-DSGD optimizes the noise covariance to achieve network-wide noise cancellation. Experimental results show that CorN-DSGD cancels more noise than existing pairwise correlation schemes, improving model performance under formal privacy guarantees."}

On the most challenging time split of PoseBusters aiming to assess generalization ability (structures submitted after September 30, 2021), RAPID-Net-guided AutoDock Vina achieves 53.1% of Top-1 poses with RMSD < 2 A and PB-valid, versus 59.5% for AlphaFold 3.

The lightweight inference, scalability, and competitive accuracy of RAPID-Net position it as a viable option for large-scale virtual screening campaigns. Across diverse benchmark datasets, RAPID-Net outperforms other pocket prediction tools, including PUResNet and Kalasanty, in both docking accuracy and pocket-ligand intersection rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of RAPID-Net to accelerate the development of novel therapeutics by highlighting its performance on pharmacologically relevant targets. RAPID-Net accurately identifies distal functional sites, offering new opportunities for allosteric inhibitor design.

However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization."}

To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset.

To bridge this gap, we propose EXGnet, a novel and reliable ECG arrhythmia classification network tailored for single-lead signals, specifically designed to balance high accuracy, explainability, and edge compatibility. EXGnet integrates XAI supervision during training via a normalized cross-correlation based loss, directing the model's attention to clinically relevant ECG regions, similar to a cardiologist's focus. This supervision is driven by automatically generated ground truth, derived through an innovative heart rate variability-based approach, without the need for manual annotation. To enhance classification accuracy without compromising deployment simplicity, we incorporate quantitative ECG features during training. These enrich the model with multi-domain knowledge but are excluded during inference, keeping the model lightweight for edge deployment. Additionally, we introduce an innovative multiresolution block to efficiently capture both short and long-term signal features while maintaining computational efficiency. Rigorous evaluation on the Chapman and Ningbo benchmark datasets validates the supremacy of EXGnet, which achieves average five-fold accuracies of 98.762% and 96.932%, and F1-scores of 97.910% and 95.527%, respectively.

However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

Using this framework, we create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations from 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable insights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong performance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of science from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors affect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final engagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive significantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different scientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently.

Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection.

We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework.We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task.

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end, we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident, one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further improve over vanilla self consistency.

To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies, reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment.

However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings. The code is available atthis https URL."}

This study presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework for computing green hydrogen yield and site suitability index using mean absolute SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values.

To address this, we introduce EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification (HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement, or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations. Quantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations demonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in both magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness across challenging surgical conditions.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information, they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial feature extraction.

Each scene provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1) Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely large-scale generation.

AI Consult integrates into clinician workflows, activating only when needed and preserving clinician autonomy.

In this paper, we explore how using binary representations (barcodes) instead of real-valued features can be used for NLP embeddings derived from machine learning models such as BERT. Thresholding is a common method for converting continuous embeddings into binary representations, often using a fixed threshold across all features. We propose a Coordinate Search-based optimization framework that instead identifies the optimal threshold for each feature, demonstrating that feature-specific thresholds lead to improved performance in binary encoding. This ensures that the binary representations are both accurate and efficient, enhancing performance across various features. Our optimal barcode representations have shown promising results in various NLP applications, demonstrating their potential to transform text representation. We conducted extensive experiments and statistical tests on different NLP tasks and datasets to evaluate our approach and compare it to other thresholding methods. Binary embeddings generated using using optimal thresholds found by our method outperform traditional binarization methods in accuracy. This technique for generating binary representations is versatile and can be applied to any features, not just limited to NLP embeddings, making it useful for a wide range of domains in machine learning applications."}

Yet, little is known about how closely LLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral Dilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a distribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a free-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional alignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across dilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high consensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In parallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions extracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral values than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch in both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap, we introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs."}

As such, our contribution is twofold: at the level of contributed resources, as there are no datasets annotated with all studied dimensions, this work compares and evaluates automated annotation methods for each subjective feature. At the level of novel insights, our regression analysis uncovers different patterns of impact of subjective features on the two facets of argument strength encoded in the datasets.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication."}

In this work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French, Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories: language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs. English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14 leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent set.

Prior research has shown that intermediate layers contain sufficient information to generate accurate answers, leading to the development of early-exit algorithms that reduce inference costs by terminating computation at earlier layers. However, these methods often suffer from poor performance due to misalignment between intermediate and output layer representations that lead to decoding inaccuracy. To address these challenges, we propose SPADE (SPace Alignment DEcoding), a novel decoding method that aligns intermediate layer representations with the output layer by propagating a minimally reduced sequence consisting of only the start token and the answer token. We further optimize the early-exit decision-making process by training a linear approximation of SPADE that computes entropy-based confidence metrics. Putting them together, we create a hybrid early-exit algorithm that monitors confidence levels and stops inference at intermediate layers while using SPADE to generate high-quality outputs. This approach significantly reduces inference costs without compromising accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for deploying large language models in real-world applications."}

Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18 million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017 and 2022.

However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge: predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources, thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws.

Our findings highlight (1) countries that were most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic were also among the most active, with each country having specific research interests, (2) countries and institutions within the same region or share a common language tend to collaborate, (3) top active authors tend to form close partnerships with one or two key partners, (4) authors typically specialized in one or two specific topics, while institutions had more diverse interests across several topics, and (5) the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced research priorities in disaster informatics, placing greater emphasis on public health. We further demonstrate that the field is converging on multidimensional resilience strategies and cross-sectoral data-sharing collaborations or projects, reflecting a heightened awareness of global vulnerability and interdependency.

However, existing RAG studies primarily focus on retrieving isolated segments using similarity-based matching methods, while overlooking the intrinsic connections between them. This limitation hampers performance in RAG tasks. To address this, we propose QMKGF, a Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation. First, we design prompt templates and employ general-purpose LLMs to extract entities and relations, thereby generating a knowledge graph (KG) efficiently. Based on the constructed KG, we introduce a multi-path subgraph construction strategy that incorporates one-hop relations, multi-hop relations, and importance-based relations, aiming to improve the semantic relevance between the retrieved documents and the user query. Subsequently, we designed a query-aware attention reward model that scores subgraph triples based on their semantic relevance to the query. Then, we select the highest score subgraph and enrich subgraph with additional triples from other subgraphs that are highly semantically relevant to the query. Finally, the entities, relations, and triples within the updated subgraph are utilised to expand the original query, thereby enhancing its semantic representation and improving the quality of LLMs' generation. We evaluate QMKGF on the SQuAD, IIRC, Culture, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue datasets. On the HotpotQA dataset, our method achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 64.98\\%, surpassing the BGE-Rerank approach by 9.72 percentage points (from 55.26\\% to 64.98\\%). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QMKGF approach."}

This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use modern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first propose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR models for MDD. Next, we define a more general alignment-free method that takes all possible alignments of the target phoneme into account (GOP-AF). We give a theoretical account of our definition of GOP-AF, an implementation that solves potential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which makes the method applicable with acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We provide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and Speechocean762 datasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the dependency of GOP-AF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount of context around the target phoneme.

Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning, we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap between current MLLMs and human perception.

In this paper, we apply state probing, a method for evaluating a language model's understanding of the world, to the domain of cooking. We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well LLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures.

While existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used. Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables. Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs.

To mitigate the scarcity of double-line license plate datasets, we constructed a single/double-line license plate dataset by synthesizing images, applying texture mapping onto real scenes, and blending them with authentic license plate images.

We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following (\"player\") and reward modeling (\"referee\") within a single model and a single training phase. Our method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks. Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24 to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore, URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training, achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward model it replaces (83.55).

While some prior works have explored this issue in the context of LLMs, it presents a unique challenge for MLLMs due to the entangled nature of knowledge across modalities, making comprehensive unlearning more difficult. To address this challenge, we propose Modality Aware Neuron Unlearning (MANU), a novel unlearning framework for MLLMs designed to selectively clip neurons based on their relative importance to the targeted forget data, curated for different modalities. Specifically, MANU consists of two stages: important neuron selection and selective pruning. The first stage identifies and collects the most influential neurons across modalities relative to the targeted forget knowledge, while the second stage is dedicated to pruning those selected neurons. MANU effectively isolates and removes the neurons that contribute most to the forget data within each modality, while preserving the integrity of retained knowledge. Our experiments conducted across various MLLM architectures illustrate that MANU can achieve a more balanced and comprehensive unlearning in each modality without largely affecting the overall model utility."}

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a framework called EpicPRM, which annotates each intermediate reasoning step based on its quantified contribution and uses an adaptive binary search algorithm to enhance both annotation precision and efficiency. Using this approach, we efficiently construct a high-quality process supervision training dataset named Epic50k, consisting of 50k annotated intermediate steps.

However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative to develop specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN.

Using this framework, we create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations from 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable insights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong performance.

(2) Perception as a predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final engagement pattern.

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end, we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident, one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further improve over vanilla self consistency.

To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies, reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment.

We develop a general mathematical model of discursive networks that shows that a network governed only by drift and self-repair stabilizes at a modest error rate. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer review with the open-source Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm: a configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a harmonizer merges their verdicts.

To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm.

However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image. This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network.

While global modality alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly, multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.

In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses.

We propose SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning, (2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3) intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in aligning VLMs with human-centric values."}

However, current methods are often affected by misalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in projection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and rolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key insight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at object-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors. Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF) to process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly enhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries.

Both in-context learning and training on language backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods to enhance visual generalization in future work."}

Among these applications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built environment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed imagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from satellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of high-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture the built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable advancements in object detection and representation using visual data, primitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in computer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on labor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep learning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address these challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach enhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building boundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and embedding Attraction Field Maps into the network.

Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks.

Existing methods generally rely on single-level visual features, limiting their ability to capture complex distortions in AIGC images. To address this limitation, a multi-level visual representation paradigm is proposed with three stages, namely multi-level feature extraction, hierarchical fusion, and joint aggregation. Based on this paradigm, two networks are developed. Specifically, the Multi-Level Global-Local Fusion Network (MGLF-Net) is designed for the perceptual quality assessment, extracting complementary local and global features via dual CNN and Transformer visual backbones. The Multi-Level Prompt-Embedded Fusion Network (MPEF-Net) targets Text-to-Image correspondence by embedding prompt semantics into the visual feature fusion process at each feature level. The fused multi-level features are then aggregated for final evaluation. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate outstanding performance on both tasks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed multi-level visual assessment paradigm."}

State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via vision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised pre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to boost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models exclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to learn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we investigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training, aiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data for foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a synergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training framework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge in combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model lies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.

In this way, the more semantic specific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for semantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation loss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature space back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space.

First, the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second, providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large) to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts.

Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix, PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available."}

This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects. To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism.

Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling attributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning. However, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual dependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally pair with specific objects (e.g., \"striped\" applies to \"zebra\" or \"shirts\" but not \"sky\" or \"water\"), while the same attribute can manifest differently depending on context (e.g., \"young\" in \"young tree\" vs. \"young dog\"). Thus, capturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet long-ignored challenge in CZSL. In this paper, we adopt a Conditional Probability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies. We decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the likelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To enhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to highlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features then guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring better contextual alignment.

We conduct a series of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings, exploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context examples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To further probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based evaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the zero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than they provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a critical factor that influences the predictions.

Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on the e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.

To shed light on the research landscape and facilitate further research, a systematic, detailed, and thorough comparative evaluation of recent Deep Learning (DL)-based methods for X-ray object detection is conducted. For this, a comprehensive evaluation framework is developed, composed of: a) Six recent, large-scale, and widely used public datasets for X-ray illicit item detection (OPIXray, CLCXray, SIXray, EDS, HiXray, and PIDray), b) Ten different state-of-the-art object detection schemes covering all main categories in the literature, including generic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), custom CNN, generic transformer, and hybrid CNN-transformer architectures, and c) Various detection (mAP50 and mAP50:95) and time/computational-complexity (inference time (ms), parameter size (M), and computational load (GFLOPS)) metrics. A thorough analysis of the results leads to critical observations and insights, emphasizing key aspects such as: a) Overall behavior of the object detection schemes, b) Object-level detection performance, c) Dataset-specific observations, and d) Time efficiency and computational complexity analysis.

However, parallel inference introduces significant communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices, limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations, saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information. To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On 4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.

Our method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.

This limitation prevents the models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant tasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in complex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a Multi-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud understanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i) Token-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing the model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level reconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions directly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed point cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning (MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus assembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image modalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates without requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large datasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various downstream tasks.

In this paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD (h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can efficiently degrade the image generation process.

To address these issues, we propose D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust vision-guided translation.

However, the lack of reconstruction details and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our residual-based framework.

We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30 participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing human visual attention.

We compared human and ViT attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate that while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior, particularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items.

In this work, we introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD robustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative nuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual nuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion models. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that outperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with generative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study to evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance shifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model rankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be captured when applying common binary shifts.

Their remarkable performance in understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks (NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations. This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult to spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements in their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such as BetterCheck that we propose in our work."}

Many existing AI approaches fall short by focusing on single view inputs or single-task outputs, limiting their clinical utility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-view, multitask hybrid deep learning framework that processes all four standard mammography views and jointly predicts diagnostic labels and BI-RADS scores for each breast. Our architecture integrates a hybrid CNN VSSM backbone, combining convolutional encoders for rich local feature extraction with Visual State Space Models (VSSMs) to capture global contextual dependencies. To improve robustness and interpretability, we incorporate a gated attention-based fusion module that dynamically weights information across views, effectively handling cases with missing data. We conduct extensive experiments across diagnostic tasks of varying complexity, benchmarking our proposed hybrid models against baseline CNN architectures and VSSM models in both single task and multi task learning settings. Across all tasks, the hybrid models consistently outperform the baselines. In the binary BI-RADS 1 vs. 5 classification task, the shared hybrid model achieves an AUC of 0.9967 and an F1 score of 0.9830. For the more challenging ternary classification, it attains an F1 score of 0.7790, while in the five-class BI-RADS task, the best F1 score reaches 0.4904.

To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions.

In this work, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset distillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes decoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of quantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss as the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable fair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise storage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs.

Through algorithm-centric and human-centered evaluations, we systematically compare four conditions: AI-only, human-only, human-AI, and human-XAI. Our findings reveal that while explainability features modestly improve user trust and willingness to override AI errors, they do not exceed the standalone AI in aggregate performance. Nevertheless, future work extending both the algorithmic design and the human-XAI collaboration elements holds promise for more robust quality assurance of 2D/3D registration."}

Accurate and efficient interpretation of multi-view mammograms is essential for early detection, driving a surge of interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered CAD models. While state-of-the-art multi-view mammogram classification models are largely based on Transformer architectures, their computational complexity scales quadratically with the number of image patches, highlighting the need for more efficient alternatives. To address this challenge, we propose Mammo-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Selective State-Space Models (SSMs), transformer-based attention, and expert-driven feature refinement into a unified architecture. Mammo-Mamba extends the MambaVision backbone by introducing the Sequential Mixture of Experts (SeqMoE) mechanism through its customized SecMamba block. The SecMamba is a modified MambaVision block that enhances representation learning in high-resolution mammographic images by enabling content-adaptive feature refinement. These blocks are integrated into the deeper stages of MambaVision, allowing the model to progressively adjust feature emphasis through dynamic expert gating, effectively mitigating the limitations of traditional Transformer models. Evaluated on the CBIS-DDSM benchmark dataset, Mammo-Mamba achieves superior classification performance across all key metrics while maintaining computational efficiency."}

In this work, we propose a novel Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) that explicitly incorporates target image sequence from the cardiac cycle to achieve smooth and temporally consistent motion tracking. By developing a bi-directional Mamba block equipped with a bi-directional scanning mechanism, our method facilitates the estimation of plausible deformation fields. With our proposed motion decoder that integrates motion information from frames adjacent to the target frame, our method further enhances temporal coherence. Moreover, by taking advantage of Mamba's structured state-space formulation, the proposed method learns the continuous dynamics of the myocardium from sequential images without increasing computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed method on two public datasets.

To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric losses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict constraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly optimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting ability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding advanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging theoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust loss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses. However, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced optimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and applicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric losses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario and propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We rigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE satisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric passive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss framework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL).

While compressibility and robustness have each been studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound, revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$ robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved - whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics. Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure."}

While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they require large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world field deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant human resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this challenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during model training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to diversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we hypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to suboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with frequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we propose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut) which masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed around crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level contextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our extensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that masking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and significantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual navigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward crop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and generalizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction in prediction error. In addition, we conduct ablation studies to determine the number of masks, the size of each mask, and the spatial distribution of masks to maximize overall performance."}

The proposed CdMT framework tackles these challenges by leveraging the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for LMMs. Context descriptions, which are enhanced by center coordinate prompt optimization, enable the precise localization of target traffic signs in complex road images and filter irrelevant responses via novel prior traffic sign hypotheses. Characteristic descriptions, which are derived from in-context learning with template traffic signs, bridge cross-domain gaps and enhance fine-grained TSR. Differential descriptions refine the multimodal reasoning ability of LMMs by distinguishing subtle differences among similar signs. CdMT is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions, enabling it to achieve cross-country TSR.

Our approach involves generating poisoned training samples by embedding a localized backdoor trigger in one limb of the skeleton, causing selected joints to follow predefined motion in historical time steps. Subsequently, the future sequences are globally modified that all the joints move following the target trajectories. Our carefully designed backdoor triggers and targets guarantee the smoothness and naturalness of the poisoned samples, making them stealthy enough to evade detection by the model trainer while keeping the poisoned model unobtrusive in terms of prediction fidelity to untainted sequences. The target sequences can be successfully activated by the designed input sequences even with a low poisoned sample injection ratio.

This paper presents a technique for loss evaluation that uses a transformer network as an additive loss in the face recognition domain. The standard metric loss function typically takes the final embedding of the main CNN backbone as its input. Here, we employ a transformer-metric loss, a combined approach that integrates both transformer-loss and metric-loss. This research intends to analyze the transformer behavior on the convolution output when the CNN outcome is arranged in a sequential vector. These sequential vectors have the potential to overcome the texture or regional structure referred to as wrinkles or sagging skin affected by aging. The transformer encoder takes input from the contextual vectors obtained from the final convolution layer of the network. The learned features can be more age-invariant, complementing the discriminative power of the standard metric loss embedding. With this technique, we use transformer loss with various base metric-loss functions to evaluate the effect of the combined loss functions.

To tackle this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Learning for Autonomous Driving (RALAD), a novel framework designed to bridge the real-to-sim gap at a low cost. RALAD features three primary designs, including (1) domain adaptation via an enhanced Optimal Transport (OT) method that accounts for both individual and grouped image distances, (2) a simple and unified framework that can be applied to various models, and (3) efficient fine-tuning techniques that freeze the computationally expensive layers while maintaining robustness.

However, it still remains an open question whether such strategies can be applied to verifying and reinforcing image generation scenarios. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. We focus on three techniques: scaling test-time computation for verification, aligning model preferences with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and integrating these techniques for complementary effects. Our results demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to significantly improve image generation performance. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the Potential Assessment Reward Model (PARM) and PARM++, specialized for autoregressive image generation. PARM adaptively assesses each generation step through a potential assessment approach, merging the strengths of existing reward models, and PARM++ further introduces a reflection mechanism to self-correct the generated unsatisfactory image, which is the first to incorporate reflection in autoregressive image generation. Using our investigated reasoning strategies, we enhance a baseline model, Show-o, to achieve superior results, with a significant +24% improvement on the GenEval benchmark, surpassing Stable Diffusion 3 by +15%.

However, according to current research, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to control the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such as a specific visual patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well equipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger inversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input spaces and low-dimensional triggers. For example, visual triggers are easily observed by defenders, text-based or attention-based triggers are more susceptible to neural network detection. To explore more possibilities of backdoor attack in DMs, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables attackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through style triggers within input images. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the first time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image-to-image tasks by introducing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term Timesteps-Retention (STTR). Our technique generates trigger-embedded images that are perceptually indistinguishable from clean images, thus bypassing both manual inspection and automated detection neural networks.

In response, we present an innovative, training-free method that directly addresses these challenges by incorporating tailored objectives to account for textual constraints. Unlike layout-based approaches that enforce rigid structures and limit diversity, our proposed approach offers a more flexible arrangement of the scene by imposing just the extracted constraints from the text, without any unnecessary additions. These constraints are formulated as losses-entity missing, entity mixing, attribute binding, and spatial relationships-integrated into a unified loss that is applied in the first generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce a feedback-driven system for fine-grained initial noise refinement. This system integrates a verifier that evaluates the generated image, identifies inconsistencies, and provides corrective feedback. Leveraging this feedback, our refinement method first targets the unmet constraints by refining the faulty attention maps caused by initial noise, through the optimization of selective losses associated with these constraints. Subsequently, our unified loss function is reapplied to proceed the second generation phase. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, relying solely on our proposed objective functions, significantly enhances compositionality, achieving a 24% improvement in human evaluation and a 25% gain in spatial relationships.

We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance, attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models. Our codes are publicly available at \\href{this https URL}"}

In this work, we identify and analyze the unique challenges that affect the generalization of range-view LiDAR segmentation in severe weather. To address these challenges, we propose a modular and lightweight framework that enhances robustness without altering the core architecture of existing models. Our method reformulates the initial stem block of standard range-view networks into two branches to process geometric attributes and reflectance intensity separately. Specifically, a Geometric Abnormality Suppression (GAS) module reduces the influence of weather-induced spatial noise, and a Reflectance Distortion Calibration (RDC) module corrects reflectance distortions through memory-guided adaptive instance normalization. The processed features are then fused and passed to the original segmentation pipeline.

Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity.

This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment. We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image alignment bias.

We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale).

Each scene provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1) Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications, from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

Conventional PACT images are degraded by wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue. Accounting for these effects can improve image quality and provide medically useful information, but measuring the SOS directly is burdensome and the existing joint reconstruction method is computationally expensive. Traditional supervised learning techniques are currently inaccessible in this data-starved domain. In this work, we introduce an efficient, self-supervised joint reconstruction method that recovers SOS and high-quality images for ring array PACT systems. To solve this semi-blind inverse problem, we parametrize the SOS using either a pixel grid or a neural field (NF) and update it directly by backpropagating the gradients through a differentiable imaging forward model. Our method removes SOS aberrations more accurately and 35x faster than the current SOTA. We demonstrate the success of our method quantitatively in simulation and qualitatively on experimentally-collected and in vivo data.

While MRI, CT, and PET modalities have significantly benefited from deep learning segmentation techniques, more recent modalities, like functional ultrasound (fUS), have seen limited progress. fUS is a non invasive imaging method that measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) with high spatio-temporal resolution. However, distinguishing arterioles from venules in fUS is challenging due to opposing blood flow directions within the same pixel. Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) can enhance resolution by tracking microbubble contrast agents but is invasive, and lacks dynamic CBV quantification. In this paper, we introduce the first deep learning-based segmentation tool for fUS images, capable of differentiating signals from different vascular compartments, based on ULM automatic annotation and enabling dynamic CBV quantification. We evaluate various UNet architectures on fUS images of rat brains, achieving competitive segmentation performance, with 90% accuracy, a 71% F1 score, and an IoU of 0.59, using only 100 temporal frames from a fUS stack. These results are comparable to those from tubular structure segmentation in other imaging modalities. Additionally, models trained on resting-state data generalize well to images captured during visual stimulation, highlighting robustness. This work offers a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative to ULM, enhancing fUS data interpretation and improving understanding of vessel function. Our pipeline shows high linear correlation coefficients between signals from predicted and actual compartments in both cortical and deeper regions, showcasing its ability to accurately capture blood flow dynamics."}

It is observed that existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform hierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification. Thus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it best hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates DenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for hierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal plants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed and precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model captures both local and global contextual information from the images, improving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new ones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple scales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical classification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and unknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and without background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word application. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species the model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for predicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively.

Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification (HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization despite occlusions and view changes.

This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations.

However, most existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information, they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency module to capture global frequency-domain representations.

However, the randomness of Gaussian noise distorts point-based distance measurements in classification tasks. To mitigate this issue, we propose a confidence optimization probabilistic encoding (CPE) method that improves distance reliability and enhances representation learning. Specifically, we refine probabilistic encoding with two key strategies: First, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism to adjust distance calculations, ensuring consistency and reliability in probabilistic encoding classification tasks. Second, we replace the conventional KL divergence-based variance regularization, which relies on unreliable prior assumptions, with a simpler L2 regularization term to directly constrain variance. The method we proposed is model-agnostic, and extensive experiments on natural language classification tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance and generalization on both the BERT and the RoBERTa model."}

To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or one-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps noise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by enforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous velocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a limiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first principles of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite integrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term Interval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential relationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals without resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we introduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic consistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the differential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit of our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This establishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning average velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is significantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations, resulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware compatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been successfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as Doubao), achieving speedups of 20x."}

In this work, we explore the use of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to develop adaptive control strategies for lower-limb exoskeletons, aiming to enhance mobility and autonomy for individuals with motor impairments. Inspired by prominent models of biological sensorimotor processing, our investigated HRL approach breaks down the complex task of exoskeleton control adaptation into a higher-level framework for terrain strategy adaptation and a lower-level framework for providing predictive information; this latter element is implemented via the continual learning of general value functions (GVFs). GVFs generated temporal abstractions of future signal values from multiple wearable lower-limb sensors, including electromyography, pressure insoles, and goniometers. We investigated two methods for incorporating actual and predicted sensor signals into a policy network with the intent to improve the decision-making capacity of the control system of a lower-limb exoskeleton during ambulation across varied terrains. As a key result, we found that the addition of predictions made from GVFs increased overall network accuracy. Terrain-specific performance increases were seen while walking on even ground, uneven ground, up and down ramps, and turns, terrains that are often misclassified without predictive information. This suggests that predictive information can aid decision-making during uncertainty, e.g., on terrains that have a high chance of being misclassified. This work, therefore, contributes new insights into the nuances of HRL and the future development of exoskeletons to facilitate safe transitioning and traversing across different walking environments."}

At the lower level, we train a network to approximate the local solution operator by minimizing the local operator loss with respect to the weights of the neural network. At the upper level, we sample the PDE parameters from the posterior distribution. We achieve efficient sampling through gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Compared with existing methods based on Bayesian neural networks, our approach bypasses the challenge of sampling in the high-dimensional space of neural network weights and does not require specifying a prior distribution on the neural network solution. Instead, uncertainty propagates naturally from the data through the PDE constraints. By enforcing strong PDE constraints, the proposed method improves the accuracy of both parameter inference and uncertainty quantification. We analyze the dynamic error of the gradient in the MCMC sampler and the static error in the posterior distribution due to inexact minimization of the lower level problem and demonstrate a direct link between the tolerance for solving the lower level problem and the accuracy of the resulting uncertainty quantification.

Johansson", "title": "Pragmatic Policy Development via Interpretable Behavior Cloning", "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for deriving optimal policies from observational data, but challenges related to interpretability and evaluation limit its practical use in safety-critical domains. Interpretability is hindered by the black-box nature of unconstrained RL policies, while evaluation -- typically performed off-policy -- is sensitive to large deviations from the data-collecting behavior policy, especially when using methods based on importance sampling. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from the most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an interpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which is specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural grouping of states with respect to treatment. The tree structure ensures interpretability by design, while varying the number of actions considered controls the degree of overlap with the behavior policy, enabling reliable off-policy evaluation. This pragmatic approach to policy development standardizes frequent treatment patterns, capturing the collective clinical judgment embedded in the data. Using real-world examples in rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis care, we demonstrate that policies derived under this framework can outperform current practice, offering interpretable alternatives to those obtained via offline RL."}

However, state-of-the-art generative models (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) rely on large datasets with thousands of examples. In low-data settings, often the primary motivation for synthetic data, these models can overfit, leak sensitive records, and require frequent retraining. Recent work uses large pre-trained transformers to generate rows via in-context learning (ICL), which needs only a few seed examples and no parameter updates, avoiding retraining. But ICL repeats seed rows verbatim, introducing a new privacy risk that has only been studied in text. The severity of this risk in tabular synthesis-where a single row may identify a person-remains unclear. We address this gap with the first benchmark of three foundation models (GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, TabPFN v2) against four baselines on 35 real-world tables from health, finance, and policy. We evaluate statistical fidelity, downstream utility, and membership inference leakage. Results show foundation models consistently have the highest privacy risk. LLaMA 3.3 70B reaches up to 54 percentage points higher true-positive rate at 1% FPR than the safest baseline. GPT-4o-mini and TabPFN are also highly vulnerable. We plot the privacy-utility frontier and show that CTGAN and GPT-4o-mini offer better tradeoffs. A factorial study finds that three zero-cost prompt tweaks-small batch size, low temperature, and using summary statistics-can reduce worst-case AUC by 14 points and rare-class leakage by up to 39 points while maintaining over 90% fidelity.

While it is often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI, Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small, consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis."}

However, the \"black-box\" nature of such deep learning methods adds a layer of opaqueness that hinders the proper understanding of detection decisions, trust in the decisions and prevent timely countermeasures against such attacks. Explainable AI (XAI) methods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the causes of the predictions. The majority of the existing XAI methods provide explanations which are not convenient to convert into actionable countermeasures. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based counterfactual explanation framework that can provide actionable explanations for network intrusion attacks. We evaluated our proposed algorithm against several other publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3 modern network intrusion datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work also presents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation algorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our proposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the tested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by reducing the time to generate explanations. We also demonstrate how counterfactual explanations can provide actionable explanations by summarizing them to create a set of global rules. These rules are actionable not only at instance level but also at the global level for intrusion attacks. These global counterfactual rules show the ability to effectively filter out incoming attack queries which is crucial for efficient intrusion detection and defense mechanisms."}

Treating different variables as distinct modalities and applying a \\textbf{two-stage training approach} from multimodal models can partially alleviate this issue, but due to the inconformity in training tasks between the two stages, the results are often suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose an implicit two-stage training method, configuring separate encoders and decoders for each variable. In detailed, in the first stage, the Translator is frozen while the Encoders and Decoders learn a shared latent space, in the second stage, the Encoders and Decoders are frozen, and the Translator captures inter-variable interactions for prediction. Besides, by introducing a self-attention mechanism for multivariable fusion in the latent space, the performance achieves further improvements.

In this work, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset distillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes decoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of quantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss as the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable fair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise storage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs.

Although recent studies have explored heterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying resource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and local model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address these limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split Learning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device systems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a personalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to achieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models tailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and privacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers clients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without sharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources, environmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach balances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high model accuracy. We implement and evaluate P3SL on a testbed consisting of 7 devices including 4 Jetson Nano P3450 devices, 2 Raspberry Pis, and 1 laptop, using diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental conditions."}

This pressing issue highlights the need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality), computational node capabilities, and environmental impact.This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data. Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics, and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction, minimizing environmental impact during training.

A block-wise grouping framework is further designed to limit the errors introduced by locality sensitive hashing. By optimizing the selection of block sizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining high-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive experiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than FlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention.

Extending this approach to multiple learnable vectors, we observe a natural progression toward a VQ-VAE-like model in continuous space. However, when the encoder outputs multiple vectors, the model degenerates into a discrete Autoencoder (VQ-AE), which combines image fragments without learning semantic representations.

Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines.

In recent years, neural network-based methods have shown promise because of their ability to efficiently approximate nonlinear mappings. However, most existing neural approaches are still largely limited to simple domains, which makes it difficult to apply to real-world PDEs involving complex geometries. In this paper, we propose a learning-based domain decomposition method (L-DDM) that addresses this gap. Our approach uses a single, pre-trained neural operator-originally trained on simple domains-as a surrogate model within a domain decomposition scheme, allowing us to tackle large and complicated domains efficiently. We provide a general theoretical result on the existence of neural operator approximations in the context of domain decomposition solution of abstract PDEs. We then demonstrate our method by accurately approximating solutions to elliptic PDEs with discontinuous microstructures in complex geometries, using a physics-pretrained neural operator (PPNO).

Due to its low communication requirements, distributed SGD (D-SGD) remains the mainstream optimizer in such challenging networks, but it still suffers from significant throughput reduction. To mitigate these limitations, existing approaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to alleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both challenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a complex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed synchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance under varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to dynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on static heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which prevents them from achieving this goal. This study fills in this theoretical gap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization problem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable noise terms. We are the first to reveal that staleness exponentially amplifies the negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, filling a critical gap in understanding how compressed and delayed gradients affect training. Furthermore, by integrating the convergence rate with a network-aware time minimization condition, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically adjusts the compression ratio and staleness based on the real-time network condition and training task. DeCo-SGD achieves up to 5.07 and 1.37 speed-ups over D-SGD and static strategy in high-latency and low, varying bandwidth networks, respectively."}

To bridge these gaps, we conduct an extensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive evaluations on the same ground to ensure fair comparisons. To our knowledge, this fair and extensive investigation remains critically important yet underexplored. To better understand the theoretical connections, we decouple the published quantization methods into two steps: pre-quantization transformation and quantization error mitigation. We define the former as a preprocessing step applied before quantization to reduce the impact of outliers, making the data distribution flatter and more suitable for quantization. Quantization error mitigation involves techniques that offset the errors introduced during quantization, thereby enhancing model performance. We evaluate and analyze the impact of different components of quantization methods. Additionally, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 data format and its performance.

As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is a \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to sub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the sub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these sub-problems in a naive \"first-come-first-serve\" manner, thereby suffering from an issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB, concerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples. Based on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that explores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of the verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it only changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead to a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including $Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy inspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally evaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5 models with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, we demonstrate the speedup of Oliva for up to 25X in MNIST, and up to 80X in CIFAR10."}

Existing approaches typically adopt either channel-mixing (CM) or channel-independence (CI) strategies.

CI strategy improves this aspect but fails to fully exploit cross-variable dependencies like CM. Hybrid strategies based on feature fusion offer limited generalization and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose C3RL, a novel representation learning framework that jointly models both CM and CI strategies. Motivated by contrastive learning in computer vision, C3RL treats the inputs of the two strategies as transposed views and builds a siamese network architecture: one strategy serves as the backbone, while the other complements it. By jointly optimizing contrastive and prediction losses with adaptive weighting, C3RL balances representation and forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on seven models show that C3RL boosts the best-case performance rate to 81.4\\% for models based on CI strategy and to 76.3\\% for models based on CM strategy, demonstrating strong generalization and effectiveness.

However, existing matrix CB methods fail to explore such graph information, and thereby making them difficult to generate effective decision-making policies. To fill in this void, we propose in this paper a novel matrix CB algorithmic framework that builds upon the classical upper confidence bound (UCB) framework. This new framework can effectively integrate both the low-rank structure and graph information in a unified manner. Specifically, it involves first solving a joint nuclear norm and matrix Laplacian regularization problem, followed by the implementation of a graph-based generalized linear version of the UCB algorithm.

In recent years, the convergence of federated learning and parameterized quantum circuits has sparked significant research interest, with promising implications for fields such as healthcare and finance. By enabling decentralized training of quantum models, it allows clients or institutions to collaboratively enhance model performance and outcomes while preserving data privacy. Recognizing that Fisher information can quantify the amount of information that a quantum state carries under parameter changes, thereby providing insight into its geometric and statistical properties.

Existing GCIL methods primarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed to belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge during inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a more challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two intertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs the detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which destabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems, a novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding generation to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust detection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional variational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old classes, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle unknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node embeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further proposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class prototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all unknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly models them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a robust open-set recognition.

To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly optimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting ability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding advanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging theoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust loss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses. However, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced optimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and applicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric losses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario and propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We rigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE satisfies the asymmetric condition.

In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound, revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$ robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved - whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.

The targeted optimization approach, called EGO, is based on a sequential enrichment of an adaptive surrogate model and, in this context, GP surrogate models are one of the most widely used in engineering problems to approximate time-consuming high fidelity models. EGO is a heuristic BO method that performs well in terms of solution quality. However, like any other global optimization method, EGO suffers from the curse of dimensionality, meaning that its performance is satisfactory on lower dimensional problems, but deteriorates as the dimensionality of the optimization search space increases. For realistic aircraft design problems, the typical size of the design variables can even exceed 100 and, thus, trying to solve directly the problems using EGO is ruled out. The latter is especially true when the problems involve both continuous and categorical variables increasing even more the size of the search space. In this Ph.D thesis, effective parameterization tools are investigated, including techniques like partial least squares regression, to significantly reduce the number of design variables.

Over time, user behavior on these platforms evolves, influenced by demographic attributes and the networks they form. In this study, we present a novel approach that leverages open-source models Llama-3-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, Gemma-7B-IT through prompt engineering, combined with GPT-2, BERT, and RoBERTa using a joint embedding technique, to analyze and predict the evolution of user behavior on social media over their lifetime. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of these models to forecast future stages of a user's social evolution, including network changes, future connections, and shifts in user activities. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, with GPT-2 achieving the lowest perplexity (8.21) in a Cross-modal configuration, outperforming RoBERTa (9.11) and BERT, and underscoring the importance of leveraging Cross-modal configurations for superior performance. This approach addresses critical challenges in social media, such as friend recommendations and activity predictions, offering insights into the trajectory of user behavior.

A key task in CTI mining is mapping threat descriptions to MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques. However, this process is often performed manually, requiring expert knowledge and substantial effort. Automated approaches face two major challenges: the scarcity of high-quality labeled CTI data and class imbalance, where many techniques have very few examples. While domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) such as SecureBERT have shown improved performance, most recent work focuses on model architecture rather than addressing the data limitations. In this work, we present SynthCTI, a data augmentation framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic CTI sentences for underrepresented MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques. Our method uses a clustering-based strategy to extract semantic context from training data and guide an LLM in producing synthetic CTI sentences that are lexically diverse and semantically faithful. We evaluate SynthCTI on two publicly available CTI datasets, CTI-to-MITRE and TRAM, using LLMs with different capacity. Incorporating synthetic data leads to consistent macro-F1 improvements: for example, ALBERT improves from 0.35 to 0.52 (a relative gain of 48.6\\%), and SecureBERT reaches 0.6558 (up from 0.4412).

However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication triggers and updates the model to increase robustness.

This paper introduces RevisitVD, an extensive evaluation of 17 PLMs spanning smaller code-specific PLMs and large-scale PLMs using newly constructed datasets. Specifically, we compare the performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing settings, and analyze their robustness against code normalization, abstraction, and semantic-preserving transformations.Our findings reveal that, for VD tasks, PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora. However, these models face notable challenges in real-world scenarios, such as difficulties in detecting vulnerabilities with complex dependencies, handling perturbations introduced by code normalization and abstraction, and identifying semantic-preserving vulnerable code transformations. Also, the truncation caused by the limited context windows of PLMs can lead to a non-negligible amount of labeling errors. This study underscores the importance of thorough evaluations of model performance in practical scenarios and outlines future directions to help enhance the effectiveness of PLMs for realistic VD applications."}

This paper explores the theoretical limits of distributed covariance estimation in a feature-split setting, where communication between agents is constrained. Specifically, we study a scenario in which multiple agents each observe different components of i.i.d. samples drawn from a sub-Gaussian random vector. A central server seeks to estimate the complete covariance matrix using a limited number of bits communicated by each agent. We obtain a nearly tight minimax lower bound for covariance matrix estimation under operator norm and Frobenius norm. Our main technical tool is a novel generalization of the strong data processing inequality (SDPI), termed the Conditional Strong Data Processing Inequality (C-SDPI) coefficient, introduced in this work. The C-SDPI coefficient shares key properties such as tensorization with the conventional SDPI. Crucially, it quantifies the average contraction in a state-dependent channel and can be significantly lower than the worst-case SDPI coefficient over the state input.Utilizing the doubling trick of Geng-Nair and an operator Jensen inequality, we compute this coefficient for Gaussian mixture channels. We then employ it to establish minimax lower bounds on estimation error, capturing the trade-offs among sample size, communication cost, and data dimensionality. Building on this, we present a nearly optimal estimation protocol whose sample and communication requirements match the lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Unlike much of the existing literature, our framework does not assume infinite samples or Gaussian distributions, making it broadly applicable. Finally, we extend our analysis to interactive protocols, showing interaction can significantly reduce communication requirements compared to non-interactive schemes."}

Many existing AI approaches fall short by focusing on single view inputs or single-task outputs, limiting their clinical utility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-view, multitask hybrid deep learning framework that processes all four standard mammography views and jointly predicts diagnostic labels and BI-RADS scores for each breast. Our architecture integrates a hybrid CNN VSSM backbone, combining convolutional encoders for rich local feature extraction with Visual State Space Models (VSSMs) to capture global contextual dependencies. To improve robustness and interpretability, we incorporate a gated attention-based fusion module that dynamically weights information across views, effectively handling cases with missing data. We conduct extensive experiments across diagnostic tasks of varying complexity, benchmarking our proposed hybrid models against baseline CNN architectures and VSSM models in both single task and multi task learning settings. Across all tasks, the hybrid models consistently outperform the baselines. In the binary BI-RADS 1 vs. 5 classification task, the shared hybrid model achieves an AUC of 0.9967 and an F1 score of 0.9830. For the more challenging ternary classification, it attains an F1 score of 0.7790, while in the five-class BI-RADS task, the best F1 score reaches 0.4904.

Scott", "title": "The surprising strength of weak classifiers for validating neural posterior estimates", "abstract": "Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) has emerged as a powerful approach for amortized Bayesian inference when the true posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ is intractable or difficult to sample. But evaluating the accuracy of neural posterior estimates remains challenging, with existing methods suffering from major limitations. One appealing and widely used method is the classifier two-sample test (C2ST), where a classifier is trained to distinguish samples from the true posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ versus the learned NPE approximation $q(\\theta \\mid y)$. Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its theoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a near-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best, difficult to verify. Thus a major open question is: can a weak classifier still be useful for neural posterior validation? We show that the answer is yes. Building on the work of Hu and Lei, we present several key results for a conformal variant of the C2ST, which converts any trained classifier's scores -- even those of weak or over-fitted models -- into exact finite-sample p-values. We establish two key theoretical properties of the conformal C2ST: (i) finite-sample Type-I error control, and (ii) non-trivial power that degrades gently in tandem with the error of the trained classifier. The upshot is that even weak, biased, or overfit classifiers can still yield powerful and reliable tests. Empirically, the Conformal C2ST outperforms classical discriminative tests across a wide range of benchmarks. These results reveal the under appreciated strength of weak classifiers for validating neural posterior estimates, establishing the conformal C2ST as a practical, theoretically grounded diagnostic for modern simulation-based inference."}

As an alternative, we introduce the \\emph{Conditional Localization Test} (CoLT), a principled method designed to detect discrepancies between \\( p(\\theta \\mid x) \\) and \\( q(\\theta \\mid x) \\) across the full range of conditioning inputs. Rather than relying on exhaustive comparisons or density estimation at every \\( x \\), CoLT learns a localization function that adaptively selects points $\\theta_l(x)$ where the neural posterior $q$ deviates most strongly from the true posterior $p$ for that $x$. This approach is particularly advantageous in typical simulation-based inference settings, where only a single draw \\( \\theta \\sim p(\\theta \\mid x) \\) from the true posterior is observed for each conditioning input, but where the neural posterior \\( q(\\theta \\mid x) \\) can be sampled an arbitrary number of times.

To assess how stochastic elements, specifically initial projection positions and negative sampling, impact UMAP results, we introduce \"ghosts\", or duplicates of data points representing potential positional variations due to stochasticity. We define a data point's projection as (r,d)-stable if its ghosts perturbed within a circle of radius r in the initial projection remain confined within a circle of radius d for their final positions.

Conventional neural networks offer strong predictive capabilities but produce deterministic outputs without inherent uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliability in safety-critical domains. Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), which introduce randomness, have emerged as a powerful approach for enabling intrinsic uncertainty quantification. However, traditional CMOS architectures are inherently designed for deterministic operation and actively suppress intrinsic randomness. This poses a fundamental challenge for implementing PNNs, as probabilistic processing introduces significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a Magnetic Probabilistic Computing (MPC) platform-an energy-efficient, scalable hardware accelerator that leverages intrinsic magnetic stochasticity for uncertainty-aware computing. This physics-driven strategy utilizes spintronic systems based on magnetic domain walls (DWs) and their dynamics to establish a new paradigm of physical probabilistic computing for AI. The MPC platform integrates three key mechanisms: thermally induced DW stochasticity, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR), enabling fully electrical and tunable probabilistic functionality at the device level. As a representative demonstration, we implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) inference structure and validate its functionality on CIFAR-10 classification tasks.

Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in filtering and hypothesis generation, yet suffer from hallucinations and lack grounding in structured knowledge, limiting their reliability. To address these issues, we propose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates human expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance hypothesis generation and validation. HypoChainer operates in three stages: First, exploration and contextualization -- experts use retrieval-augmented LLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction to navigate large-scale GNN predictions, assisted by interactive explanations. Second, hypothesis chain formation -- experts iteratively examine KG relationships around predictions and semantically linked entities, refining hypotheses with LLM and KG suggestions. Third, validation prioritization -- refined hypotheses are filtered based on KG-supported evidence to identify high-priority candidates for experimentation, with visual analytics further strengthening weak links in reasoning. We demonstrate HypoChainer's effectiveness through case studies in two domains and expert interviews, highlighting its potential to support interpretable, scalable, and knowledge-grounded scientific discovery."}

We validate our method across simulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools.

To address the challenges, in this paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix, PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents representation collapse.

Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform prediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and propagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical parameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method accurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without requiring simplification or interpolation.

This paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast, when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system.

In this paper, we theoretically analyze the quality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach to improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically. Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and random directions, in a query-efficient manner.

We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30 participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing human visual attention.

We compared human and ViT attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test).

For this framework, we clarify the context in which hazard ratios can be causally interpreted, and then develop a method based on Neyman orthogonality to compute debiased maximum-likelihood estimators of hazard ratios. Computing the constructed estimators is more efficient than computing those based on weighted regression with marginal structural Cox models.

In this paper, we focus on the exact and explicit computation of projections of the Hessian and higher-order derivatives on well-chosen subspaces relevant for optimization. Namely, for a given partition of the set of parameters, we compute tensors that can be seen as \"higher-order derivatives according to the partition\", at a reasonable cost as long as the number of subsets of the partition remains small. Then, we give some examples of how these tensors can be used. First, we show how to compute a learning rate per subset of parameters, which can be used for hyperparameter tuning. Second, we show how to use these tensors at order 2 to construct an optimization method that uses information contained in the Hessian. Third, we show how to use these tensors at order 3 (information contained in the third derivative of the loss) to regularize this optimization method. The resulting training step has several interesting properties, including: it takes into account long-range interactions between the layers of the trained neural network, which is usually not the case in similar methods (e.g., K-FAC); the trajectory of the optimization is invariant under affine layer-wise reparameterization."}

This motivates us to delve into a new problem: how to develop a reliable multi-view learning model under the guidance of noisy labels? We propose the Trusted Multi view Noise Refining (TMNR) method to address this challenge by modeling label noise arising from low-quality data features and easily-confused classes. TMNR employs evidential deep neural networks to construct view-specific opinions that capture both beliefs and uncertainty. These opinions are then transformed through noise correlation matrices to align with the noisy supervision, where matrix elements are constrained by sample uncertainty to reflect label reliability. Furthermore, considering the challenge of jointly optimizing the evidence network and noise correlation matrices under noisy supervision, we further propose Trusted Multi-view Noise Re-Refining (TMNR^2 ), which disentangles this complex co-training problem by establishing different training objectives for distinct modules. TMNR^2 identifies potentially mislabeled samples through evidence-label consistency and generates pseudo-labels from neighboring information. By assigning clean samples to optimize evidential networks and noisy samples to guide noise correlation matrices, respectively, TMNR^2 reduces mapping interference and achieves stabilizes training. Experimental results demonstrate that TMNR^2 significantly outperforms baseline methods, with average accuracy improvements of 7% on datasets with 50% label noise."}

We herein present UnmaskingTrees, a simple method for tabular imputation (and generation) employing gradient-boosted decision trees which are used to incrementally unmask individual features. On a benchmark for out-of-the-box performance on 27 small tabular datasets, UnmaskingTrees offers leading performance on imputation; state-of-the-art performance on generation given data with missingness; and competitive performance on vanilla generation given data without missingness. To solve the conditional generation subproblem, we propose a tabular probabilistic prediction method, BaltoBot, which fits a balanced tree of boosted tree classifiers. Unlike older methods, it requires no parametric assumption on the conditional distribution, accommodating features with multimodal distributions; unlike newer diffusion methods, it offers fast sampling, closed-form density estimation, and flexible handling of discrete variables. We finally consider our two approaches as meta-algorithms, demonstrating in-context learning-based generative modeling with TabPFN."}

Our approach, called **EnsemW2S**, employs a token-level ensemble strategy that iteratively combines multiple weak experts, systematically addressing the shortcomings identified in preceding iterations.

Woolford", "title": "Challenges learning from imbalanced data using tree-based models: Prevalence estimates systematically depend on hyperparameters and can be upwardly biased", "abstract": "Imbalanced binary classification problems arise in many fields of study. When using machine learning models for these problems, it is common to subsample the majority class (i.e., undersampling) to create a (more) balanced dataset for model training. This biases the model's predictions because the model learns from a dataset that does not follow the same data generating process as new data. One way of accounting for this bias is to analytically map the resulting predictions to new values based on the sampling rate for the majority class, which was used to create the training dataset. While this approach may work well for some machine learning models, we show that calibrating a random forest this way has unintended negative consequences, including prevalence estimates that can be upwardly biased. These prevalence estimates depend on both i) the number of predictors considered at each split in the random forest; and ii) the sampling rate used. We explain the former using known properties of random forests and analytical calibration. However, in investigating the latter issue, we made a surprising discovery - contrary to the widespread belief that decision trees are biased towards the majority class, they actually can be biased towards the minority class."}

In response to this problem, this paper introduces a novel method called attention-based multiscale temporal fusion network. The multiscale depthwise convolution and gated recurrent unit are employed to extract multiscale contextual local features and long-short-term features. Instance normalization is applied to suppress mode-specific information. Furthermore, a temporal attention mechanism is designed to focus on critical time points with higher cross-mode shared information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fault diagnosis.

EXGnet integrates XAI supervision during training via a normalized cross-correlation based loss, directing the model's attention to clinically relevant ECG regions, similar to a cardiologist's focus. This supervision is driven by automatically generated ground truth, derived through an innovative heart rate variability-based approach, without the need for manual annotation.

However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications as described by the neurosymbolic AI framework, $\\textit{SymbolicAI}$. This work contributes a hybrid-driven architecture for improving the reliability of automated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for measuring the functional integrity of its output.

These systems often rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range of scenarios and wireless channel conditions."}

ResidualPlanner is both optimal and scalable for answering marginal queries with Gaussian noise, while ResidualPlanner+ provides support for more general workloads, such as combinations of marginals and range queries or prefix-sum queries. ResidualPlanner can optimize for many loss functions that can be written as a convex function of marginal variances (prior work was restricted to just one predefined objective function). ResidualPlanner can optimize the accuracy of marginals in large scale settings in seconds, even when the previous state of the art (HDMM) runs out of memory. It even runs on datasets with 100 attributes in a couple of minutes. Furthermore, ResidualPlanner can efficiently compute variance/covariance values for each marginal (prior methods quickly run out of memory, even for relatively small datasets).ResidualPlanner+ provides support for more complex workloads that combine marginal and range/prefix-sum queries (e.g., a marginal on race, a range query on age, and a combined race/age tabulation that answers age range queries for each race).

During the training phase, our method unmixes the input into the separate encoding spaces of the multi-encoder network and then remixes these representations within the decoder for a reconstruction of the input. Then to perform source inference, we introduce a novel encoding masking technique whereby masking out all but one of the encodings enables the decoder to estimate a source signal. To this end, we also introduce a sparse mixing loss that encourages sparse remixing of source encodings throughout the decoder and a so-called zero reconstruction loss on the decoder for coherent source estimations. To analyze and evaluate our method, we conduct experiments on a toy dataset, designed to demonstrate this property of feature subspace specialization, and with real-world biosignal recordings from a polysomnography sleep study for extracting respiration from electrocardiogram and photoplethysmography signals."}

During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs.

The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token.

Unlike layout-based approaches that enforce rigid structures and limit diversity, our proposed approach offers a more flexible arrangement of the scene by imposing just the extracted constraints from the text, without any unnecessary additions. These constraints are formulated as losses-entity missing, entity mixing, attribute binding, and spatial relationships-integrated into a unified loss that is applied in the first generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce a feedback-driven system for fine-grained initial noise refinement. This system integrates a verifier that evaluates the generated image, identifies inconsistencies, and provides corrective feedback. Leveraging this feedback, our refinement method first targets the unmet constraints by refining the faulty attention maps caused by initial noise, through the optimization of selective losses associated with these constraints. Subsequently, our unified loss function is reapplied to proceed the second generation phase. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, relying solely on our proposed objective functions, significantly enhances compositionality, achieving a 24% improvement in human evaluation and a 25% gain in spatial relationships.

In practice, however, black-box functions often involve input uncertainty. To handle such cases, GP-UCB can be extended to optimize evaluation criteria known as robustness measures. However, GP-UCB-based methods for robustness measures require a trade-off parameter, $\\beta$, which, as in the original GP-UCB, must be set sufficiently large to ensure theoretical validity. In this study, we propose randomized robustness measure GP-UCB (RRGP-UCB), a novel method that samples $\\beta$ from a chi-squared-based probability distribution. This approach eliminates the need to explicitly specify $\\beta$. Notably, the expected value of $\\beta$ under this distribution is not excessively large. Furthermore, we show that RRGP-UCB provides tight bounds on the expected regret between the optimal and estimated solutions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

We propose a diffusion factor model that integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes, bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4} n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable for markets with thousands of assets.

To address these issues and enable the analysis of the effect of a large suite of physical, morphological, and geological conditions on the presence and amount of snow, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is able to estimate the SWE based on time series input of the various physical/meteorological factors as well static spatial/morphological factors.

While recent advancements in generative models have significantly improved ECG reconstruction, accurately capturing fine-grained waveform features remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose a novel PPG-to-ECG reconstruction method that leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the core network. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on single-channel PPG, our method employs a four-channel signal image representation, incorporating the original PPG, its first-order difference, second-order difference, and area under the curve. This multi-channel design enriches feature extraction by preserving both temporal and physiological variations within the PPG. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism in ViT, our approach effectively captures both inter-beat and intra-beat dependencies, leading to more robust and accurate ECG reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing 1D convolution-based approaches, achieving up to 29% reduction in PRD and 15% reduction in RMSE. The proposed approach also produces improvements in other evaluation metrics, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in reconstructing ECG signals. Furthermore, to ensure a clinically relevant evaluation, we introduce new performance metrics, including QRS area error, PR interval error, RT interval error, and RT amplitude difference error.

Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling -- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset. We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization."}

Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection.

We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework.We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments."}

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end, we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident, one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is available atthis https URL."}

However, traditional PNR systems face several challenges, including an overreliance on textual content, common neglect of short-term user interests, and significant privacy concerns due to centralized data storage. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel multimodal federated learning-based approach for news recommendation. First, it integrates both textual and visual features of news items using a multimodal model, enabling a more comprehensive representation of content. Second, it employs a time-aware model that balances users' long-term and short-term interests through multi-head self-attention networks, improving recommendation accuracy. Finally, to enhance privacy, a federated learning framework is implemented, enabling collaborative model training without sharing user data. The framework divides the recommendation model into a large server-maintained news model and a lightweight user model shared between the server and clients. The client requests news representations (vectors) and a user model from the central server, then computes gradients with user local data, and finally sends their locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The central server aggregates gradients to update the global user model and news model. The updated news model is further used to infer news representation by the server. To further safeguard user privacy, a secure aggregation algorithm based on Shamir's secret sharing is employed. Experiments on a real-world news dataset demonstrate strong performance compared to existing systems, representing a significant advancement in privacy-preserving personalized news recommendation."}

These kinds of models are typically evaluated through task success rates, which fail to capture the quality of task execution and the mode's confidence in its decisions. In this paper, we propose eight uncertainty metrics and five quality metrics specifically designed for VLA models for robotic manipulation tasks. We assess their effectiveness through a large-scale empirical study involving 908 successful task executions from three state-of-the-art VLA models across four representative robotic manipulation tasks. Human domain experts manually labeled task quality, allowing us to analyze the correlation between our proposed metrics and expert judgments. The results reveal that several metrics show moderate to strong correlation with human assessments, highlighting their utility for evaluating task quality and model confidence. Furthermore, we found that some of the metrics can discriminate between high-, medium-, and low-quality executions from unsuccessful tasks, which can be interesting when test oracles are not available.

(2) To address the criticism from use of synthetic benchmarks, we adapt a reliability check for reachability estimators on real-world benchmarks without labeled ground truth -- by varying the size of sampling units, which, in theory, should not affect the estimate.Results: These two studies together will help answer the question of whether current reachability estimators are reliable, and defines a protocol to evaluate future improvements in reachability estimation."}

Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have significantly improved automated test generation, garnering attention from both academia and industry. We revisit LLM-based unit test generation from a novel perspective by decoupling prefix generation and assertion generation. To characterize their respective challenges, we define Initialization Complexity and adopt Cyclomatic Complexity to measure the difficulty of prefix and assertion generation, revealing that the former primarily affects compilation success, while the latter influences test coverage. To address these challenges, we propose Seed&Steer, a two-step approach that combines traditional unit testing techniques with the capabilities of large language models. Seed&Steer leverages conventional unit testing tools (e.g., EvoSuite) to generate method invocations with high compilation success rates, which serve as seeds to guide LLMs in constructing effective test contexts. It then introduces branching cues to help LLMs explore diverse execution paths (e.g., normal, boundary, and exception cases) and generate assertions with high coverage. We evaluate Seed&Steer on five real-world Java projects against state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that Seed&Steer improves the compilation pass rate by approximately 7%, successfully compiling 792 and 887 previously failing cases on two LLMs. It also achieves up to ~73% branch and line coverage across focal methods of varying complexity, with coverage improvements ranging from 1.09* to 1.26*.

This restriction hinders large-scale longitudinal studies of API evolution and fine-grained analyses such as commit-level BC detection. In this paper, we introduce Roseau, a novel static analysis tool that constructs technology-agnostic API models from library code equipped with rich semantic analyses. API models can be analyzed to study API evolution and compared to identify BCs between any two versions of a library (releases, commits, branches, etc.). Unlike traditional approaches, Roseau can build API models from source code or bytecode, and is optimized for large-scale longitudinal analyses of library histories. We assess the accuracy, performance, and suitability of Roseau for longitudinal studies of API evolution, using JApiCmp and Revapi as baselines. We extend and refine an established benchmark of BCs and show that Roseau achieves higher accuracy (F1 = 0.99) than JApiCmp (F1 = 0.86) and Revapi (F1 = 0.91). We analyze 60 popular libraries from Maven Central and find that Roseau delivers excellent performance, detecting BCs between versions in under two seconds, including in libraries with hundreds of thousands of lines of code. We further illustrate the limitations of JApiCmp and Revapi for longitudinal studies and the novel analysis capabilities offered by Roseau by tracking the evolution of Google's Guava API and the introduction of BCs over 14 years and 6,839 commits, reducing analysis times from a few days to a few minutes."}

While recent TDD methods have shown promise in natural language settings, their effectiveness on code data remains largely underexplored. This gap is particularly important given code's structured syntax and distinct similarity criteria compared to natural language. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of seven state-of-the-art TDD methods on source code data, evaluating their performance across eight CodeLLMs. To support this evaluation, we introduce CodeSnitch, a function-level benchmark dataset comprising 9,000 code samples in three programming languages, each explicitly labeled as either included or excluded from CodeLLM training. Beyond evaluation on the original CodeSnitch, we design targeted mutation strategies to test the robustness of TDD methods under three distinct settings.

It involves understanding and predicting a program's execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the 7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction. When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks.

The framework also outperforms static analysis tools, with relative gains of 14.0 to 14.1 percent in accuracy and 132.2 to 201.2 percent in F1 score. Beyond improved detection performance, ExplainVulD produces explainable outputs by identifying the most influential code regions within each function, supporting transparency and trust in security triage."}

While existing empirical studies evaluate PLMs for vulnerability detection (VD), their inadequate consideration in data preparation, evaluation setups, and experimental settings undermines the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluations. This paper introduces RevisitVD, an extensive evaluation of 17 PLMs spanning smaller code-specific PLMs and large-scale PLMs using newly constructed datasets. Specifically, we compare the performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing settings, and analyze their robustness against code normalization, abstraction, and semantic-preserving transformations.Our findings reveal that, for VD tasks, PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora. However, these models face notable challenges in real-world scenarios, such as difficulties in detecting vulnerabilities with complex dependencies, handling perturbations introduced by code normalization and abstraction, and identifying semantic-preserving vulnerable code transformations. Also, the truncation caused by the limited context windows of PLMs can lead to a non-negligible amount of labeling errors. This study underscores the importance of thorough evaluations of model performance in practical scenarios and outlines future directions to help enhance the effectiveness of PLMs for realistic VD applications."}

As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is a \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to sub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the sub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these sub-problems in a naive \"first-come-first-serve\" manner, thereby suffering from an issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB, concerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples. Based on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that explores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of the verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it only changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead to a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including $Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy inspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally evaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5 models with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, we demonstrate the speedup of Oliva for up to 25X in MNIST, and up to 80X in CIFAR10."}

This study investigates how integrating DTs with penetration testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing intelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and adaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM framework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations. Initial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the effectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research demonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to meet evolving industry demands."}

Fernandes e Fizardo", "title": "Rethinking HSM and TPM Security in the Cloud: Real-World Attacks and Next-Gen Defenses", "abstract": "As organizations rapidly migrate to the cloud, the security of cryptographic key management has become a growing concern. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), traditionally seen as the gold standard for securing encryption keys and digital trust, are increasingly challenged by cloud-native threats. Real-world breaches have exposed weaknesses in cloud deployments, including misconfigurations, API abuse, and privilege escalations, allowing attackers to access sensitive key material and bypass protections. These incidents reveal that while the hardware remains secure, the surrounding cloud ecosystem introduces systemic vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes notable security failures involving HSMs and TPMs, identifies common attack vectors, and questions longstanding assumptions about their effectiveness in distributed environments. We explore alternative approaches such as confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key management. Our findings highlight that while HSMs and TPMs still play a role, modern cloud security requires more adaptive, layered architectures. By evaluating both current weaknesses and emerging models, this research equips cloud architects and security engineers with strategies to reinforce cryptographic trust in the evolving threat landscape."}

However, to further reduce the risk of similar attacks occurring, software organizations benefit from knowing what tasks mitigate attack techniques the attackers are currently using to address specific threats, prioritize tasks, and close mitigation gaps. The goal of this study is to aid software organizations in reducing the risk of software supply chain attacks by systematically synthesizing how framework tasks mitigate the attack techniques used in the SolarWinds, Log4j, and XZ Utils attacks. We qualitatively analyzed 106 Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports of the 3 attacks to gather the attack techniques. We then systematically constructed a mapping between attack techniques and the 73 tasks enumerated in 10 software supply chain frameworks. Afterward, we established and ranked priority tasks that mitigate attack techniques. The three mitigation tasks with the highest scores are role-based access control, system monitoring, and boundary protection. Additionally, three mitigation tasks were missing from all ten frameworks, including sustainable open-source software and environmental scanning tools. Thus, software products would still be vulnerable to software supply chain attacks even if organizations adopted all recommended tasks."}

While prior research has focused on unintended vulnerabilities, this study examines a more direct threat: open-source LLMs generating vulnerable code when prompted. We propose a dual experimental design: (1) Dynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user persona, and prompt phrasing across structured templates; and (2) Reverse Prompting, which derives natural-language prompts from real vulnerable code samples. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral, Gemma) using static analysis to assess both the presence and correctness of generated vulnerabilities. Our results show that all models frequently generate the requested vulnerabilities, though with significant performance differences. Gemma achieves the highest correctness for memory vulnerabilities under Dynamic Prompting (e.g., 98.6% for buffer overflows), while Qwen2 demonstrates the most balanced performance across all tasks. We find that professional personas (e.g., \"DevOps Engineer\") consistently elicit higher success rates than student personas, and that the effectiveness of direct versus indirect phrasing is inverted depending on the prompting strategy. Vulnerability reproduction accuracy follows a non-linear pattern with code complexity, peaking in a moderate range. Our findings expose how LLMs' reliance on pattern recall over semantic reasoning creates significant blind spots in their safety alignments, particularly for requests framed as plausible professional tasks."}

While its strictest form, Unique-Cause MC/DC, offers the highest assurance, research on its efficient test generation has been lacking. This gap is particularly significant, as an analysis of large-scale avionics systems shows that 99.7% of all conditional decisions are, in fact, Singular Boolean Expressions (SBEs) the ideal structure for applying Unique-Cause MC/DC. This paper proposes 'Robin's Rule', a deterministic algorithm that directly constructs a minimal test set of N + 1 cases to guarantee 100% Unique-Cause MC/DC for SBEs with N conditions, without generating a full truth table. To validate our approach, we constructed a benchmark by reformulating the TCAS-II specifications into SBEs and verified the results using an industry-standard, certified commercial tool. The results confirm that our method consistently achieves 100% coverage with the theoretical minimum number of tests and is more efficient than the commercial tool. This work provides a practical and provably optimal solution for verifying safety-critical systems, ensuring both rigor and efficiency."}

To support this shift, scalable protocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic tool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and repetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and configure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims to eliminate.This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully automated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged GitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include servers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive scaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates MCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API definitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema registration and authentication handling.We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across over 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded out of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all attributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After minor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9% success.Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server development, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality issues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a corpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common specification flaws."}

The public currently lacks adequate information about train-test overlap: most models have no public train-test overlap statistics, and third parties cannot directly measure train-test overlap since they do not have access to the training data. To make this clear, we document the practices of 30 model developers, finding that just 9 developers report train-test overlap: 4 developers release training data under open-source licenses, enabling the community to directly measure train-test overlap, and 5 developers publish their train-test overlap methodology and statistics. By engaging with language model developers, we provide novel information about train-test overlap for three additional developers. Overall, we take the position that language model developers should publish train-test overlap statistics and/or training data whenever they report evaluation results on public test sets. We hope our work increases transparency into train-test overlap to increase the community-wide trust in model evaluations."}

Sadik,Sebastian Brulin,Markus Olhofer", "title": "LLM as a code generator in Agile Model Driven Development", "abstract": "Leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT4 in the auto generation of code represents a significant advancement, yet it is not without its challenges. The ambiguity inherent in natural language descriptions of software poses substantial obstacles to generating deployable, structured artifacts. This research champions Model Driven Development (MDD) as a viable strategy to overcome these challenges, proposing an Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD) approach that employs GPT4 as a code generator. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the code auto generation process and offers agility that allows seamless adaptation to changes in models or deployment environments. We illustrate this by modeling a multi agent Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), significantly reducing model ambiguity by integrating the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for code structure meta modeling, and the FIPA ontology language for communication semantics meta modeling. Applying GPT4 auto generation capabilities yields Java and Python code that is compatible with the JADE and PADE frameworks, respectively. Our thorough evaluation of the auto generated code verifies its alignment with expected behaviors and identifies enhancements in agent interactions. Structurally, we assessed the complexity of code derived from a model constrained solely by OCL meta models, against that influenced by both OCL and FIPA ontology meta models. The results indicate that the ontology constrained meta model produces inherently more complex code, yet its cyclomatic complexity remains within manageable levels, suggesting that additional meta model constraints can be incorporated without exceeding the high risk threshold for complexity."}
