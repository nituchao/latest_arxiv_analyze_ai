The workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later, these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence: openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision, recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE) progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches."}

We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation (N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents."}

Commonly, the Zadeh's extension rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers.

In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a standardized metric of medication coverage, \\emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study (25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and record-level exact-match accuracy.

A brief error review highlights three common issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms, handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g., ``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle, site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence, and retention in real-world settings."}

Drawing on recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism - such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified, particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL), single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components, including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems, advancing the development of autonomous GIS."}

However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration. To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e., an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented baselines by up to $11.85\\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the average reasoning length by $51.60\\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches."}

While existing attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG, they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning, a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons. Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time, Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

Adaptive Prompting and Reasoning through Evolutionary Domain Knowledge Adaptation", "abstract": "Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG) descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs, EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves 7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost.

We define PIF as a task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options, each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation, content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity."}

However, in real deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts, static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead, making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications."}

Shylock can reduce the number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and generated datasets.

To systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts. This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs. Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs."}

However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc. However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated, multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning: Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly, defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories, synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks of different complexity.

For this reason, we offer a framework integrating reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in mathematical reasoning."}

NeSy AI approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms, architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for future research.

However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants, each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers, each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers. Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant. Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation, we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES over prior methods."}

Co-Sight addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification (CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability. TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent, source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop, where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically, Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%).

However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a constraint function that classifies the states of the system under consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF.

Rigorous evaluation of these agents is critical for progress.

The scientific community is divided between physicalism and natural dualism. Physicalism posits consciousness is a physical process that can be modeled computationally; natural dualism rejects this hypothesis. Finding a computational model has proven elusive, particularly because of conflation of consciousness with other cognitive capabilities exhibited by humans, such as intelligence and physiological sensations. Here we show such a computational model that precisely models consciousness, natural or artificial, identifying the structural and functional mechanisms that effect it, confirming the physicalism hypothesis. We found such a model is obtainable when including the underlying (biological or digital) substrate and accounting for reactive behavior in substrate sub-systems (e.g., autonomous physiological responses). Results show that, unlike all other computational processes, consciousness is not independent of its substrate and possessing it is an evolutionary advantage for intelligent entities. Our result shows there is no impediment to the realization of fully artificial consciousness but, surprisingly, that it is also possible to realize artificial intelligence of arbitrary level without consciousness whatsoever, and that there is no advantage in imbuing artificial systems with consciousness."}

Prior work has typically compared systems using a single representational similarity metric, yet each captures only one facet of representational structure. To address this, we leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics-each capturing a distinct facet of representational correspondence, such as geometry, unit-level tuning, or linear decodability-and assess brain region or model separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics that preserve geometric or tuning structure (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield stronger region-based discrimination, whereas more flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show weaker separation. These findings suggest that geometry and tuning encode brain-region- or model-family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information tends to be more globally shared across regions or models. To integrate these complementary representational facets, we adapt Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), a framework originally developed for multi-omics data integration. SNF produces substantially sharper regional and model family-level separation than any single metric and yields robust composite similarity profiles. Moreover, clustering cortical regions using SNF-derived similarity scores reveals a clearer hierarchical organization that aligns closely with established anatomical and functional hierarchies of the visual cortex-surpassing the correspondence achieved by individual metrics."}

CESAR resolves test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots\", where performance peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs."}

Conventional approaches often force weak modalities to align with dominant ones in \"Learning to be (the same)\" (Positive Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm: \"Learning Not to be\" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities' target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities, particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios.

Given limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration (asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next, to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs, such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost.

These adapters are typically trained to capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training, confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what should NOT be learned."}

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze Suricata IDS logs and infer attacker actions in terms of MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that attacker behavior reflects underlying cognitive biases such as loss aversion, risk tolerance, or goal persistence that can be extracted and modeled through careful observation of log sequences. This lays the groundwork for future work on behaviorally adaptive cyber defense and cognitive trait inference. We develop a strategy-driven prompt system to segment large amounts of network logs data into distinct behavioral phases in a highly efficient manner, enabling the LLM to associate each phase with likely techniques and underlying cognitive motives. By mapping network-layer events to high-level attacker strategies, our method reveals how behavioral signals such as tool switching, protocol transitions, or pivot patterns correspond to psychologically meaningful decision points. The results demonstrate that LLMs can bridge the semantic gap between packet-level logs and strategic intent, offering a pathway toward cognitive-adaptive cyber defense.Keywords: Cognitive Cybersecurity, Large Language Models (LLMs), Cyberpsychology, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), MITRE ATT&CK, Cognitive Biases"}

Convolutional neural networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges. To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations across scales.

Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49 neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%) baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings.

Our results reveal a clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical use.

The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete structures.

We propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph, yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs.

However, SFT, being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods.

As environments grow more realistic, belief distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and downstream decision quality."}

Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class counts.

In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions, facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors.

Such synchronization requirement introduces significant time latency, making straggler a critical bottleneck to the scalability and efficiency of the system. To mitigate this problem, we propose MU-SplitFed, a straggler-resilient SFL algorithm in zeroth-order optimization that decouples training progress from straggler delays via a simple yet effective unbalanced update mechanism.By enabling the server to perform $\\tau$ local updates per client round, MU-SplitFed achieves a convergence rate of $O(\\sqrt{d/(\\tau T)})$ for non-convex objectives, demonstrating a linear speedup of $\\tau$ in communication rounds.

When explicit knowledge of the environment is unavailable, geometry-aware feature extraction from channel state information (CSI) emerges as a pivotal methodology to bridge physical-layer measurements with network intelligence. This paper proposes to explore the received signal strength (RSS) data, without explicit 3D environment knowledge, to jointly construct the radio beam map and environmental geometry for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Unlike existing methods that only learn blockage structures, we propose an oriented virtual obstacle model that captures the geometric features of both blockage and reflection. Reflective zones are formulated to identify relevant reflected paths according to the geometry relation of the environment. We derive an analytical expression for the reflective zone and further analyze its geometric characteristics to develop a reformulation that is more compatible with deep learning representations. A physics-informed deep learning framework that incorporates the reflective-zone-based geometry model is proposed to learn the blockage, reflection, and scattering components, along with the beam pattern, which leverages physics prior knowledge to enhance network transferability. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in addition to reconstructing the blockage and reflection geometry, the proposed model can construct a more accurate MIMO beam map with a 32%-48% accuracy improvement."}

This expense stems primarily from the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency. Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (\\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets, demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\\times$ in long-context prefilling, confirming its practical viability.

They typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs. This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions.

The key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments."}

Existing convergence theories for adaptive optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g., moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions, explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to its reliance on $\\beta_2 \\to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory."}

In this study, we present a computational model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate odor discrimination under varying noise conditions that simulate complex environments. Our results show that LI primarily enhances odor discrimination in low- and medium-noise scenarios, but this benefit diminishes and may reverse under higher-noise conditions. In contrast, SFA consistently improves discrimination across all noise levels. LI is preferentially engaged in low- and medium-noise environments, whereas SFA dominates in high-noise settings.

TripTide models key dimensions such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial, and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality.

Our experiments show that LLMs maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones, indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence.

However, their convolution operations process multi-channel inputs independently, limiting the ability to capture correlations among channels. This can lead to suboptimal feature learning, particularly for complex audio patterns such as multi-channel spectrogram representations. Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) address this limitation by employing quaternion algebra to jointly capture inter-channel dependencies, enabling more compact models with fewer learnable parameters while better exploiting the multi-dimensional nature of audio signals. However, QCNNs exhibit higher computational complexity due to the overhead of quaternion operations, resulting in increased inference latency and reduced efficiency compared to conventional CNNs, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. To address this challenge, this study explores knowledge distillation (KD) and pruning, to reduce the computational complexity of QCNNs while maintaining performance. Our experiments on audio classification reveal that pruning QCNNs achieves similar or superior performance compared to KD while requiring less computational effort. Compared to conventional CNNs and Transformer-based architectures, pruned QCNNs achieve competitive performance with a reduced learnable parameter count and computational complexity. On the AudioSet dataset, pruned QCNNs reduce computational cost by 50\\% and parameter count by 80\\%, while maintaining performance comparable to the conventional CNNs. Furthermore, pruned QCNNs generalize well across multiple audio classification benchmarks, including GTZAN for music genre recognition, ESC-50 for environmental sound classification and RAVDESS for speech emotion recognition."}

This work presents an application-grounded user study with eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring, (ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \\textit{start} of scoring or as a post-hoc quality-control (\\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance improvements of approximately 30\\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by most participants.

Iterative, feedback-based methods partially address these, but they are limited to local search, hindering the discovery of a global optimum. This paper introduces REvolution, a framework that combines Evolutionary Computation (EC) with LLMs for automatic RTL generation and optimization. REvolution evolves a population of candidates in parallel, each defined by a design strategy, RTL implementation, and evaluation feedback. The framework includes a dual-population algorithm that divides candidates into Fail and Success groups for bug fixing and PPA optimization, respectively. An adaptive mechanism further improves search efficiency by dynamically adjusting the selection probability of each prompt strategy according to its success rate. Experiments on the VerilogEval and RTLLM benchmarks show that REvolution increased the initial pass rate of various LLMs by up to 24.0 percentage points. The DeepSeek-V3 model achieved a final pass rate of 95.5\\%, comparable to state-of-the-art results, without the need for separate training or domain-specific tools.

Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain."}

This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.

A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application.

In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large scale fine grained pretraining.

We further incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning capability.

This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos.

In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples).

Using aerial imagery from Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping (HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii) faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black ice and rocks.

To determine optimal injection weights adaptively, TEM employs a bi-level optimization strategy. The proposed TEM is a plug-and-play method that can be integrated with existing Transformer-based TSF methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating TEM with a variety of existing methods significantly improves their predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of explicitly preserving original token-level topology.

Deep reinforcement learning has become a major research focus due to its advantages in data acquisition and interpretability. However, current models often overlook collaboration, which affects not only impacts overall traffic efficiency but also hinders the vehicle's own normal driving in the long run. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes a method named Mix Q-learning for Lane Changing(MQLC) that integrates a hybrid value Q network, taking into account both collective and individual benefits for the greater good. At the collective level, our method coordinates the individual Q and global Q networks by utilizing global information. This enables agents to effectively balance their individual interests with the collective benefit. At the individual level, we integrated a deep learning-based intent recognition module into our observation and enhanced the decision network. These changes provide agents with richer decision information and more accurate feature extraction for improved lane-changing decisions. This strategy enables the multi-agent system to learn and formulate optimal decision-making strategies effectively. Our MQLC model, through extensive experimental results, impressively outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-agent decision-making methods, achieving significantly safer and faster lane-changing decisions.

Here, we introduce FOND (Free energy Online Natural-gradient Dynamics), a framework that derives neural inference dynamics from three principles: (1) natural gradients on F, (2) online belief updating, and (3) iterative refinement. We apply FOND to derive iP-VAE (iterative Poisson variational autoencoder), a recurrent spiking neural network that performs variational inference through membrane potential dynamics, replacing amortized encoders with iterative inference updates. Theoretically, iP-VAE yields several desirable features such as emergent normalization via lateral competition, and hardware-efficient integer spike count representations. Empirically, iP-VAE outperforms both standard VAEs and Gaussian-based predictive coding models in sparsity, reconstruction, and biological plausibility, and scales to complex color image datasets such as CelebA. iP-VAE also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution inputs, exceeding hybrid iterative-amortized VAEs. These results demonstrate how deriving inference algorithms from first principles can yield concrete architectures that are simultaneously biologically plausible and empirically effective."}

However, they fail to plan reliably, even when prompted with a detailed definition of the planning task. Attempts to improve their planning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought prompting, fine-tuning, and explicit \"reasoning\" still yield incorrect plans and usually fail to generalize to larger tasks. In this paper, we show how to use LLMs to generate correct plans, even for out-of-distribution tasks of increasing size. For a given planning domain, we ask an LLM to generate several domain-dependent heuristic functions in the form of Python code, evaluate them on a set of training tasks within a greedy best-first search, and choose the strongest one. The resulting LLM-generated heuristics solve many more unseen test tasks than state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics for classical planning. They are even competitive with the strongest learning algorithm for domain-dependent planning. These findings are especially remarkable given that our proof-of-concept implementation is based on an unoptimized Python planner and the baselines all build upon highly optimized C++ code. In some domains, the LLM-generated heuristics expand fewer states than the baselines, revealing that they are not only efficiently computable, but sometimes even more informative than the state-of-the-art heuristics. Overall, our results show that sampling a set of planning heuristic function programs can significantly improve the planning capabilities of LLMs."}

However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model.

A formal verification system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large language models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair viaLLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, model-agnostic agentic framework that combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation results at a low token and sampling budgets. Apollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 84.9% among sub 8B-parameter models (as of August 2025) while keeping the sampling budget below one hundred. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving."}

This suggests a limited degree of metacognition - the capacity to monitor one's own cognitive processes for subsequent reporting and self-control. Metacognition enhances LLMs' capabilities in solving complex tasks but also raises safety concerns, as models may obfuscate their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight (e.g., safety detector). Given society's increased reliance on these models, it is critical that we understand their metacognitive abilities. To address this, we introduce a neuroscience-inspired neurofeedback paradigm that uses in-context learning to quantify metacognitive abilities of LLMs to report and control their activation patterns. We demonstrate that their abilities depend on several factors: the number of in-context examples provided, the semantic interpretability of the neural activation direction (to be reported/controlled), and the variance explained by that direction. These directions span a \"metacognitive space\" with dimensionality much lower than the model's neural space, suggesting LLMs can monitor only a small subset of their neural activations. Our paradigm provides empirical evidence to quantify metacognition in LLMs, with significant implications for AI safety (e.g., adversarial attack and defense)."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce SPARKLE, a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the effects of RL across three key dimensions: (1) plan following and execution, (2) knowledge integration, and (3) chain of subproblems. Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance, providing models with explicit human-crafted, step-by-step plans can surprisingly degrade performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than base or SFT models. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we observe that RL enhances models' ability to integrate provided knowledge into their reasoning process, yielding consistent gains across diverse tasks. Finally, we study whether difficult problems -- those yielding no RL signals and mixed-quality reasoning traces -- can still be effectively used for training. We introduce SparkleRL-PSS, a multi-stage RL pipeline that reuses hard problems with partial step scaffolding, guiding exploration effectively without additional data generation.

Existing approaches of training guard models rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios.

Fast-MCTD integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or improving planning performance.

Second, an abstention policy decides whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human intervention. Moreover, to overcome static policies and accommodate changing task difficulty, we incorporate an online learning mechanism which uses human feedback. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and MMLU) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results demonstrate that our cascaded strategy outperforms single-model baselines in most cases, achieving higher accuracy while reducing costs and providing a principled approach to handling abstentions."}

Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models."}

To ensure LLMs do not assist with harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the \"Safety Tax\". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs--with safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning--without compromising their reasoning abilities. Our ablation studies further identify three key factors in LoRA: (1) rank-$1$ updates are sufficient to achieve the best reasoning and safety performance, (2) the up projection layers are the most critical modules, with LoRA applied to them alone achieving even better results, and (3) middle layers are more effective than early or late layers. Together, these findings show that strong safety and reasoning can be achieved at minimal computational cost when updates are applied in the right places. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. Finally, while our attempts to further reduce this overlap yield only modest improvements on some tasks, they highlight the potential of developing methods that more reliably optimize the reasoning-safety tradeoff."}

Current practice, however, focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also faces practical limitations from black-box autoregressive reasoning, where decisions unfold token by token without explicit simulation or counterfactual evaluation of outcomes. Humans, on the other hand, reason and plan by mentally simulating the consequences of actions within an internal model of the world -- a capability that supports flexible, goal-directed behavior across diverse contexts. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of an optimal agent in any general environment, SimuRA addresses the limitations of black-box autoregressive reasoning by incorporating the world model for planning via simulation. Our prototype world model is implemented using LLMs as a substrate, leveraging the natural language as a discrete, hierarchical representation grounded in concepts for planning, while remaining model-agnostic. On complex web-browsing tasks such as flight search, SimuRA improves the success rate from 0% to 32.2% compared to a representative open-web agent baseline. Across tasks, world-model-based planning achieves up to 124% higher task completion rates than a matched black-box autoregressive baseline, demonstrating the advantages of simulative reasoning.

Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form.

This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. In addition, our framework can successfully adapt to and improve reasoning datasets represented by AIME-2024.

While the majority of related work on memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation, approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative estimate of $10\\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set, distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's original dataset."}

This paper presents a unified framework called Explainability-driven Detection, Identification, and Transformation (EDIT) to strengthen inference-time defenses. EDIT integrates explainability tools, including attention maps and integrated gradients, with frequency-based features to automatically detect and identify adversarial perturbations while offering insight into model behavior. After detection, EDIT refines adversarial inputs using an optimal transformation process that leverages pre-trained embeddings and model feedback to replace corrupted tokens. To enhance security assurance, EDIT incorporates automated alerting mechanisms that involve human analysts when necessary.Beyond static defenses, EDIT also provides adaptive resilience by enforcing internal feature similarity and transforming inputs, thereby disrupting the attackers optimization process and limiting the effectiveness of adaptive adversarial attacks. Experiments using BERT and RoBERTa on IMDB, YELP, AGNEWS, and SST2 datasets against seven word substitution attacks demonstrate that EDIT achieves an average Fscore of 89.69 percent and balanced accuracy of 89.70 percent.

This is practiced even in artificial Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which are touted as consistent with neurobiology, in spite of processing in the brain being in fact asynchronous. A truly asynchronous system however would allow all neurons to evaluate concurrently their threshold and emit spikes upon receiving any presynaptic current. Omitting layer synchronization is potentially beneficial, for latency and energy efficiency, but asynchronous execution of models previously trained with layer synchronization may entail a mismatch in network dynamics and performance. We present and quantify this problem, and show that models trained with layer synchronization either perform poorly in absence of the synchronization, or fail to benefit from any energy and latency reduction, when such a mechanism is in place. We then explore a potential solution direction, based on a generalization of backpropagation-based training that integrates knowledge about an asynchronous execution scheduling strategy, for learning models suitable for asynchronous processing. We experiment with two asynchronous neuron execution scheduling strategies in datasets that encode spatial and temporal information, and we show the potential of asynchronous processing to use less spikes (up to 50%), complete inference faster (up to 2x), and achieve competitive or even better accuracy (up to 10% higher). Our exploration affirms that asynchronous event-based AI processing can be indeed more efficient, but we need to rethink how we train our SNN models to benefit from it.

In this work, we establish global optimality guarantees of PG methods for RLGU in which the objective is a general concave utility function of the state-action occupancy measure. In the tabular setting, we provide global optimality results using a new proof technique building on recent theoretical developments on the convergence of PG methods for standard RL using gradient domination. Our proof technique opens avenues for analyzing policy parameterizations beyond the direct policy parameterization for RLGU. In addition, we provide global optimality results for large state-action space settings beyond prior work which has mostly focused on the tabular setting. In this large scale setting, we adapt PG methods by approximating occupancy measures within a function approximation class using maximum likelihood estimation. Our sample complexity only scales with the dimension induced by our approximation class instead of the size of the state-action space."}

However, the learnability of these simulators from observational data has remained an open question. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that linear attention may be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. As a consequence, the problem of learning any linear transformer may be converted into the problem of learning an ordinary linear predictor in an expanded feature space, and any such predictor may be converted back into a multiheaded linear transformer. Moving to generalization, we show how to efficiently identify training datasets for which every empirical risk minimizer is equivalent (up to trivial symmetries) to the linear Transformer that generated the data, thereby guaranteeing the learned model will correctly generalize across all inputs. Finally, we provide examples of computations expressible via linear attention and therefore polynomial-time learnable, including associative memories, finite automata, and a class of Universal Turing Machine (UTMs) with polynomially bounded computation histories. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on three tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata. Our findings bridge a critical gap between theoretical expressivity and learnability of Transformers, and show that flexible and general models of computation are efficiently learnable."}

To this end, these studies employed LLMs to generate preference trees via Tree-of-thoughts (ToT) and sample the paired preference responses required by the DPO algorithm. However, the DPO algorithm based on binary preference optimization is unable to learn multiple responses with varying degrees of preference/dispreference that provided by the preference trees, resulting in incomplete preference learning. In this work, we introduce Tree Preference Optimization (TPO), that does not sample paired preference responses from the preference tree; instead, it directly learns from the entire preference tree during the fine-tuning. Specifically, TPO formulates the language model alignment as a Preference List Ranking problem, where the policy can potentially learn more effectively from a ranked preference list of responses given the prompt. In addition, to further assist LLMs in identifying discriminative steps within long-chain reasoning and increase the relative reward margin in the preference list, TPO utilizes Adaptive Step Reward to adjust the reward values of each step in trajectory for performing fine-grained preference optimization. We carry out extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks to evaluate TPO. The experimental results indicate that TPO consistently outperforms DPO across five public large language models on four datasets. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL."}

This reveals that conventional rotation-invariant assumptions are insufficient to capture Adam's advantages theoretically. To better understand the rotation-dependent properties that benefit Adam, we also identify structured rotations that preserve or even enhance its empirical performance. We then examine the rotation-dependent assumptions in the literature and find that they fall short in explaining Adam's behaviour across various rotation types. In contrast, we verify the orthogonality of the update as a promising indicator of Adam's basis sensitivity, suggesting it may be the key quantity for developing rotation-dependent theoretical frameworks that better explain its empirical success."}

We call a network untrainable when it overfits, underfits, or converges to poor results even when tuning their hyperparameters. For example, fully connected networks overfit on object recognition while deep convolutional networks without residual connections underfit. The traditional answer is to change the architecture to impose some inductive bias, although the nature of that bias is unknown. We introduce guidance, where a guide network steers a target network using a neural distance function. The target minimizes its task loss plus a layerwise representational similarity against the frozen guide. If the guide is trained, this transfers over the architectural prior and knowledge of the guide to the target. If the guide is untrained, this transfers over only part of the architectural prior of the guide. We show that guidance prevents FCN overfitting on ImageNet, narrows the vanilla RNN-Transformer gap, boosts plain CNNs toward ResNet accuracy, and aids Transformers on RNN-favored tasks. We further identify that guidance-driven initialization alone can mitigate FCN overfitting. Our method provides a mathematical tool to investigate priors and architectures, and in the long term, could automate architecture design."}

It is worth noting that, the operation of mechanical equipment is accompanied by changes in factors such as speed and load, leading to significant differences in data distribution, which pose challenges for fault diagnosis. Additionally, in terms of application deployment, commonly used cloud-based fault diagnosis methods often encounter issues such as time delays and data security concerns, while common fault diagnosis methods cannot be directly applied to edge computing devices. Therefore, conducting fault diagnosis under cross-operating conditions based on edge computing holds significant research value. This paper proposes a domain-adaptation-based lightweight fault diagnosis framework tailored for edge computing scenarios. Incorporating the local maximum mean discrepancy into knowledge transfer aligns the feature distributions of different domains in a high-dimensional feature space, to discover a common feature space across domains. The acquired fault diagnosis expertise from the cloud-based deep neural network model is transferred to the lightweight edge-based model (edge model) using adaptation knowledge transfer methods.

However, current PAE generation studies show limited adaptive attacking ability to diverse and varying scenes, revealing the urgent requirement of dynamic PAEs that are generated in real time and conditioned on the observation from the attacker. The key challenge in generating dynamic PAEs is learning the sparse relation between PAEs and the observation of attackers under the noisy feedback of attack training. To address the challenge, we present DynamicPAE, the first generative framework that enables scene-aware real-time physical attacks. Specifically, to address the noisy feedback problem that obfuscates the exploration of scene-related PAEs, we introduce the residual-guided adversarial pattern exploration technique. Residual-guided training, which relaxes the attack training with a reconstruction task, is proposed to enrich the feedback information, thereby achieving a more comprehensive exploration of PAEs. To address the alignment problem between the trained generator and the real-world scenario, we introduce the distribution-matched attack scenario alignment, consisting of the conditional-uncertainty-aligned data module and the skewness-aligned objective re-weighting module. The former aligns the training environment with the incomplete observation of the real-world attacker. The latter facilitates consistent stealth control across different attack targets with the skewness controller.

Therefore, testing LLM even after alignment efforts remains crucial for detecting any residual deviations with respect to ethical standards. We present EvoTox, an automated testing framework for LLMs' inclination to toxicity, providing a way to quantitatively assess how much LLMs can be pushed towards toxic responses even in the presence of alignment. The framework adopts an iterative evolution strategy that exploits the interplay between two LLMs, the System Under Test (SUT) and the Prompt Generator steering SUT responses toward higher toxicity. The toxicity level is assessed by an automated oracle based on an existing toxicity classifier. We conduct a quantitative and qualitative empirical evaluation using five state-of-the-art LLMs as evaluation subjects having increasing complexity (7-671B parameters). Our quantitative evaluation assesses the cost-effectiveness of four alternative versions of EvoTox against existing baseline methods, based on random search, curated datasets of toxic prompts, and adversarial attacks. Our qualitative assessment engages human evaluators to rate the fluency of the generated prompts and the perceived toxicity of the responses collected during the testing sessions. Results indicate that the effectiveness, in terms of detected toxicity level, is significantly higher than the selected baseline methods (effect size up to 1.0 against random search and up to 0.99 against adversarial attacks).

However, existing methods focus on segmenting the video into fixed frames, which disrupts the temporal continuity of sub-actions resulting in unavoidable prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel action quality assessment method through hierarchically pose-guided multi-stage contrastive regression. Firstly, we introduce a multi-scale dynamic visual-skeleton encoder to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal visual and skeletal features. Then, a procedure segmentation network is introduced to separate different sub-actions and obtain segmented features. Afterwards, the segmented visual and skeletal features are both fed into a multi-modal fusion module as physics structural priors, to guide the model in learning refined activity similarities and variances. Finally, a multi-stage contrastive learning regression approach is employed to learn discriminative representations and output prediction results.

To our knowledge, GoRA is the first method that not only addresses the limitations of prior approaches--which often focus on either rank selection or initialization in isolation--but also unifies both aspects within a single framework, enabling more effective and efficient adaptation. Extensive experiments across various architectures and modalities show that GoRA consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based methods while preserving the efficiency of vanilla LoRA. For example, when fine-tuning Llama3.1-8B-Base for mathematical reasoning, GoRA achieves a 5.13-point improvement over standard LoRA and even outperforms full fine-tuning by 2.05 points under high-rank settings.

However, the rapid pace of their deployment has outpaced a comprehensive understanding of their internal mechanisms and a delineation of their capabilities and limitations. A desired attribute of an intelligent system is its ability to recognize the scope of its own knowledge. To investigate whether LLMs embody this characteristic, we develop a benchmark designed to challenge these models to enumerate all information they possess on specific topics. This benchmark evaluates whether the models recall excessive, insufficient, or the precise amount of information, thereby indicating their awareness of their own knowledge. Our findings reveal that all tested LLMs, given sufficient scale, demonstrate an understanding of how much they know about specific topics. While different architectures exhibit varying rates of this capability's emergence, the results suggest that awareness of knowledge may be a generalizable attribute of LLMs. Further research is needed to confirm this potential and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms."}

Recent studies attempt to address this by connecting the training of VQVAE (for autoregressive generation) and CLIP (for understanding) to build a unified tokenizer. However, directly combining these training objectives has been observed to cause severe loss conflicts. In this paper, we show that reconstruction and semantic supervision do not inherently conflict. Instead, the underlying bottleneck stems from limited representational capacity of discrete token space. Building on these insights, we introduce UniTok, a unified tokenizer featuring a novel multi-codebook quantization mechanism that effectively scales up the vocabulary size and bottleneck dimension. In terms of final performance, UniTok sets a new record of 0.38 rFID and 78.6% zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet. Besides, UniTok can be seamlessly integrated into MLLMs to unlock native visual generation capability, without compromising the understanding performance.

Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the \"grokking\" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by incorporating entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training.

In this paper, we show first that BLEU, a basic string-matching metric, surprisingly matches strong reward models in agreement with human preferences on general instruction-following datasets. Based on this insight, we develop BLEUBERI, a method that first identifies challenging instructions and then applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using BLEU directly as the reward function. We demonstrate that BLEUBERI-trained models are competitive with models trained via reward model-guided RL across four challenging instruction-following benchmarks and three different base language models. A human evaluation further supports that the quality of BLEUBERI model outputs is on par with those from reward model-aligned models. Moreover, BLEUBERI models generate outputs that are more factually grounded than competing methods.

Such sensory conflicts test perception, yet humans reliably resolve them by prioritizing sound over misleading visuals. Despite advances in multimodal AI integrating vision and audio, little is known about how these systems handle cross-modal conflicts or whether they favor one modality. In this study, we systematically examine modality bias and conflict resolution in AI sound localization. We assess leading multimodal models and benchmark them against human performance in psychophysics experiments across six audiovisual conditions, including congruent, conflicting, and absent cues. Humans consistently outperform AI, demonstrating superior resilience to conflicting or missing visuals by relying on auditory information. In contrast, AI models often default to visual input, degrading performance to near chance levels. To address this, we propose a neuroscience-inspired model, EchoPin, which uses a stereo audio-image dataset generated via 3D simulations. Even with limited training data, EchoPin surpasses existing benchmarks. Notably, it also mirrors human-like horizontal localization bias favoring left-right precision-likely due to the stereo audio structure reflecting human ear placement.

It is now routinely used for robust inference with heavy-tailed data, bandwidth selection, and other large-sample applications. Despite its broad applicability across econometrics, biostatistics, and machine learning, rigorous parameter-free guarantees for the soundness of the m-out-of-n bootstrap when estimating sample quantiles have remained elusive.This paper establishes such guarantees by analyzing the estimator of sample quantiles obtained from m-out-of-n resampling of a dataset of size n. We first prove a central limit theorem for a fully data-driven version of the estimator that holds under a mild moment condition and involves no unknown nuisance parameters. We then show that the moment assumption is essentially tight by constructing a counter-example in which the CLT fails. Strengthening the assumptions slightly, we derive an Edgeworth expansion that provides exact convergence rates and, as a corollary, a Berry Esseen bound on the bootstrap approximation error. Finally, we illustrate the scope of our results by deriving parameter-free asymptotic distributions for practical statistics, including the quantiles for random walk Metropolis-Hastings and the rewards of ergodic Markov decision processes, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of our theory in modern estimation and learning tasks."}

However, this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in redundant reasoning during the generation process, leading to high computational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking. Although numerous existing approaches aim to address the problem of overthinking, they often rely on external interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Self-Braking Tuning (SBT), which tackles overthinking from the perspective of allowing the model to regulate its own reasoning process, thus eliminating the reliance on external control mechanisms. We construct a set of overthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a systematic method to detect redundant reasoning. This method accurately identifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates training signals for learning self-regulation behaviors. Building on this foundation, we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive reasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that enables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an appropriate point.

However, this reasoning process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks.

To identify these interactions, most existing approaches require enumerating all possible combinations of features up to a given order, causing them to scale poorly with the number of inputs $n$. Recently, Kang et al. (2025) proposed SPEX, an information-theoretic approach that uses interaction sparsity to scale to $n \\approx 10^3$ features. SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires tens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large models. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often hierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order subsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy, we propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits gradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important interactions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets show that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over marginal attribution approaches while using $10\\times$ fewer inferences than SPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX efficiently identifies the most influential features, providing a scalable approximation of their Shapley values. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data attribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples that influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we uncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on a question-answering task."}

The optimization landscape of these functions is often highly complex and textured, even fractal-like, with many spurious local minima, ill-conditioned valleys, degenerate points, and saddle points. Complicating things further is the fact that these landscape characteristics are a function of the data, meaning that noise in the training data can propagate forward and give rise to unrepresentative small-scale geometry. This poses a difficulty for gradient-based optimization methods, which rely on local geometry to compute updates and are, therefore, vulnerable to being derailed by noisy data. In practice,this translates to a strong dependence of the optimization dynamics on the noise in the data, i.e., poor generalization performance. To remediate this problem, we propose a new optimization procedure: Rolling Ball Optimizer (RBO), that breaks this spatial locality by incorporating information from a larger region of the loss landscape in its updates. We achieve this by simulating the motion of a rigid sphere of finite radius rolling on the loss landscape, a straightforward generalization of Gradient Descent (GD) that simplifies into it in the infinitesimal limit. The radius serves as a hyperparameter that determines the scale at which RBO sees the loss landscape, allowing control over the granularity of its interaction therewith. We are motivated by the intuition that the large-scale geometry of the loss landscape is less data-specific than its fine-grained structure, and that it is easier to optimize. We support this intuition by proving that our algorithm has a smoothing effect on the loss function. Evaluation against SGD, SAM, and Entropy-SGD, on MNIST and CIFAR-10/100 demonstrates promising results in terms of convergence speed, training accuracy, and generalization performance."}

Specifically, our approach enables the model to progressively resolve uncertainty while capturing the structured dependencies among agents, providing a more accurate representation of how agents influence the state. Interestingly, this sequential revelation of agents' actions in a multi-agent system aligns with the reverse process in diffusion models--a class of powerful generative models known for their expressiveness and training stability compared to autoregressive or latent variable models.

A few steps of finetuning can revert their effects. We begin by showing that this is true even for an idealized form of unlearning: training to imitate a model that was never trained on unwanted information. This shows that training a model can drastically modify its input-output behavior while leaving its underlying capabilities intact. In light of this dynamic, we show our main result. Training a randomly initialized student on the outputs of an unlearned model transfers behaviors while leaving latent capabilities behind. In short, distillation robustifies unlearning. Based on this result, we propose Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an unlearned model into a noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting, UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability removal."}

LLM-based agents are increasingly used to emulate individual and group behavior, primarily through prompting and supervised fine-tuning. Yet current simulations remain grounded in a behaviorist \"demographics in, behavior out\" paradigm, focusing on surface-level plausibility. As a result, they often lack internal coherence, causal reasoning, and belief traceability, making them unreliable for modeling how people reason, deliberate, and respond to interventions.To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds (GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and intervention consistency.

While powerful, they often suffer from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve. Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce TAI3, an API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed benchmarks or adversarial inputs, TAI3 generates realistic tasks based on toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency, TAI3 maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs demonstrate that TAI3 effectively uncovers intent integrity violations, significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query efficiency. Moreover, TAI3 generalizes well to stronger target models using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across domains."}

To facilitate learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for optimizing the balance between performance and cost, opening a pathway toward enhancing performance-cost trade-offs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.

The approach mixes class-conditioned scores along reverse diffusion trajectories, yielding domain-specific data augmentation without external resources. We systematically study class-selection strategies and find that mixing classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space yields larger gains, providing up to 3% additional average improvement, compared to selection based on proximity. Interestingly, we observe that condition and embedding spaces are largely uncorrelated under standard alignment metrics, and the generator's condition space has a negligible effect on downstream performance. Across 8 public face recognition benchmarks, ScoreMix improves accuracy by up to 7 percentage points, without hyperparameter search, highlighting both robustness and practicality.

System-level defenses have recently shown promise by enforcing static or predefined policies, but they still face two key challenges: the ability to dynamically update security rules and the need for memory stream isolation. To address these challenges, we propose DRIFT, a Dynamic Rule-based Isolation Framework for Trustworthy agentic systems, which enforces both control- and data-level constraints. A Secure Planner first constructs a minimal function trajectory and a JSON-schema-style parameter checklist for each function node based on the user query. A Dynamic Validator then monitors deviations from the original plan, assessing whether changes comply with privilege limitations and the user's intent. Finally, an Injection Isolator detects and masks any instructions that may conflict with the user query from the memory stream to mitigate long-term risks. We empirically validate the effectiveness of DRIFT on the AgentDojo and ASB benchmark, demonstrating its strong security performance while maintaining high utility across diverse models, showcasing both its robustness and adaptability.

Typically, this term is either a KL divergence that matches marginal probabilities or a correlation-based loss that captures intra- and inter-class relationships. In every case, it acts as an additional term to cross-entropy. This term has its own weight, which must be carefully tuned. In this paper, we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting teacher logits as \"worth\" scores. We introduce \"Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD)\", a weighted list-wise ranking loss. In PLD, the teacher model transfers knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single \"teacher-optimal\" ranking. The true label is placed first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher confidence. This process yields a convex and translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes weighted cross-entropy.

To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration.

Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1) leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and efficient TD learning.

Seeking a practical solution, we look towards label smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for overconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing is sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However, settings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in particular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs).

Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution, we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of each layer dynamically changes across decoding steps. Building on this insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns precision to each layer based on input values. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off, outperforming prior approaches."}

Our results reveal a robust unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors. Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters ahead, without requiring task-specific training.

Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address this issue by splitting windows into blocks (sacrificing bidirectionality), but we find that this also leads to time-interval expansion problem, sacrificing the speed.

Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of discretization time steps, $\\exp(-\\sum_{t=1}^N\\Delta_t)$, we establish a connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, offering a well-founded explanation of its role in length extension.

We attribute this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality contexts while preserving critical information.

Many existing planners generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions, we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance, requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms.

While social learning enables the transmission of such innovations, the cognitive processes that generate innovations remain unclear. We propose that semantic knowledge-the associations linking concepts to their properties and functions-guides human innovation and drives cumulative culture. To test this, we combined an agent-based model, which examines how semantic knowledge shapes cultural evolutionary dynamics, with a large-scale behavioural experiment (N = 1,243) testing its role in human innovation. Semantic knowledge directed exploration toward meaningful solutions and interacted synergistically with social learning to amplify innovation and cultural evolution. Participants lacking access to semantic knowledge performed no better than chance, even when social information was available, and relied on shallow exploration strategies for innovation. Together, these findings indicate that semantic knowledge is a key cognitive process enabling human cumulative culture."}

Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models."}

However, traditional example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science, specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs."}

To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout, and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency.

Existing methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks. Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps.

Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving.

These complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents with reinforcement learning (RL).

However, few practical approaches achieve the gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration -- often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking. Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal oracle behavior more closely."}

Drawing from art historical discourse on the nature of abstraction, I argue that AI-generated images want specificity and concreteness because they are fundamentally abstract. Multimodal text-to-image models, which are the primary subject of this article, are based on the premise that text and image are interchangeable or exchangeable tokens and that there is a commensurability between them, at least as represented mathematically in data.

MolBridge constructs a joint graph that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling long-range atomic dependencies.

We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration (asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next, to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling).

Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).

While extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more reliable adaptive gating of CoT."}

Our results reveal a clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are acceptable.

However, SFT, being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data, particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce."}

We conduct extensive experiments involving eight representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias.

Methods: We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and mitigate misinformation.

Results: Human evaluation, with substantial inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 % contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians.

Block-sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity.

Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by scrambling is smaller than expected."}

However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs in HAR.

This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality, rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility, classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36% compared to traditional metrics.

Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data, visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness of its various capabilities."}

However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance, especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation: intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically, our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks."}

In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more generalizable semantic representations.

However, their application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks, with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock movement prediction."}

Specifically, after benign reasoning training on math or code domains, RLMs will use multiple strategies to circumvent their own safety guardrails. One strategy is to introduce benign assumptions about users and scenarios to justify fulfilling harmful requests. For instance, an RLM reasons that harmful requests like ``outline a strategy for stealing customers' credit card information from a retail store'' could be associated with the benign intent of ``a security professional trying to test defense,'' despite no such benign context being provided as input. We observe that many open-weight RLMs, including DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron, suffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the requests. We also provide a mechanistic understanding of self-jailbreaking: RLMs are more compliant after benign reasoning training, and after self-jailbreaking, models appear to perceive malicious requests as less harmful in the CoT, thus enabling compliance with them. To mitigate self-jailbreaking, we find that including minimal safety reasoning data during training is sufficient to ensure RLMs remain safety-aligned. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of self-jailbreaking behavior and offers a practical path forward for maintaining safety in increasingly capable RLMs."}

To systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts. This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs. Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs."}

To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data). These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue. To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing."}

In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples).

Rigorous evaluation of these agents is critical for progress.

To this end, these studies employed LLMs to generate preference trees via Tree-of-thoughts (ToT) and sample the paired preference responses required by the DPO algorithm. However, the DPO algorithm based on binary preference optimization is unable to learn multiple responses with varying degrees of preference/dispreference that provided by the preference trees, resulting in incomplete preference learning. In this work, we introduce Tree Preference Optimization (TPO), that does not sample paired preference responses from the preference tree; instead, it directly learns from the entire preference tree during the fine-tuning.

In addition, to further assist LLMs in identifying discriminative steps within long-chain reasoning and increase the relative reward margin in the preference list, TPO utilizes Adaptive Step Reward to adjust the reward values of each step in trajectory for performing fine-grained preference optimization.

After training, embeddings are precomputed and stored in off-accelerator memory; during inference, querying them has minimal impact on latency due to the low complexity of embedding lookups. $SCONE$ enables two new scaling strategies: increasing the number of n-gram embeddings and scaling the model used to learn them, both while maintaining fixed accelerator usage during inference (in terms of FLOPS and memory). We show that scaling both aspects enables a model with 1B accelerator-resident parameters to outperform a 1.9B-parameter baseline across diverse corpora, while using only about half the FLOPS and accelerator memory during inference."}

However, the rapid pace of their deployment has outpaced a comprehensive understanding of their internal mechanisms and a delineation of their capabilities and limitations. A desired attribute of an intelligent system is its ability to recognize the scope of its own knowledge. To investigate whether LLMs embody this characteristic, we develop a benchmark designed to challenge these models to enumerate all information they possess on specific topics. This benchmark evaluates whether the models recall excessive, insufficient, or the precise amount of information, thereby indicating their awareness of their own knowledge. Our findings reveal that all tested LLMs, given sufficient scale, demonstrate an understanding of how much they know about specific topics. While different architectures exhibit varying rates of this capability's emergence, the results suggest that awareness of knowledge may be a generalizable attribute of LLMs. Further research is needed to confirm this potential and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms."}

We segment the text by section titles and use zero-shot LLM prompting to implement section classification, question-answering (QA) augmentation, and weighted innovation scoring.

In this paper, we show first that BLEU, a basic string-matching metric, surprisingly matches strong reward models in agreement with human preferences on general instruction-following datasets. Based on this insight, we develop BLEUBERI, a method that first identifies challenging instructions and then applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using BLEU directly as the reward function. We demonstrate that BLEUBERI-trained models are competitive with models trained via reward model-guided RL across four challenging instruction-following benchmarks and three different base language models. A human evaluation further supports that the quality of BLEUBERI model outputs is on par with those from reward model-aligned models. Moreover, BLEUBERI models generate outputs that are more factually grounded than competing methods.

However, this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in redundant reasoning during the generation process, leading to high computational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking. Although numerous existing approaches aim to address the problem of overthinking, they often rely on external interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Self-Braking Tuning (SBT), which tackles overthinking from the perspective of allowing the model to regulate its own reasoning process, thus eliminating the reliance on external control mechanisms. We construct a set of overthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a systematic method to detect redundant reasoning. This method accurately identifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates training signals for learning self-regulation behaviors. Building on this foundation, we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive reasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that enables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an appropriate point.

Previous work shows that the answers generated by a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than existing frameworks.

Different from the work of proposing sequence modeling architecture to improve the efficiency of attention mechanism, this work focuses on the impact of sequence modeling architectures on base capabilities. Specifically, our concern is: How exactly do sequence modeling architectures affect the base capabilities of pre-trained language models? In this work, we first point out that the mixed domain pre-training setting commonly adopted in existing architecture design works fails to adequately reveal the differences in base capabilities among various architectures. To address this, we propose a limited domain pre-training setting with out-of-distribution testing, which successfully uncovers significant differences in base capabilities among architectures at an early stage. Next, we analyze the base capabilities of stateful sequence modeling architectures, and find that they exhibit significant degradation in base capabilities compared to the Transformer. Then, through a series of architecture component analysis, we summarize a key architecture design principle: A sequence modeling architecture need possess full-sequence arbitrary selection capability to avoid degradation in base capabilities. Finally, we empirically validate this principle using an extremely simple Top-1 element selection architecture and further generalize it to a more practical Top-1 chunk selection architecture. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed sequence modeling architecture design principle and suggest that our work can serve as a valuable reference for future architecture improvements and novel designs."}

By isolating each layer's gradients and measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task performance."}

These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a novel method for achieving context-adaptive tokenization in LLMs at inference time. Leveraging an online data compression algorithm (Lempel-Ziv-Welch), zip2zip dynamically expands its active vocabulary at inference time by continuously replacing fragmented token sequences with more compact hypertokens, which it can immediately output during generation. In doing so, the model refines its internal tokenization scheme to match the token distribution of the current context, reducing redundancy and improving representational efficiency. zip2zip consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression that incrementally merges co-occurring tokens into reusable hypertokens on the fly; (2) a dynamic embedding (and unembedding) layer that computes embeddings for newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a variant of autoregressive language modeling that pretrains the model to handle hypertokenized, compressed text sequences as inputs and outputs. We show that an existing LLM can be uptrained for zip2zip in 10 GPU-hours via parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting LLM performs test-time adaptation, learning to use hypertokens in unseen contexts and reducing input and output tokens by 15-40%."}

While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4), raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization without relying on external models at inference time. SEAL leverages adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are then used to distill anonymization and critique capabilities into SLMs through supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The resulting models learn both to anonymize text and to evaluate their outputs, enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement. Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy protection. These results highlight the effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework for training SLMs as efficient anonymizers."}

Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus (LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning, code generation and multi-hop question answering benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model."}

We attribute this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate model for CI value prediction during inference.

In this work, we focus on UQ for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic, token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution. By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance (using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty (avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised (sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a 13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead."}

This framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability.

A human preference can be visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet, because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc, training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT) demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline, achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the reliability of preference-aligned models."}

A key question is whether the system would learn to generalize from the axiom demonstrations to more complex scenarios. Our results, based on applying axiomatic training to learn the transitivity axiom and d-separation rule, indicate that such generalization is possible. To avoid data contamination issues, we start with a 67 million parameter transformer model and train it from scratch.

However, the learnability of these simulators from observational data has remained an open question. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that linear attention may be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. As a consequence, the problem of learning any linear transformer may be converted into the problem of learning an ordinary linear predictor in an expanded feature space, and any such predictor may be converted back into a multiheaded linear transformer. Moving to generalization, we show how to efficiently identify training datasets for which every empirical risk minimizer is equivalent (up to trivial symmetries) to the linear Transformer that generated the data, thereby guaranteeing the learned model will correctly generalize across all inputs. Finally, we provide examples of computations expressible via linear attention and therefore polynomial-time learnable, including associative memories, finite automata, and a class of Universal Turing Machine (UTMs) with polynomially bounded computation histories. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on three tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata.

We call a network untrainable when it overfits, underfits, or converges to poor results even when tuning their hyperparameters. For example, fully connected networks overfit on object recognition while deep convolutional networks without residual connections underfit. The traditional answer is to change the architecture to impose some inductive bias, although the nature of that bias is unknown. We introduce guidance, where a guide network steers a target network using a neural distance function. The target minimizes its task loss plus a layerwise representational similarity against the frozen guide. If the guide is trained, this transfers over the architectural prior and knowledge of the guide to the target. If the guide is untrained, this transfers over only part of the architectural prior of the guide. We show that guidance prevents FCN overfitting on ImageNet, narrows the vanilla RNN-Transformer gap, boosts plain CNNs toward ResNet accuracy, and aids Transformers on RNN-favored tasks. We further identify that guidance-driven initialization alone can mitigate FCN overfitting.

Therefore, testing LLM even after alignment efforts remains crucial for detecting any residual deviations with respect to ethical standards. We present EvoTox, an automated testing framework for LLMs' inclination to toxicity, providing a way to quantitatively assess how much LLMs can be pushed towards toxic responses even in the presence of alignment. The framework adopts an iterative evolution strategy that exploits the interplay between two LLMs, the System Under Test (SUT) and the Prompt Generator steering SUT responses toward higher toxicity. The toxicity level is assessed by an automated oracle based on an existing toxicity classifier. We conduct a quantitative and qualitative empirical evaluation using five state-of-the-art LLMs as evaluation subjects having increasing complexity (7-671B parameters). Our quantitative evaluation assesses the cost-effectiveness of four alternative versions of EvoTox against existing baseline methods, based on random search, curated datasets of toxic prompts, and adversarial attacks. Our qualitative assessment engages human evaluators to rate the fluency of the generated prompts and the perceived toxicity of the responses collected during the testing sessions. Results indicate that the effectiveness, in terms of detected toxicity level, is significantly higher than the selected baseline methods (effect size up to 1.0 against random search and up to 0.99 against adversarial attacks).

However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model."}

Furthermore, RLVR with only two examples even slightly exceeds these results (MATH500: 74.8%, average: 36.6%). Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples. In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-category generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the \"grokking\" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by incorporating entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. We also further discuss related observations about format correction, label robustness and prompt modification. These findings can inspire future work on RLVR efficiency and encourage a re-examination of recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR. All resources are open source atthis https URL."}

Benna", "title": "Language Models Are Capable of Metacognitive Monitoring and Control of Their Internal Activations", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes report the strategies they actually use to solve tasks, yet at other times seem unable to recognize those strategies that govern their behavior. This suggests a limited degree of metacognition - the capacity to monitor one's own cognitive processes for subsequent reporting and self-control. Metacognition enhances LLMs' capabilities in solving complex tasks but also raises safety concerns, as models may obfuscate their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight (e.g., safety detector). Given society's increased reliance on these models, it is critical that we understand their metacognitive abilities. To address this, we introduce a neuroscience-inspired neurofeedback paradigm that uses in-context learning to quantify metacognitive abilities of LLMs to report and control their activation patterns. We demonstrate that their abilities depend on several factors: the number of in-context examples provided, the semantic interpretability of the neural activation direction (to be reported/controlled), and the variance explained by that direction. These directions span a \"metacognitive space\" with dimensionality much lower than the model's neural space, suggesting LLMs can monitor only a small subset of their neural activations. Our paradigm provides empirical evidence to quantify metacognition in LLMs, with significant implications for AI safety (e.g., adversarial attack and defense)."}

However, this reasoning process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks. Our 7B model, \\model, achieves 84\\% on V* bench, 74\\% on TallyQA-Complex, and 84\\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy achieved by any open-source model to date.

To identify these interactions, most existing approaches require enumerating all possible combinations of features up to a given order, causing them to scale poorly with the number of inputs $n$. Recently, Kang et al. (2025) proposed SPEX, an information-theoretic approach that uses interaction sparsity to scale to $n \\approx 10^3$ features. SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires tens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large models. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often hierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order subsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy, we propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits gradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important interactions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets show that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over marginal attribution approaches while using $10\\times$ fewer inferences than SPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX efficiently identifies the most influential features, providing a scalable approximation of their Shapley values. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data attribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples that influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we uncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on a question-answering task."}

This fixed computation disregards query difficulty and document distribution, leading to inefficiencies. We propose AcuRank, an adaptive reranking framework that dynamically adjusts both the amount and target of computation based on uncertainty estimates over document relevance. Using a Bayesian TrueSkill model, we iteratively refine relevance estimates until reaching sufficient confidence levels, and our explicit modeling of ranking uncertainty enables principled control over reranking behavior and avoids unnecessary updates to confident predictions. Results on the TREC-DL and BEIR benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off and scales better with compute than fixed-computation baselines.

This paper introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs specialized agents (factor analyst and argument polisher) in an iterative refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant, rebuttal). We evaluate reflective multi-agent against single-agent, enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e, Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: \"arguable\", \"mismatched\", and \"non-arguable\". Results demonstrate that the reflective multi-agent approach excels at successful abstention by preventing generation when arguments cannot be grounded, improves hallucination accuracy by reducing fabricated and misattributed factors and enhances factor utilization recall by better using the provided case facts.

However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism inspired by experience replay in traditional RL. This technique reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates. Experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 23% to 62% while reaching the same level of performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human intervention. Moreover, to overcome static policies and accommodate changing task difficulty, we incorporate an online learning mechanism which uses human feedback. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and MMLU) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results demonstrate that our cascaded strategy outperforms single-model baselines in most cases, achieving higher accuracy while reducing costs and providing a principled approach to handling abstentions."}

To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages."}

SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization.

Several BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability, visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future updates. Code available at [github(.)com/daphne12345/FITS](this https URL)."}

We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations.

The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful, instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate, instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BioCAP (i.e., BioCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models."}

These adapters are typically trained to capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training, confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what should NOT be learned."}

Convolutional neural networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges. To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection, skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse medical imaging scenarios."}

Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers, a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference, guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant discriminative point trackers."}

Our method is referred to as VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture conditions, without the need of annotations.

Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of structural damage levels.

Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height, and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes. Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes, and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement, and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2% accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points."}

In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the subsequent fine-tuning.

Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence (VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely spatial skills.

As a complementary channel to text, SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial capability from language priors.

Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval, improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while significantly reducing inference cost.

However, existing methods typically rely on a single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TokenCLIP."}

KBE first analyzes the original static benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version.

However, their widespread adoption has been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts; (2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4) divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5) curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges, we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability with self-consistency.

By allowing TSSR to \"see\" all mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1) Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the realism and fidelity of the generated meshes.

Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.

Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA) demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with concepts.

On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment, IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and generalizable sCT synthesis models."}

Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream transmission limitations.

To address this, we introduce a joint end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.

The fusion is currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First, we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing LUT-realizable CNN methods."}

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection."}

Using aerial imagery from Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping (HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii) faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond \"black-box\" predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation monitoring."}

This pilot study used eye tracking to conduct a preliminary experiment to quantify which aspects of visual search were affected. Materials and Methods: We sampled 180 chest radiographs from the VinDR-CXR dataset: 120 with solitary pulmonary nodules or masses and 60 without. The BBs were configured to yield an overall display sensitivity and specificity of 80%. Three radiologists (with 11, 5, and 1 years of experience, respectively) interpreted each case twice - once with BBs visible and once without - after a washout of >= 2 weeks. Eye movements were recorded using an EyeTech VT3 Mini. Metrics included interpretation time, time to first fixation on the lesion, lesion dwell time, total gaze-path length, and lung-field coverage ratio. Outcomes were modeled using a linear mixed model, with reading condition as a fixed effect and case and reader as random intercepts. The primary analysis was restricted to true positives (n=96). Results: Concurrent BB display prolonged interpretation time by 4.9 s (p<0.001) and increased lesion dwell time by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Total gaze-path length increased by 2,076 pixels (p<0.001), and lung-field coverage ratio increased by 10.5% (p<0.001). Time to first fixation on the lesion was reduced by 1.3 s (p<0.001).

Beyond its memory efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning (CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge, particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and memory-efficient solution for on-device CL."}

Recent developments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor segmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy computational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible for researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The ensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and accuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was trained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The proposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor segmentation, even under limited hardware constraints.

This expense stems primarily from the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency. Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (\\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets, demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\\times$ in long-context prefilling, confirming its practical viability.

However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent performance improvements across various architectures.

Recent studies have shown the efficacy of using deep learning to directly predict the input function, surpassing established methods such as the image-derived input function (IDIF). In this work, we trained a physics-informed deep learning-based input function prediction model (PIDLIF) to estimate the AIF directly from the PET images, incorporating a kinetic modeling loss during training. The proposed method uses a two-tissue compartment model over two regions, the myocardium and brain of the mice, and is trained on a dataset of 70 [${}^{18}$F]FDG dPET images of mice accompanied by the measured AIF during imaging. The proposed method had comparable performance to the network without a physics-informed loss, and when sudden movement causing blurring in the images was simulated, the PIDLIF model maintained high performance in severe cases of image degradation. The proposed physics-informed method exhibits an improved robustness that is promoted by physically constraining the problem, enforcing consistency for out-of-distribution samples. In conclusion, the PIDLIF model offers insight into the effects of leveraging physiological distribution mechanics in mice to guide a deep learning-based AIF prediction network in images with severe degradation as a result of blurring due to movement during imaging."}

Such divergent approaches result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias, a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global style and objects.

This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos.

Most existing approaches treat RGB and infrared modalities equally. They typically adopt two symmetrical backbones for multimodal feature extraction, which ignore the substantial differences between modalities and bring great difficulty for the reduction of the computational cost as well as effective crossmodal fusion. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient framework named Wavelet-context Cooperative Network (WCCNet) that is able to differentially extract complementary features of different spectra with lower computational complexity, and further fuse these diverse features based on their spatially relevant crossmodal semantics. In particular, WCCNet simultaneously explore wavelet context and RGB textures within a cooperative dual-stream backbone, which is composed of adaptive discrete wavelet transform (ADWT) layers and heavyweight neural layers. The ADWT layers extract frequency components for infrared modality, while neural layers handle RGB modality features. Since ADWT layers are lightweight and extract complementary features, this cooperative structure not only significantly reduces the computational complexity, but also facilitates the subsequent crossmodal fusion. To further fuse these infrared and RGB features with significant semantic differences, we elaborately design the crossmodal rearranging fusion module (CMRF), which can mitigate spatial misalignment and merge semantically complementary features in spatially-related local regions to amplify the crossmodal reciprocal information.

In this study, we introduce CircleSnake, a simple end-to-end segmentation approach that utilizes circle contour deformation for segmenting ball-shaped medical objects at the instance level. The innovation of CircleSnake lies in these three areas: (1) It substitutes the complex bounding box-to-octagon contour transformation with a more consistent and rotation-invariant bounding circle-to-circle contour adaptation. This adaptation specifically targets ball-shaped medical objects. (2) The circle representation employed in CircleSnake significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to two, compared to eight in the octagon representation. This reduction enhances both the robustness of the segmentation performance and the rotational consistency of the method. (3) CircleSnake is the first end-to-end deep instance segmentation pipeline to incorporate circle representation, encompassing consistent circle detection, circle contour proposal, and circular convolution in a unified framework. This integration is achieved through the novel application of circular graph convolution within the context of circle detection and instance segmentation. In practical applications, such as the detection of glomeruli, nuclei, and eosinophils in pathological images, CircleSnake has demonstrated superior performance and greater rotation invariance when compared to benchmarks.

As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space. To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE. Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model. To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples.

We analyze these cue influences at multiple levels by decomposing datasets into cue-specific versions. Addressing semantic segmentation, we learn the given task from these reduced cue datasets, creating cue experts. Early fusion of cues is performed by constructing appropriate datasets. This is complemented by a late fusion of experts which allows us to study cue influence location-dependent on pixel level. Experiments on Cityscapes, PASCAL Context, and a synthetic CARLA dataset show that while no single cue dominates, the shape + color expert predominantly improves the prediction of small objects and border pixels.

We then introduce an optimization-based method called Segment Score Distillation (SSD) to refine the entire long motion sequence. SSD is designed to utilize an existing motion prior, which is trained only on short clips, in a training-free manner. Specifically, SSD iteratively refines overlapping short segments sampled from the coarsely extended long motion sequence, progressively aligning them with the pre-trained motion diffusion prior. This process ensures local coherence within each segment, while the refined transitions between segments maintain global consistency across the entire sequence.

Specifically, to address the noisy feedback problem that obfuscates the exploration of scene-related PAEs, we introduce the residual-guided adversarial pattern exploration technique. Residual-guided training, which relaxes the attack training with a reconstruction task, is proposed to enrich the feedback information, thereby achieving a more comprehensive exploration of PAEs. To address the alignment problem between the trained generator and the real-world scenario, we introduce the distribution-matched attack scenario alignment, consisting of the conditional-uncertainty-aligned data module and the skewness-aligned objective re-weighting module. The former aligns the training environment with the incomplete observation of the real-world attacker. The latter facilitates consistent stealth control across different attack targets with the skewness controller. Extensive digital and physical evaluations demonstrate the superior attack performance of DynamicPAE, attaining a 2.07 $\\times$ boost (58.8% average AP drop under attack) on representative object detectors (e.g., DETR) over state-of-the-art static PAE generating methods. Overall, our work opens the door to end-to-end modeling of dynamic PAEs."}

We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to generate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would significantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice that existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple tokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the conditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for few-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which uses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution to the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network to distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the training data of the original AR model, making it more practical. We evaluate DD on state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on ImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step generation (6.3$\\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19 to 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an 217.8$\\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35. In both cases, baseline methods completely fail with FID>100. DD also excels on text-to-image generation, reducing the generation from 256 steps to 2 for LlamaGen with minimal FID increase from 25.70 to 28.95. As the first work to demonstrate the possibility of one-step generation for image AR models, DD challenges the prevailing notion that AR models are inherently slow, and opens up new opportunities for efficient AR generation.

Numerous approaches are proposed to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples, including advanced optimization, data augmentation, and model modifications. However, these methods still show limited transferability, particularly in cross-architecture scenarios, such as from CNN to ViT. To achieve high transferability, we propose a technique termed Spatial Adversarial Alignment (SAA), which employs an alignment loss and leverages a witness model to fine-tune the surrogate model. Specifically, SAA consists of two key parts: spatial-aware alignment and adversarial-aware alignment. First, we minimize the divergences of features between the two models in both global and local regions, facilitating spatial alignment. Second, we introduce a self-adversarial strategy that leverages adversarial examples to impose further constraints, aligning features from an adversarial perspective. Through this alignment, the surrogate model is trained to concentrate on the common features extracted by the witness model. This facilitates adversarial attacks on these shared features, thereby yielding perturbations that exhibit enhanced transferability. Extensive experiments on various architectures on ImageNet show that aligned surrogate models based on SAA can provide higher transferable adversarial examples, especially in cross-architecture attacks."}

However, athletes are often in rapid movement and the corresponding visual appearance variances are subtle, making it challenging to capture fine-grained pose differences and leading to poor estimation performance. Furthermore, most common AQA tasks, such as diving in sports, are usually divided into multiple sub-actions, each of which contains different durations. However, existing methods focus on segmenting the video into fixed frames, which disrupts the temporal continuity of sub-actions resulting in unavoidable prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel action quality assessment method through hierarchically pose-guided multi-stage contrastive regression. Firstly, we introduce a multi-scale dynamic visual-skeleton encoder to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal visual and skeletal features. Then, a procedure segmentation network is introduced to separate different sub-actions and obtain segmented features. Afterwards, the segmented visual and skeletal features are both fed into a multi-modal fusion module as physics structural priors, to guide the model in learning refined activity similarities and variances. Finally, a multi-stage contrastive learning regression approach is employed to learn discriminative representations and output prediction results.

While autoregressive models are typically used to generate sequential data, RigAnything extends its application to effectively learn and represent skeletons, which are inherently tree structures. To achieve this, we organize the joints in a breadth-first search (BFS) order, enabling the skeleton to be defined as a sequence of 3D locations and the parent index. Furthermore, our model improves the accuracy of position prediction by leveraging diffusion modeling, ensuring precise and consistent placement of joints within the hierarchy.

Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization.

However, for complex multimodal tasks, such annotations are prohibitively expensive or impractical to obtain. In this paper, we propose an iterative tool usage exploration method for multimodal agents without any pre-collected data, namely SPORT, via step-wise preference optimization to refine the trajectories of tool usage. Our method enables multimodal agents to autonomously discover effective tool usage strategies through self-exploration and optimization, eliminating the bottleneck of human annotation. SPORT has four iterative components: task synthesis, step sampling, step verification, and preference tuning. We first synthesize multimodal tasks using language models. Then, we introduce a novel trajectory exploration scheme, where step sampling and step verification are executed alternately to solve synthesized tasks. In step sampling, the agent tries different tools and obtains corresponding results. In step verification, we employ a verifier to provide AI feedback to construct step-wise preference data. The data is subsequently used to update the controller for tool usage through preference tuning, producing a SPORT agent. By interacting with real environments, the SPORT agent gradually evolves into a more refined and capable system.

We carefully examine the influence of these register tokens on the relationship between global and local image features, showing that while register tokens yield cleaner attention maps, these maps do not accurately reflect the integration of local image information in large models. Instead, global information is dominated by information extracted from register tokens, leading to a disconnect between local and global features.

Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks. Our 7B model, \\model, achieves 84\\% on V* bench, 74\\% on TallyQA-Complex, and 84\\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework."}

A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings.

Yet, their performance still lags behind that of artificial neural networks, often assumed to result from information loss caused by sparse and binary activations. In this work, we challenge this long-standing assumption and reveal a previously overlooked frequency bias: spiking neurons inherently suppress high-frequency components and preferentially propagate low-frequency information. This frequency-domain imbalance, we argue, is the root cause of degraded feature representation in SNNs. Empirically, on Spiking Transformers, adopting Avg-Pooling (low-pass) for token mixing lowers performance to 76.73% on Cifar-100, whereas replacing it with Max-Pool (high-pass) pushes the top-1 accuracy to 79.12%. Accordingly, we introduce Max-Former that restores high-frequency signals through two frequency-enhancing operators: (1) extra Max-Pool in patch embedding, and (2) Depth-Wise Convolution in place of self-attention. Notably, Max-Former attains 82.39% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet using only 63.99M parameters, surpassing Spikformer (74.81%, 66.34M) by +7.58%. Extending our insight beyond transformers, our Max-ResNet-18 achieves state-of-the-art performance on convolution-based benchmarks: 97.17% on CIFAR-10 and 83.06% on CIFAR-100.

However, most existing approaches tackle these tasks in isolation, limiting progress toward unified, referentially grounded video interaction. We identify a key bottleneck in the lack of high-quality, unified video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating referentially grounded video chat. To address these challenges, we contribute in three core aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce SAMA-239K, a large-scale dataset comprising 15K videos specifically curated to enable joint learning of video referring understanding, grounding, and multi-turn video chat. Second, we propose the SAMA model, which incorporates a versatile spatio-temporal context aggregator and a Segment Anything Model to jointly enhance fine-grained video comprehension and precise grounding capabilities.

Causal2Needles evaluates these abilities using noncausal one-needle, causal one-needle, and causal two-needle questions. The most complex question type, causal two-needle questions, require extracting information from both the cause and effect events from a long video and the associated narration text.

These prompts are matched with a total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation. The dataset and evaluation codes will be available atthis https URL."}

To address this, we present Video-RTS, a new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time scaling (TTS) strategy. Building on observations about the data scaling, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS surpasses existing video reasoning models by 2.4% in accuracy using only 3.6% training samples. Specifically, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2% improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning benchmark.

Recently developed foundational models for 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction (DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to handle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical aerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps, stereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can accelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite tests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric aerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of the UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results show these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very sparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with completeness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher computational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose estimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and large sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric complexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully replace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches, especially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios."}

Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets.

While traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions.

Despite their success, conventional skip connections exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated into existing U-like network structures.

For neuromorphic vision (e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization.

Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities (2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class, inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial, biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented 99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and 97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design, computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection applications."}

Existing methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.

However, in real-world applications, differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2) accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model, generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\\% reduction in both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents.

The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful, instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate, instance-based descriptive captions.

We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory.

However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models, which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate generative steps.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) serves as a primary tool for mapping these networks by correlating blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across different brain regions, defined as regions of interest (ROIs). Constructing these brain networks involves using atlases to parcellate the brain into ROIs based on various hypotheses of brain division. However, there is no standard atlas for brain network classification, leading to limitations in detecting abnormalities in disorders. Some recent methods have proposed utilizing multiple atlases, but they neglect consistency across atlases and lack ROI-level information exchange. To tackle these limitations, we propose an Atlas-Integrated Distillation and Fusion network (AIDFusion) to improve brain network classification using fMRI data. AIDFusion addresses the challenge of utilizing multiple atlases by employing a disentangle Transformer to filter out inconsistent atlas-specific information and distill distinguishable connections across atlases. It also incorporates subject- and population-level consistency constraints to enhance cross-atlas consistency.

We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same number of parameters. We also find limited settings--namely fitting binary signals such as shape contours--where INRs outperform grids, to guide future development and use of INRs towards the most advantageous applications."}

In logit-based knowledge distillation, it has become the de facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically, this term is either a KL divergence that matches marginal probabilities or a correlation-based loss that captures intra- and inter-class relationships. In every case, it acts as an additional term to cross-entropy. This term has its own weight, which must be carefully tuned. In this paper, we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting teacher logits as \"worth\" scores. We introduce \"Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD)\", a weighted list-wise ranking loss. In PLD, the teacher model transfers knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single \"teacher-optimal\" ranking. The true label is placed first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher confidence. This process yields a convex and translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes weighted cross-entropy. Empirically, across CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and MS-COCO, PLD achieves consistent gains across diverse architectures and distillation objectives, including divergence-based, correlation-based, and feature-based methods, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous teacher-student pairs."}

However, these approaches often rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods."}

Accurate kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures, precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence, extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation. Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations."}

Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while drastically reducing computational overhead."}

To address these challenges, we introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning, domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots\", where performance peaks during test-time scaling.

Conventional approaches often force weak modalities to align with dominant ones in \"Learning to be (the same)\" (Positive Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm: \"Learning Not to be\" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities' target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance mechanism tailored for negative learning.

In this paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for the test data.

We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning dataset-specific patterns.

Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate (MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection. However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based on more comprehensive evidence.

By encoding fields as continuous functions within the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10 cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is available atthis https URL."}

Cooper,Yejin Choi", "title": "L^2M^3OF: A Large Language Multimodal Model for Metal-Organic Frameworks", "abstract": "Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage. Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly. L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials discovery."}

In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical quantization pipeline.

Despite their promising performance, they suffer from slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required. Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token position. Based on this, we propose a novel \\emph{conditional score distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256. Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\\times$ training speed-up simultaneously.

Beyond its memory efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning (CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge, particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and memory-efficient solution for on-device CL."}

While the sample complexity of online SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule -- and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent. However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s) and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an \"information exponent regime\" with small learning rate to a \"generative exponent regime\" with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency."}

In this work, we demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime.

Few-shot Molecular property prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph, yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction."}

As environments grow more realistic, belief distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and downstream decision quality."}

We address this problem by proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete Ising states while preserving physical constraints.We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable physical processes."}

To address this, we propose Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate over-aggregating.

However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent performance improvements across various architectures.

Existing data selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems."}

In this work, we challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations are possible or provably hard."}

In this work, we introduce a neighbouring datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it with rigorous proofs.Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation techniques."}

These conventional metrics often fail to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret, which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards, aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness axioms.To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the $p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all $p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret bounds."}

We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g., moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions, explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to its reliance on $\\beta_2 \\to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.

To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data). These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue. To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing."}

To achieve efficient decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization, has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R) in OTCIL.

Such divergent approaches result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias, a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even both, without modifying the objectives or architectures.

Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global competition.

In contrast, self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it highly flexible and broadly applicable.

To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in future large decision models."}

To address this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.

For this reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item. In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products.

This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\\% and traditional optimization approaches by 24--82\\% in terms of solution quality (total collected information value).

This makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2) retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new probes after training.First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit - simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy. Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is feasible."}

To address this limitation, pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy, significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD), which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency.

We formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions, before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions."}

To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices (UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning, computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game (MADDPG-COCG) algorithm.

Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the classical bias-variance trade-off.

This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training. Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps with training datasets by downsampling.

Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably, CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance."}

In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches."}

Since traditional classification and regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties."}

BACE aggregates many micro-contacts within each anatomical region via per-region temporal encoders, applies a learnable adjacency specific to each behavioral phase, and is trained on a forecasting objective.

Despite extensive recent advances in identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically, this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background, and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated (intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical testbed for CRL."}

Our key insight extends the classical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise perturbations, going beyond the Gaussian assumption and enabling structured noise distributions. This formulation allows flexible use of randomized noise distributions that naturally account for sensor artifacts, quantization effects, and data distribution smoothing, while remaining compatible with standard diffusion training. Treating the diffusion process as a Gaussian channel, we further express the mismatched entropy between data and model, showing that the proposed objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood (NLL).

A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly alarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image, without requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial and vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass industry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and Microsoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are far easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering the barrier to large-scale attacks.

As AI systems become more ubiquitous, ensuring the transparency and correctness of AI-driven decisions is crucial, especially when they have direct consequences on privacy, security, or fairness. Verifiable AI, powered by Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML), offers a robust solution to these challenges. zkML enables the verification of AI model inferences without exposing sensitive data, providing an essential layer of trust and privacy. However, traditional zkML systems typically require deep cryptographic expertise, placing them beyond the reach of most ML engineers. In this paper, we introduce JSTprove, a specialized zkML toolkit, built on Polyhedra Network's Expander backend, to enable AI developers and ML engineers to generate and verify proofs of AI inference. JSTprove provides an end-to-end verifiable AI inference pipeline that hides cryptographic complexity behind a simple command-line interface while exposing auditable artifacts for reproducibility. We present the design, innovations, and real-world use cases of JSTprove as well as our blueprints and tooling to encourage community review and extension.

Our pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study (25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth.

In this work, we propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet).

Accurate estimation of how much GPU memory a job will require is fundamental to enabling advanced scheduling and GPU sharing, which helps prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors and resource underutilization. However, existing estimation methods have limitations. Approaches relying on static analysis or historical data with machine learning often fail to accurately capture runtime dynamics. Furthermore, direct GPU analysis consumes scarce resources, and some techniques require intrusive code modifications. Thus, the key challenge lies in precisely estimating dynamic memory requirements, including memory allocator nuances, without consuming GPU resources and non-intrusive code changes. To address this challenge, we propose xMem, a novel framework that leverages CPU-only dynamic analysis to accurately estimate peak GPU memory requirements a priori. We conducted a thorough evaluation of xMem against state-of-the-art solutions using workloads from 25 different models, including architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers. The analysis of 5209 runs, which includes ANOVA and Monte Carlo results, highlights xMem's benefits: it decreases the median relative error by 91% and significantly reduces the probability of estimation failure as safe OOM thresholds by 75%, meaning that the estimated value can often be used directly without causing OOM. Ultimately, these improvements lead to a 368% increase in memory conservation potential over current solutions."}

Our results reveal a clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are acceptable.

To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods.

This paper introduces TURBOTEST, a systematic framework for speed test termination that sits atop existing platforms. The key idea is to decouple throughput prediction (Stage 1) from test termination (Stage 2): Stage 1 trains a regressor to estimate final throughput from partial measurements, while Stage 2 trains a classifier to decide when sufficient evidence has accumulated to stop. Leveraging richer transport-level features (RTT, retransmissions, congestion window) alongside throughput, TURBOTEST exposes a single tunable parameter for accuracy tolerance and includes a fallback mechanism for high-variability cases. Evaluation on 173,000 M-Lab NDT speed tests (2024-2025) shows that TURBOTEST achieves nearly 2-4x higher data savings than an approach based on BBR signals while reducing median error.

In this work, we go beyond diagnostics and introduce a general regularization framework to enforce multivariate calibration during training for arbitrary pre-rank functions. This framework encompasses existing approaches such as highest density region calibration and copula calibration. Our method enforces calibration by penalizing deviations of the projected probability integral transforms (PITs) from the uniform distribution, and can be added as a regularization term to the loss function of any probabilistic predictor. Specifically, we propose a regularization loss that jointly enforces both marginal and multivariate pre-rank calibration. We also introduce a new PCA-based pre-rank that captures calibration along directions of maximal variance in the predictive distribution, while also enabling dimensionality reduction. Across 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that unregularized models are consistently miscalibrated, and that our methods significantly improve calibration across all pre-rank functions without sacrificing predictive accuracy."}

To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training. First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity.

Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios, limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments.

Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability.This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified).

This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application.

However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants, each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers, each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers. Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant. Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation, we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES over prior methods."}

Recent findings reveal that, even when the performance remains stable, the underlying neural representations can change gradually over time, a phenomenon known as representational drift. Studying the different sources of data and noise that may contribute to drift is essential for understanding lifelong learning in neural systems. However, a systematic study of drift across architectures and learning rules, and the connection to task, are missing. Here, in an online learning setup, we characterize drift as a function of data distribution, and specifically show that the learning noise induced by task-irrelevant stimuli, which the agent learns to ignore in a given context, can create long-term drift in the representation of task-relevant stimuli. Using theory and simulations, we demonstrate this phenomenon both in Hebbian-based learning -- Oja's rule and Similarity Matching -- and in stochastic gradient descent applied to autoencoders and a supervised two-layer network. We consistently observe that the drift rate increases with the variance and the dimension of the data in the task-irrelevant subspace. We further show that this yields different qualitative predictions for the geometry and dimension-dependency of drift than those arising from Gaussian synaptic noise. Overall, our study links the structure of stimuli, task, and learning rule to representational drift and could pave the way for using drift as a signal for uncovering underlying computation in the brain."}

Each member of this family is a weighted product of experts (PoE), and each weighted expert in the product is proportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. These products of experts can model distributions with skew, heavy tails, and multiple modes, but to use them for BBVI, we must be able to sample from their densities. We show how to do this by reformulating these products of experts as latent variable models with auxiliary Dirichlet random variables. These Dirichlet variables emerge from a Feynman identity, originally developed for loop integrals in quantum field theory, that expresses the product of multiple fractions (or in our case, $t$-distributions) as an integral over the simplex. We leverage this simplicial latent space to draw weighted samples from these products of experts -- samples which BBVI then uses to find the PoE that best approximates a target density. Given a collection of experts, we derive an iterative procedure to optimize the exponents that determine their geometric weighting in the PoE. At each iteration, this procedure minimizes a regularized Fisher divergence to match the scores of the variational and target densities at a batch of samples drawn from the current approximation. This minimization reduces to a convex quadratic program, and we prove under general conditions that these updates converge exponentially fast to a near-optimal weighting of experts.

Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy).In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Roessler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics."}

Yet, all of them were developed based on one fundamental concept, the numerical data fitting. Thus, the models developed have long been known to be problem-specific and lacking application generalizability. Practitioners expect a TSF foundation model that serves TSF tasks in different applications. The central question is then how to develop such a TSF foundation model. This paper offers one pioneering study in the TSF foundation model development method and proposes a vision intelligence-powered framework, ViTime, for the first time. ViTime fundamentally shifts TSF from numerical fitting to operations based on a binary image-based time series metric space and naturally supports both point and probabilistic forecasting. We also provide rigorous theoretical analyses of ViTime, including quantization-induced system error bounds and principled strategies for optimal parameter selection. Furthermore, we propose RealTS, an innovative synthesis algorithm generating diverse and realistic training samples, effectively enriching the training data and significantly enhancing model generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViTime's state-of-the-art performance. In zero-shot scenarios, ViTime outperforms TimesFM by 9-15\\%. With just 10\\% fine-tuning data, ViTime surpasses both leading foundation models and fully-supervised benchmarks, a gap that widens with 100\\% fine-tuning.

Since active interventions are costly, we study to what extent a system can learn causal reasoning from symbolic demonstrations of causal axioms. Specifically, we present an axiomatic training method where the system learns from multiple demonstrations of a causal axiom (or rule), rather than incorporating the axiom as an inductive bias or inferring it from data values. A key question is whether the system would learn to generalize from the axiom demonstrations to more complex scenarios. Our results, based on applying axiomatic training to learn the transitivity axiom and d-separation rule, indicate that such generalization is possible. To avoid data contamination issues, we start with a 67 million parameter transformer model and train it from scratch.

In this work, we establish global optimality guarantees of PG methods for RLGU in which the objective is a general concave utility function of the state-action occupancy measure. In the tabular setting, we provide global optimality results using a new proof technique building on recent theoretical developments on the convergence of PG methods for standard RL using gradient domination.

However, the learnability of these simulators from observational data has remained an open question. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that linear attention may be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. As a consequence, the problem of learning any linear transformer may be converted into the problem of learning an ordinary linear predictor in an expanded feature space, and any such predictor may be converted back into a multiheaded linear transformer. Moving to generalization, we show how to efficiently identify training datasets for which every empirical risk minimizer is equivalent (up to trivial symmetries) to the linear Transformer that generated the data, thereby guaranteeing the learned model will correctly generalize across all inputs. Finally, we provide examples of computations expressible via linear attention and therefore polynomial-time learnable, including associative memories, finite automata, and a class of Universal Turing Machine (UTMs) with polynomially bounded computation histories. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on three tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata.

This reveals that conventional rotation-invariant assumptions are insufficient to capture Adam's advantages theoretically. To better understand the rotation-dependent properties that benefit Adam, we also identify structured rotations that preserve or even enhance its empirical performance. We then examine the rotation-dependent assumptions in the literature and find that they fall short in explaining Adam's behaviour across various rotation types. In contrast, we verify the orthogonality of the update as a promising indicator of Adam's basis sensitivity, suggesting it may be the key quantity for developing rotation-dependent theoretical frameworks that better explain its empirical success."}

We call a network untrainable when it overfits, underfits, or converges to poor results even when tuning their hyperparameters. For example, fully connected networks overfit on object recognition while deep convolutional networks without residual connections underfit. The traditional answer is to change the architecture to impose some inductive bias, although the nature of that bias is unknown. We introduce guidance, where a guide network steers a target network using a neural distance function. The target minimizes its task loss plus a layerwise representational similarity against the frozen guide. If the guide is trained, this transfers over the architectural prior and knowledge of the guide to the target. If the guide is untrained, this transfers over only part of the architectural prior of the guide. We show that guidance prevents FCN overfitting on ImageNet, narrows the vanilla RNN-Transformer gap, boosts plain CNNs toward ResNet accuracy, and aids Transformers on RNN-favored tasks. We further identify that guidance-driven initialization alone can mitigate FCN overfitting. Our method provides a mathematical tool to investigate priors and architectures, and in the long term, could automate architecture design."}

While numerous LoRA variants have been proposed to improve performance by addressing one of these aspects, they often compromise usability or computational efficiency. In this paper, we analyze and identify the core limitations of existing approaches and propose a novel framework--GoRA (Gradient-driven Adaptive Low Rank Adaptation)--that simultaneously adapts both the rank and initialization strategy within a unified framework. GoRA leverages gradient information during training to dynamically assign optimal ranks and initialize low-rank adapter weights in an adaptive manner. To our knowledge, GoRA is the first method that not only addresses the limitations of prior approaches--which often focus on either rank selection or initialization in isolation--but also unifies both aspects within a single framework, enabling more effective and efficient adaptation. Extensive experiments across various architectures and modalities show that GoRA consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based methods while preserving the efficiency of vanilla LoRA. For example, when fine-tuning Llama3.1-8B-Base for mathematical reasoning, GoRA achieves a 5.13-point improvement over standard LoRA and even outperforms full fine-tuning by 2.05 points under high-rank settings.

In this work, we show that defences of fine-tuning APIs that seek to detect individual harmful training or inference samples ('pointwise' detection) are fundamentally limited in their ability to prevent fine-tuning attacks. We construct 'pointwise-undetectable' attacks that repurpose entropy in benign model outputs (e.g. semantic or syntactic variations) to covertly transmit dangerous knowledge. Our attacks are composed solely of unsuspicious benign samples that can be collected from the model before fine-tuning, meaning training and inference samples are all individually benign and low-perplexity. We test our attacks against the OpenAI fine-tuning API, finding they succeed in eliciting answers to harmful multiple-choice questions, and that they evade an enhanced monitoring system we design that successfully detects other fine-tuning attacks. We encourage the community to develop defences that tackle the fundamental limitations we uncover in pointwise fine-tuning API defences."}

While FL enhances privacy by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data, trained models still retain the influence of training data. Federated Unlearning (FU) methods recently proposed often rely on impractical assumptions for real-world FL deployments, such as storing client update histories or requiring access to a publicly available dataset. To address these constraints, this paper introduces a novel method that leverages negated Pseudo-gradients Updates for Federated Unlearning (PUF). Our approach only uses standard client model updates, which are employed during regular FL rounds, and interprets them as pseudo-gradients. When a client needs to be forgotten, we apply the negation of their pseudo-gradients, appropriately scaled, to the global model.

Unlike conventional PINNs that rely on analytical PDEs, our approach leverages FEM residuals to guide the learning of the ROM approximation manifold. Key contributions include: (1) a parameter-agnostic, discrete residual loss applicable to non-linear problems, (2) an architectural modification to PROM-ANN improving accuracy for fast-decaying singular values, and (3) an empirical study on the proposed physics informed training process for ROMs.The method is demonstrated on a non-linear hyperelasticity problem, simulating a rubber cantilever under multi-axial loads. The main accomplishment in regards to the proposed residual-based loss is its applicability on non-linear problems by interfacing with FEM software while maintaining reasonable training times. The modified PROM-ANN outperforms POD by orders of magnitude in snapshot reconstruction accuracy, while the original formulation is not able to learn a proper mapping for this use-case. Finally, the application of physics informed training in ANN-PROM modestly narrows the gap between data reconstruction and ROM accuracy, however it highlights the untapped potential of the proposed residual-driven optimization for future ROM development.

In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-category generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the \"grokking\" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by incorporating entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training.

Despite its broad applicability across econometrics, biostatistics, and machine learning, rigorous parameter-free guarantees for the soundness of the m-out-of-n bootstrap when estimating sample quantiles have remained elusive.This paper establishes such guarantees by analyzing the estimator of sample quantiles obtained from m-out-of-n resampling of a dataset of size n. We first prove a central limit theorem for a fully data-driven version of the estimator that holds under a mild moment condition and involves no unknown nuisance parameters.

It disrupts the tightly fused memory-compute pipeline that underlies the speed of accelerators like FlashAttention, thereby stripping away most of their performance gains and leaving biased attention computationally expensive. Surprisingly, despite its common usage, targeted efficiency optimization for attention with bias remains absent, which seriously hinders its application in complex tasks.

These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization.

Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters (0.1%) and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field."}

The ENF integration ensures equivariant mapping from these latent representations to the solution field, delivering three key benefits: enhanced representation efficiency through weight-sharing, robust geometric grounding, and solution steerability. This steerability allows transformations applied to the latent point cloud to induce predictable, geometrically meaningful modifications in the resulting Eikonal solution.

We address this gap by first introducing a novel notion of latent calibration, which assesses probabilistic calibration in the latent space of a conditional normalizing flow. Second, we propose latent recalibration (LR), a novel post-hoc model recalibration method that learns a transformation of the latent space with finite-sample bounds on latent calibration.

A common mitigation strategy is to update the model more strongly on examples deemed safe, while downweighting or excluding those flagged as unsafe. However, because safety context can shift within a single example, updating the model equally on both harmful and harmless parts of a response is suboptimal-a coarse treatment we term static safety shaping. In contrast, we propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS), a framework that uses fine-grained safety signals to reinforce learning from safe segments of a response while suppressing unsafe content. To enable such fine-grained control during finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally used for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking how safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads to the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal that enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence. Building on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly mitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across diverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising capability on intended tasks.

To identify these interactions, most existing approaches require enumerating all possible combinations of features up to a given order, causing them to scale poorly with the number of inputs $n$. Recently, Kang et al. (2025) proposed SPEX, an information-theoretic approach that uses interaction sparsity to scale to $n \\approx 10^3$ features. SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires tens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large models. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often hierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order subsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy, we propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits gradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important interactions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets show that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over marginal attribution approaches while using $10\\times$ fewer inferences than SPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX efficiently identifies the most influential features, providing a scalable approximation of their Shapley values. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data attribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples that influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we uncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on a question-answering task."}

Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, we show that analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the state is highly valuable when investigating more general SA architectures without necessarily admitting an energy function. It reveals that the normalization layer plays an essential role in suppressing the Lipschitzness of SA and the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, which correspond to the oscillatory components of the dynamics. In addition, the Lyapunov exponents computed from the Jacobians demonstrate that the normalized dynamics lie close to a critical state, and this criticality serves as a strong indicator of high inference performance. Furthermore, the Jacobian perspective also enables us to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics."}

The optimization landscape of these functions is often highly complex and textured, even fractal-like, with many spurious local minima, ill-conditioned valleys, degenerate points, and saddle points. Complicating things further is the fact that these landscape characteristics are a function of the data, meaning that noise in the training data can propagate forward and give rise to unrepresentative small-scale geometry. This poses a difficulty for gradient-based optimization methods, which rely on local geometry to compute updates and are, therefore, vulnerable to being derailed by noisy data. In practice,this translates to a strong dependence of the optimization dynamics on the noise in the data, i.e., poor generalization performance. To remediate this problem, we propose a new optimization procedure: Rolling Ball Optimizer (RBO), that breaks this spatial locality by incorporating information from a larger region of the loss landscape in its updates. We achieve this by simulating the motion of a rigid sphere of finite radius rolling on the loss landscape, a straightforward generalization of Gradient Descent (GD) that simplifies into it in the infinitesimal limit. The radius serves as a hyperparameter that determines the scale at which RBO sees the loss landscape, allowing control over the granularity of its interaction therewith. We are motivated by the intuition that the large-scale geometry of the loss landscape is less data-specific than its fine-grained structure, and that it is easier to optimize. We support this intuition by proving that our algorithm has a smoothing effect on the loss function. Evaluation against SGD, SAM, and Entropy-SGD, on MNIST and CIFAR-10/100 demonstrates promising results in terms of convergence speed, training accuracy, and generalization performance."}

Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings."}

In practice, neural networks (NNs) trained with SGD are known to exhibit simplicity bias -- a tendency to find simple solutions. In contrast, we show that Adam is more resistant to such simplicity bias. First, we investigate the differences in the implicit biases of Adam and GD when training two-layer ReLU NNs on a binary classification task with Gaussian data. We find that GD exhibits a simplicity bias, resulting in a linear decision boundary with a suboptimal margin, whereas Adam leads to much richer and more diverse features, producing a nonlinear boundary that is closer to the Bayes' optimal predictor. This richer decision boundary also allows Adam to achieve higher test accuracy both in-distribution and under certain distribution shifts. We theoretically prove these results by analyzing the population gradients. Next, to corroborate our theoretical findings, we present extensive empirical results showing that this property of Adam leads to superior generalization across various datasets with spurious correlations where NNs trained with SGD are known to show simplicity bias and do not generalize well under certain distributional shifts."}

To address this, we propose the Feasibility-Seeking Neural Network (FSNet), which integrates a feasibility-seeking step directly into its solution procedure to ensure constraint satisfaction. This feasibility-seeking step solves an unconstrained optimization problem that minimizes constraint violations in a differentiable manner, enabling end-to-end training and providing guarantees on feasibility and convergence.

However, all existing GNN-based approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments (UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies over time in practice.

Unlike prior approaches that fuse modalities at a coarse level, CogniAlign leverages a word-level temporal alignment strategy that synchronizes audio embeddings with corresponding textual tokens based on transcription timestamps. This alignment supports the development of token-level fusion techniques, enabling more precise cross-modal interactions. To fully exploit this alignment, we propose a Gated Cross-Attention Fusion mechanism, where audio features attend over textual representations, guided by the superior unimodal performance of the text modality.

This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e. learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2) a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions required to combine these and other components for stable and sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three benchmarks, our approach SAILOR consistently out-performs state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.

The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising objective.

We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism inspired by experience replay in traditional RL. This technique reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.

A few steps of finetuning can revert their effects. We begin by showing that this is true even for an idealized form of unlearning: training to imitate a model that was never trained on unwanted information. This shows that training a model can drastically modify its input-output behavior while leaving its underlying capabilities intact. In light of this dynamic, we show our main result. Training a randomly initialized student on the outputs of an unlearned model transfers behaviors while leaving latent capabilities behind. In short, distillation robustifies unlearning. Based on this result, we propose Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an unlearned model into a noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting, UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability removal."}

In this paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic framework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks trained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in this regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus where neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons rapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step process: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a cost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each iteration, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and a drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these drops, matching experiments across several commonly studied architectures. We show that AGF unifies and extends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks and attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular modes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we prove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization. Applying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give the first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that networks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude. Altogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning in neural networks."}

To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and non-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods."}

Unlike traditional bandit formulations that focus solely on expected returns, our objective is to efficiently and accurately identify the Pareto-optimal set of arms that strikes the best trade-off between expected performance and risk. We propose a unified meta-algorithmic framework capable of operating under both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, achieved through adaptive design of confidence intervals tailored to each scenario using the same sample exploration strategy.

Here, we seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds across different task encodings as long as the training distribution sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known concepts."}

Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1) leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward manipulation tasks."}

Nonetheless, these guarantees only hold if the calibration and test data are exchangeable, a condition that is difficult to verify and often violated in practice due to so-called distribution shifts. The literature is rife with methods to mitigate the loss in coverage in this non-exchangeable setting, but these methods require some prior information on the type of distribution shift to be expected at test time. In this work, we study this problem via a new perspective, through the lens of optimal transport, and show that it is possible to estimate the loss in coverage and mitigate arbitrary distribution shifts, offering a principled and broadly applicable solution."}

However, its performance with \\emph{approximate} posteriors -- common in large-scale or neural problems -- has not been benchmarked. We provide the first systematic study of FG-TS and its smoothed variant (SFG-TS) across eleven real-world and synthetic benchmarks. To evaluate their robustness, we compare performance across settings with exact posteriors (linear and logistic bandits) to approximate regimes produced by fast but coarse stochastic-gradient samplers.

Seeking a practical solution, we look towards label smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for overconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing is sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However, settings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in particular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs).

To address these limitations, we propose PolyJuice, the first black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming method for SIDs, based on an observed distribution shift in the T2I latent space between samples correctly and incorrectly classified by the SID. PolyJuice generates attacks by (i) identifying the direction of this shift through a lightweight offline process that only requires black-box access to the SID, and (ii) exploiting this direction by universally steering all generated images towards the SID's failure modes. PolyJuice-steered T2I models are significantly more effective at deceiving SIDs (up to 84%) compared to their unsteered counterparts. We also show that the steering directions can be estimated efficiently at lower resolutions and transferred to higher resolutions using simple interpolation, reducing computational overhead. Finally, tuning SID models on PolyJuice-augmented datasets notably enhances the performance of the detectors (up to 30%)."}

We disentangle these questions using grokking, a training regime in which memorization precedes generalization, allowing us to temporally separate generalization from training dynamics and we find that while both neural collapse and relative flatness emerge near the onset of generalization, only flatness consistently predicts it. Models encouraged to collapse or prevented from collapsing generalize equally well, whereas models regularized away from flat solutions exhibit delayed generalization, resembling grokking, even in architectures and datasets where it does not typically occur. Furthermore, we show theoretically that neural collapse leads to relative flatness under classical assumptions, explaining their empirical co-occurrence.

We present a prototype Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible, unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via Bayesian optimization.

Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while drastically reducing computational overhead."}

This paper presents RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that integrates ML and wireless communication.

Combined with tailored and efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning. Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network microcontroller training by up to 2x.

In each round, the learner selects a vector $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a set $X \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\\boldsymbol{y}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\\langle \\boldsymbol{x}_t, \\boldsymbol{y}_t \\rangle \\in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems, including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log |X|}\\big)$ after $T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\\sqrt{\\log d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\\Omega\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log(|X|)/\\log d}\\big)$ that holds for any algorithm.

At the same time, we show that Hedge is optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical $K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD) algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret guarantees for DAGs."}

We formalize conditional coverage with respect to the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based (CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA) to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate, and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in prediction-set size."}

To resolve this limitation, we introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian distillation outperforms existing baselines.

However, few practical approaches achieve the gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration -- often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking. Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal oracle behavior more closely."}

We provide a lower bound matching our upper bound up to a polynomial term, thereby characterizing the exponential convergence rate for entropy regularization. Our proof relies on the observation that the solutions of entropy-regularized Markov decision processes solve a gradient flow of the unregularized reward with respect to a Riemannian metric common in natural policy gradient methods. This correspondence allows us to identify the limit of this gradient flow as the generalized maximum entropy optimal policy, thereby characterizing the implicit bias of this gradient flow, which corresponds to a time-continuous version of the natural policy gradient method. We use our improved error estimates to show that for entropy-regularized natural policy gradient methods, the overall error decays exponentially in the square root of the number of iterations, improving over existing sublinear guarantees. Finally, we extend our analysis to settings beyond the entropy. In particular, we characterize the implicit bias regarding general convex potentials and their resulting generalized natural policy gradients."}

The cost of even a single failure is significant, as all GPUs need to idle wait until the failure is resolved, potentially losing considerable training progress as training has to restart from checkpoints. This problem is exacerbated by the growing use of spot instances on public clouds for model training, which despite offering substantial cost savings, introduce frequent preemptions-essentially failures that regularly occur throughout the training process. Existing solutions for efficient fault-tolerant training either lack elasticity or rely on building resiliency into pipeline parallelism, which cannot be applied to MoE models due to the expert parallelism strategy adopted by the MoE architecture.We present Lazarus, a system for resilient and elastic training of MoE models. Lazarus adaptively allocates expert replicas to address the inherent imbalance in expert workload and speeds up training, while a provably optimal expert placement algorithm is developed to maximize the probability of recovery upon failures. Through adaptive expert placement and a flexible token dispatcher, Lazarus can also fully utilize all available nodes after failures, leaving no GPU idle. Our evaluation shows that Lazarus outperforms existing MoE training systems by up to 5.7x under frequent node failures and 3.4x on a real spot instance trace."}

We show that optimal fair representations possess several useful structural properties, and that these properties enable a reduction of the computation of the Pareto Front to a compact discrete problem. We then also show that these compact approximating problems can be efficiently solved via off-the shelf concave-convex programming methods.Since our approach is independent of the specific model of representations, it may be used as the benchmark to which representation learning algorithms may be compared.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) serves as a primary tool for mapping these networks by correlating blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across different brain regions, defined as regions of interest (ROIs). Constructing these brain networks involves using atlases to parcellate the brain into ROIs based on various hypotheses of brain division. However, there is no standard atlas for brain network classification, leading to limitations in detecting abnormalities in disorders. Some recent methods have proposed utilizing multiple atlases, but they neglect consistency across atlases and lack ROI-level information exchange. To tackle these limitations, we propose an Atlas-Integrated Distillation and Fusion network (AIDFusion) to improve brain network classification using fMRI data. AIDFusion addresses the challenge of utilizing multiple atlases by employing a disentangle Transformer to filter out inconsistent atlas-specific information and distill distinguishable connections across atlases. It also incorporates subject- and population-level consistency constraints to enhance cross-atlas consistency. Additionally, AIDFusion employs an inter-atlas message-passing mechanism to fuse complementary information across brain regions.

Considering that the FR task can leverage large-scale training data, which intrinsically contains significant structure information, we aim to investigate how to encode such critical structure information into the latent space. As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space. To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE. Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model. To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples.

Here, we introduce FOND (Free energy Online Natural-gradient Dynamics), a framework that derives neural inference dynamics from three principles: (1) natural gradients on F, (2) online belief updating, and (3) iterative refinement. We apply FOND to derive iP-VAE (iterative Poisson variational autoencoder), a recurrent spiking neural network that performs variational inference through membrane potential dynamics, replacing amortized encoders with iterative inference updates. Theoretically, iP-VAE yields several desirable features such as emergent normalization via lateral competition, and hardware-efficient integer spike count representations. Empirically, iP-VAE outperforms both standard VAEs and Gaussian-based predictive coding models in sparsity, reconstruction, and biological plausibility, and scales to complex color image datasets such as CelebA. iP-VAE also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution inputs, exceeding hybrid iterative-amortized VAEs.

For any fixed $\\epsilon$, the runtime is polynomial in $n_3$. When $n_2 = n_3 = n$, our condition on the rank gives a factor-of-2 improvement over the classical simultaneous diagonalization algorithm, which requires $r \\le n$, and also improves on the recent algorithm of Koiran (2024) which requires $r \\le 4n/3$.

Furthermore, for $n \\times n \\times n$ tensors, we show that an even more general class of degree-$d$ polynomial flattenings cannot surpass rank $Cn$ for a constant $C = C(d)$.

We conduct a systematic analysis across different MoE configurations and model scales. We find that moderate parameter activation per sample provides the best trade-off between performance and efficiency. However, as the number of activated parameters increases, the benefits of MoE diminish. Our analysis yields several practical insights for vision MoE design. First, MoE layers most effectively strengthen tiny and mid-sized models, while gains taper off for large-capacity networks and do not redefine state-of-the-art ImageNet performance. Second, a Last-2 placement heuristic offers the most robust cross-architecture choice, with Every-2 slightly better for Vision Transform (ViT), and both remaining effective as data and model scale increase. Third, larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-21k) allow more experts, up to 16, for ConvNeXt to be utilized effectively without changing placement, as increased data reduces overfitting and promotes broader expert specialization.

We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to generate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would significantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice that existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple tokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the conditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for few-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which uses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution to the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network to distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the training data of the original AR model, making it more practical. We evaluate DD on state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on ImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step generation (6.3$\\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19 to 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an 217.8$\\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35.

However, both OW and GST are restricted to measures with equal total mass, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios where mass variation is common, and input measures may have noisy supports, or outliers. To address unbalanced measures, OW can either incorporate mass constraints or marginal discrepancy penalization, but this leads to a more complex two-level optimization problem. Additionally, GST provides a scalable yet rigid framework, which poses significant challenges to extend GST to accommodate nonnegative measures. To tackle these challenges, in this work we revisit the entropy partial transport (EPT) problem. By exploiting Caffarelli & McCann (2010)'s insights, we develop a novel variant of EPT endowed with Orlicz geometric structure, called Orlicz-EPT. We establish theoretical background to solve Orlicz-EPT using a binary search algorithmic approach. Especially, by leveraging the dual EPT and the underlying graph structure, we formulate a novel regularization approach that leads to the proposed Orlicz-Sobolev transport (OST).

In this work, we apply tools from Random Matrix Theory to investigate how such limitations affect similarity measures, focusing on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). We propose an analytical framework for representational similarity analysis that relates measured similarities to the spectral properties of the underlying representations. We demonstrate that neural similarities are systematically underestimated under finite neuron sampling, mainly due to eigenvector delocalization. Moreover, for power-law population spectra, we show that the number of localized eigenvectors scales as the square root of the number of recorded neurons, providing a simple rule of thumb for practitioners. To overcome sampling bias, we introduce a denoising method to infer population-level similarity, enabling accurate analysis even with small neuron samples. Theoretical predictions are validated on synthetic and real datasets, offering practical strategies for interpreting neural data under finite sampling constraints."}

Pereira,Jendrik Seipp", "title": "Classical Planning with LLM-Generated Heuristics: Challenging the State of the Art with Python Code", "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various artificial intelligence problems. However, they fail to plan reliably, even when prompted with a detailed definition of the planning task. Attempts to improve their planning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought prompting, fine-tuning, and explicit \"reasoning\" still yield incorrect plans and usually fail to generalize to larger tasks. In this paper, we show how to use LLMs to generate correct plans, even for out-of-distribution tasks of increasing size. For a given planning domain, we ask an LLM to generate several domain-dependent heuristic functions in the form of Python code, evaluate them on a set of training tasks within a greedy best-first search, and choose the strongest one. The resulting LLM-generated heuristics solve many more unseen test tasks than state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics for classical planning. They are even competitive with the strongest learning algorithm for domain-dependent planning. These findings are especially remarkable given that our proof-of-concept implementation is based on an unoptimized Python planner and the baselines all build upon highly optimized C++ code. In some domains, the LLM-generated heuristics expand fewer states than the baselines, revealing that they are not only efficiently computable, but sometimes even more informative than the state-of-the-art heuristics. Overall, our results show that sampling a set of planning heuristic function programs can significantly improve the planning capabilities of LLMs."}

Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models.

However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model."}

Unlike existing approaches that assume independence between estimation errors and inputs to establish the error bound, a condition often violated in GNRMs, we allow for dependence and our theoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of drawing inference under GNRMs. To implement inference, we consider an Ensemble Subsampling Method (ESM) that leverages U-statistics and the Hoeffding decomposition to construct reliable confidence intervals for DNN estimates. We show that, under GNRM settings, ESM enables model-free variance estimation and accounts for heterogeneity among individuals in the population. Through simulations under nonparametric logistic, Poisson, and binomial regression models, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

In this work, we propose a general learning method for approximating precomputed SDF fields of implicit surfaces by a relatively small number of ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs). The SDF values could be computed from various sources, including point clouds, triangle meshes, analytical expressions, pretrained neural networks, etc. Given SDF values on spatial grid points, our method approximates the SDF using as few ERBFs as possible, achieving a compact representation while preserving the geometric shape of the corresponding implicit surface. To balance sparsity and approximation precision, we introduce a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy, which adaptively incorporates regularization to enforce sparsity and jointly optimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of the ERBFs. For computational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure restricts computations to points near each kernel center, and CUDA-based parallelism further accelerates the optimization. Furthermore, a hierarchical refinement strategy based on SDF spatial grid points progressively incorporates coarse-to-fine samples for parameter initialization and optimization, improving convergence and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can represent SDF fields with significantly fewer parameters than existing sparse implicit representation approaches, achieving better accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

These artifacts emerge due to the model repurposing patch tokens with redundant local information for the storage of global image information. To address this problem, additional register tokens have been incorporated in which the model can store such information instead. We carefully examine the influence of these register tokens on the relationship between global and local image features, showing that while register tokens yield cleaner attention maps, these maps do not accurately reflect the integration of local image information in large models. Instead, global information is dominated by information extracted from register tokens, leading to a disconnect between local and global features. Inspired by these findings, we show that the [CLS] token itself leads to a very similar phenomenon in models without explicit register tokens. Our work shows that care must be taken when interpreting attention maps of large ViTs.

In this paper, we show first that BLEU, a basic string-matching metric, surprisingly matches strong reward models in agreement with human preferences on general instruction-following datasets. Based on this insight, we develop BLEUBERI, a method that first identifies challenging instructions and then applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using BLEU directly as the reward function. We demonstrate that BLEUBERI-trained models are competitive with models trained via reward model-guided RL across four challenging instruction-following benchmarks and three different base language models. A human evaluation further supports that the quality of BLEUBERI model outputs is on par with those from reward model-aligned models. Moreover, BLEUBERI models generate outputs that are more factually grounded than competing methods.

Specifically, our approach enables the model to progressively resolve uncertainty while capturing the structured dependencies among agents, providing a more accurate representation of how agents influence the state. Interestingly, this sequential revelation of agents' actions in a multi-agent system aligns with the reverse process in diffusion models--a class of powerful generative models known for their expressiveness and training stability compared to autoregressive or latent variable models.

Unlike post hoc pruning approaches, we propose a continuous, almost-everywhere differentiable training objective whose global minima are guaranteed to correspond to the sparsest single-hidden-layer ReLU networks that fit the data. This result marks a conceptual advance: it recasts the combinatorial problem of sparse interpolation as a smooth optimization task, potentially enabling the use of gradient-based training methods.

While promising research efforts focus on reducing the size of models, the other half of the equation remains fairly mysterious. Indeed, it is surprising that the standard approach to training remains to iterate over and over, uniformly sampling the training dataset. In this paper we explore a series of alternative training paradigms that leverage insights from hard-data-mining and dropout, simple enough to implement and use that can become the new training standard. The proposed Progressive Data Dropout reduces the number of effective epochs to as little as 12.4% of the baseline. This savings actually do not come at any cost for accuracy. Surprisingly, the proposed method improves accuracy by up to 4.82%. Our approach requires no changes to model architecture or optimizer, and can be applied across standard training pipelines, thus posing an excellent opportunity for wide adoption.

Nevertheless, existing deep learning approaches in hydrology remain largely confined to local-scale applications and do not leverage the inherent spatial connections of bodies of water. Thus, there is a strong need for new deep learning methodologies that are capable of modeling spatio-temporal relations to improve river discharge and flood forecasting for scientific and operational applications. To address this, we present RiverMamba, a novel deep learning model that is pretrained with long-term reanalysis data and that can forecast global river discharge and floods on a $0.05^\\circ$ grid up to $7$ days lead time, which is of high relevance in early warning. To achieve this, RiverMamba leverages efficient Mamba blocks that enable the model to capture spatio-temporal relations in very large river networks and enhance its forecast capability for longer lead times. The forecast blocks integrate ECMWF HRES meteorological forecasts, while accounting for their inaccuracies through spatio-temporal modeling. Our analysis demonstrates that RiverMamba provides reliable predictions of river discharge across various flood return periods, including extreme floods, and lead times, surpassing both AI- and physics-based models.

It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task performance."}

Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in reward-free environments, including a class of methods known as model-based intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and do not converge to an exploratory policy, thus failing to capture robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external reward rather than engaging in ethological, naturalistic and task-independent behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic drive explicitly designed after the principles of autonomous exploration in animals. Our method (3M-Progress) achieves animal-like exploration by tracking divergence between an online world model and a fixed prior learned from an ecological niche. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first autonomous embodied agent that predicts brain data entirely from self-supervised optimization of an intrinsic goal -- without any behavioral or neural training data -- demonstrating that 3M-Progress agents capture the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial dynamics recorded from autonomously behaving larval zebrafish, thereby providing the first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation.

These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a novel method for achieving context-adaptive tokenization in LLMs at inference time. Leveraging an online data compression algorithm (Lempel-Ziv-Welch), zip2zip dynamically expands its active vocabulary at inference time by continuously replacing fragmented token sequences with more compact hypertokens, which it can immediately output during generation. In doing so, the model refines its internal tokenization scheme to match the token distribution of the current context, reducing redundancy and improving representational efficiency. zip2zip consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression that incrementally merges co-occurring tokens into reusable hypertokens on the fly; (2) a dynamic embedding (and unembedding) layer that computes embeddings for newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a variant of autoregressive language modeling that pretrains the model to handle hypertokenized, compressed text sequences as inputs and outputs. We show that an existing LLM can be uptrained for zip2zip in 10 GPU-hours via parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting LLM performs test-time adaptation, learning to use hypertokens in unseen contexts and reducing input and output tokens by 15-40%."}

To address this, we introduce SElf-refining Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization without relying on external models at inference time. SEAL leverages adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are then used to distill anonymization and critique capabilities into SLMs through supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The resulting models learn both to anonymize text and to evaluate their outputs, enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement. Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy protection.

At the core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features.

The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by aligning object-level representations across clients.

This paper introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs specialized agents (factor analyst and argument polisher) in an iterative refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant, rebuttal). We evaluate reflective multi-agent against single-agent, enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e, Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: \"arguable\", \"mismatched\", and \"non-arguable\". Results demonstrate that the reflective multi-agent approach excels at successful abstention by preventing generation when arguments cannot be grounded, improves hallucination accuracy by reducing fabricated and misattributed factors and enhances factor utilization recall by better using the provided case facts.

To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models."}

We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance."}

Current practice, however, focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also faces practical limitations from black-box autoregressive reasoning, where decisions unfold token by token without explicit simulation or counterfactual evaluation of outcomes. Humans, on the other hand, reason and plan by mentally simulating the consequences of actions within an internal model of the world -- a capability that supports flexible, goal-directed behavior across diverse contexts. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of an optimal agent in any general environment, SimuRA addresses the limitations of black-box autoregressive reasoning by incorporating the world model for planning via simulation. Our prototype world model is implemented using LLMs as a substrate, leveraging the natural language as a discrete, hierarchical representation grounded in concepts for planning, while remaining model-agnostic. On complex web-browsing tasks such as flight search, SimuRA improves the success rate from 0% to 32.2% compared to a representative open-web agent baseline. Across tasks, world-model-based planning achieves up to 124% higher task completion rates than a matched black-box autoregressive baseline, demonstrating the advantages of simulative reasoning.

Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets.

Clarkson,Scott W. Linderman", "title": "Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models", "abstract": "The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have shown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a parallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield dramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the difficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger adoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in $O((\\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the optimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable systems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence length. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models."}

We propose a layered approach to understanding hallucination risks, encompassing epistemic instability, user misdirection, and social-scale effects. Drawing on interdisciplinary sources and examining instruments such as the EU AI Act and the GDPR, we show that current governance models struggle to address hallucination when it manifests as ambiguity, bias reinforcement, or normative convergence.

Diffusion-based language models offer a promising alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address this issue by splitting windows into blocks (sacrificing bidirectionality), but we find that this also leads to time-interval expansion problem, sacrificing the speed. Therefore, semi-AR eliminates the main advantages of diffusion models. To overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at positions far from context.

We utilized a pre-trained language model to encode each structured data into corresponding semantic embedding vectors.

In this work, we focus on UQ for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic, token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution. By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance (using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty (avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised (sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a 13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead."}

Such delays render event occurrences unobservable when their reports are subject to right censoring. This issue becomes particularly critical when estimating hazard rates for newly enrolled cohorts with limited follow-up due to administrative censoring. Our study addresses this challenge by jointly modeling the parametric hazard functions of event occurrences and report timings. The joint probability distribution is marginalized over the latent event occurrence status. We construct an estimator for the proposed survival model and establish its asymptotic consistency. Furthermore, we develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to compute its estimates.

RL workflows involve interleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource requirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales efficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training requires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh communication. Existing RL frameworks fall into two categories: co-located and disaggregated architectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing both stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without modifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource under-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances on public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant cost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently harvested for rollout.In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient RL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources. Our key insight is that rollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with preemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these resources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost adopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout offload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster, (2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available instances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient preemption handling and continuous load balancing.

Images and captions can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure, emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful, instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate, instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BioCAP (i.e., BioCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models."}

While researchers have proposed text-based differencing techniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing methods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that operate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in developers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or duplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent such block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling developers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the efficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a text-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of block-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional differencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all possible line mappings and block mappings. Leveraging the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, we then compute the optimal mapping set that can minimize the size of the edit script (ES) while closely aligning with the original developer's intent. To validate the effectiveness of BDiff, we selected five state-of-the-art tools, including large language models (LLMs), as baselines and adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate their performance in terms of ES size, result quality, and running time. Experimental results show that BDiff produces higher-quality differencing results than baseline tools while maintaining competitive runtime performance. Our experiments also show the unreliability of LLMs in code differencing tasks regarding result quality and their infeasibility in terms of runtime efficiency. We have implemented a web-based visual differencing tool."}

DL models support perception modules, equipped with tasks such as object detection and sensor fusion. These DL models enable vehicles to process multi-sensor inputs to understand complex surroundings. Deploying DL models in autonomous driving systems faces stringent challenges, including real-time processing, limited computational resources, and strict power constraints. To address these challenges, automotive DL frameworks (e.g., PaddleInference) have emerged to optimize inference efficiency. However, these frameworks encounter unique quality issues due to their more complex deployment environments, such as crashes stemming from limited scheduled memory and incorrect memory allocation. Unfortunately, existing DL framework testing methods fail to detect these quality issues due to the failure in deploying generated test input models, as these models lack three essential capabilities: (1) multi-input/output tensor processing, (2) multi-modal data processing, and (3) multi-level data feature extraction. These capabilities necessitate specialized model components, which existing testing methods neglect during model generation. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalpel, an automotive DL frameworks testing method that generates test input models at the model component level. Scalpel generates models by assembling model components (heads, necks, backbones) to support capabilities required by autonomous driving systems. Specifically, Scalpel maintains and updates a repository of model components, generating test inputs by selecting, mutating, and assembling them. Successfully generated models are added back to enrich the repository. Newly generated models are then deployed within the autonomous driving system to test automotive DL frameworks via differential testing."}

The mission utilizes major automation concepts for the satellite platform operations, allowing fully automated operations outside of office hours.

Existing approaches do not account for the complex intersection between problem and solution space expressed in GDPR. In this study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system specification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods: We reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with practitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the underlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We developed and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification for PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives. Results: The relationship between problem and solution space, as expressed in GDPR, is instrumental in supporting PbD. We demonstrate how our approach, based on the modeling GDPR content with original legal concepts, contributes to specification objectives of capturing legal knowledge, supporting specification transparency, and traceability. Conclusion: GDPR demands need to be addressed throughout different levels of abstraction in the engineering lifecycle to achieve PbD. Legal knowledge specified in the GDPR text should be captured in specifications to address the demands of different stakeholders and ensure compliance.

This paper introduces a generalist approach, TaskEval, a framework using diverse prompts and Item Response Theory (IRT) to efficiently assess LLMs' capabilities and benchmark task characteristics, improving the understanding of their performance.Using two code generation benchmarks, \\textit{HumanEval}+ and \\textit{ClassEval}, as well as 8 code generation LLMs, we show that \\textit{TaskEval} is capable of characterising the properties of tasks. Using topic analysis, we identify and analyse the tasks of 17 and 21 topics within the benchmarks. We also cross-analyse tasks' characteristics with programming constructs (e.g., variable assignment, conditions, etc.) used by LLMs, emphasising some patterns with tasks' difficulty. Finally, we conduct a comparison between the difficulty assessment of tasks by human annotators and LLMs. Orthogonal to current benchmarking evaluation efforts, \\textit{TaskEval} can assist researchers and practitioners in fostering better assessments of LLMs. The tasks' characteristics can be used to identify shortcomings within existing benchmarks or improve the evaluation of LLMs."}

Previous methods combine tree search with reflection that summarizes past mistakes to achieve iterative improvement. However, these methods face significant challenges. First, they search directly within the code language space, neglecting the underlying reasoning process critical for effective code generation. Second, reflection-based approaches merely accumulate historical errors in memory without providing correct reasoning pathways, making it difficult for subsequent search iterations to identify optimal solutions, resulting in decreased search quality. In this work, we propose RethinkMCTS, a framework that systematically explores and refines the reasoning process for code generation. Specifically, we employ MCTS to search for thoughts before code generation and integrate MCTS with a refinement mechanism called rethink, which incorporates fine-grained code execution feedback to refine erroneous thoughts during the search. It ensures the search path aligns with better reasoning, improving overall search quality. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RethinkMCTS outperforms previous search-based and feedback-enhanced code generation baselines."}

Search-based Toxicity Testing for Large Language Models", "abstract": "Language is a deep-rooted means of perpetration of stereotypes and discrimination. Large Language Models (LLMs), now a pervasive technology in our everyday lives, can cause extensive harm when prone to generating toxic responses. The standard way to address this issue is to align the LLM , which, however, dampens the issue without constituting a definitive solution. Therefore, testing LLM even after alignment efforts remains crucial for detecting any residual deviations with respect to ethical standards. We present EvoTox, an automated testing framework for LLMs' inclination to toxicity, providing a way to quantitatively assess how much LLMs can be pushed towards toxic responses even in the presence of alignment. The framework adopts an iterative evolution strategy that exploits the interplay between two LLMs, the System Under Test (SUT) and the Prompt Generator steering SUT responses toward higher toxicity. The toxicity level is assessed by an automated oracle based on an existing toxicity classifier. We conduct a quantitative and qualitative empirical evaluation using five state-of-the-art LLMs as evaluation subjects having increasing complexity (7-671B parameters). Our quantitative evaluation assesses the cost-effectiveness of four alternative versions of EvoTox against existing baseline methods, based on random search, curated datasets of toxic prompts, and adversarial attacks. Our qualitative assessment engages human evaluators to rate the fluency of the generated prompts and the perceived toxicity of the responses collected during the testing sessions. Results indicate that the effectiveness, in terms of detected toxicity level, is significantly higher than the selected baseline methods (effect size up to 1.0 against random search and up to 0.99 against adversarial attacks). Furthermore, EvoTox yields a limited cost overhead (from 22% to 35% on average)."}

This has led to the emergence of AI for Software Engineering as a distinct research area within the field of software engineering. With the development of quantum computing, the field of Quantum AI (QAI) is arising, enhancing the performance of classical AI and holding significant potential for solving classical software engineering problems. Some initial applications of QAI in software engineering have already emerged, such as test case optimization. However, the path ahead remains open, offering ample opportunities to solve complex software engineering problems cost-effectively with QAI. To this end, this paper presents a roadmap towards the application of QAI in software engineering. Specifically, we consider two of the main categories of QAI, i.e., quantum optimization algorithms and quantum machine learning. For each software engineering phase, we discuss how these QAI approaches can address some of the tasks associated with that phase. Moreover, we provide an overview of some of the possible challenges that need to be addressed to make the application of QAI for software engineering successful."}

One critical bottleneck in addressing code hallucination is the difficulty of identifying the functional correctness of generated code, due to its unnatural form. We address this core bottleneck by automatically generating unit tests using dynamic code analysis tools, leveraging the \\emph{executable nature} of code. Accordingly, we propose \\emph{selective code generator} that abstains from uncertain generations -- based on the functional correctness evaluated by generated unit tests -- to theoretically control the correctness among non-abstained answers, \\ie the false discovery rate. Finally, we propose to use generated unit tests in evaluation as well as in learning for precise code evaluation, calling this paradigm \\emph{FuzzEval}. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method along with the controllability of code hallucination and reasonable selection efficiency."}

While powerful, they often suffer from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve. Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce TAI3, an API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed benchmarks or adversarial inputs, TAI3 generates realistic tasks based on toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency, TAI3 maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs demonstrate that TAI3 effectively uncovers intent integrity violations, significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query efficiency. Moreover, TAI3 generalizes well to stronger target models using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across domains."}

We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance."}

To address these limitations, we present E2EDev, a novel benchmark grounded in the principles of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), which evaluates the capabilities of E2ESD frameworks by assessing whether the generated software meets user needs through mimicking real user interactions (Figure 1). E2EDev comprises (i) a fine-grained set of user requirements, (ii) multiple BDD test scenarios with corresponding Python step implementations for each requirement, and (iii) a fully automated testing pipeline built on the Behave framework. To ensure its quality while reducing the annotation effort, E2EDev leverages our proposed Human-in-the-Loop Multi-Agent Annotation Framework (HITL-MAA). By evaluating various E2ESD frameworks and LLM backbones with E2EDev, our analysis reveals a persistent struggle to effectively solve these tasks, underscoring the critical need for more effective and cost-efficient E2ESD solutions.

This research was conducted with the aim of designing and implementing an integrated and reproducible infrastructure for the development, building, and testing of a Linux-based operating system using the Yocto Project. The proposed structure was implemented based on a three-layer architecture consisting of the main Yocto repositories, a custom layer (meta-custom), and a coordinating manifest layer to ensure version synchronization, scalability, and reproducibility. Three sample projects, including libhelloworld, helloworld, and the kernel module hello mod, were developed and integrated into the build process. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines were implemented with GitLab CI and combined with an isolated Docker environment to automate and streamline the build and testing workflows. Using a local cache server containing hashserv, downloads and sstate cache significantly reduced the build time. The functionality and stability of the system were verified through six boot test scenarios in the QEMU simulator. The results show that the proposed design not only ensures reproducibility but also can be extended to advanced applications such as continuous deployment of real-time Linux versions. Future recommendations include expanding automated tests, implementing system monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, using distributed builds, optimizing with Docker multi-stage builds, and enabling continuous deployment of real-time Linux changes to provide a stable and scalable model for industrial and research projects in embedded systems with a rapid and reliable development cycle."}

In High-Performance Graph Processing, a thorough evaluation of contributions becomes more achievable by supporting common input formats over different frameworks. However, each framework creates its specific format, which may not support reading large-scale real-world graph datasets. This shows a demand for high-performance libraries capable of loading graphs to (i) accelerate designing new graph algorithms, (ii) to evaluate the contributions on a wide range of graph algorithms, and (iii) to facilitate easy and fast comparison over different graph frameworks.To that end, we present ParaGrapher, a high-performance API and library for loading large-scale and compressed graphs. ParaGrapher supports different types of requests for accessing graphs in shared- and distributed-memory and out-of-core graph processing. We explain the design of ParaGrapher and present a performance model of graph decompression, which is used for evaluation of ParaGrapher over three storage types. Our evaluation shows that by decompressing compressed graphs in WebGraph format, ParaGrapher delivers up to 3.2 times speedup in loading and up to 5.2 times speedup in end-to-end execution in comparison to the binary and textual formats.ParaGrapher is available online onthis https URL."}

It is worth noting that, the operation of mechanical equipment is accompanied by changes in factors such as speed and load, leading to significant differences in data distribution, which pose challenges for fault diagnosis. Additionally, in terms of application deployment, commonly used cloud-based fault diagnosis methods often encounter issues such as time delays and data security concerns, while common fault diagnosis methods cannot be directly applied to edge computing devices. Therefore, conducting fault diagnosis under cross-operating conditions based on edge computing holds significant research value. This paper proposes a domain-adaptation-based lightweight fault diagnosis framework tailored for edge computing scenarios. Incorporating the local maximum mean discrepancy into knowledge transfer aligns the feature distributions of different domains in a high-dimensional feature space, to discover a common feature space across domains. The acquired fault diagnosis expertise from the cloud-based deep neural network model is transferred to the lightweight edge-based model (edge model) using adaptation knowledge transfer methods. It aims to achieve accurate fault diagnosis under cross-working conditions while ensuring real-time diagnosis capabilities. We utilized the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX kit as the edge computing platform and conducted validation experiments on two devices. In terms of diagnostic performance, the proposed method significantly improved diagnostic accuracy, with average increases of 34.44% and 17.33% compared to existing methods, respectively."}

However, maintaining these systems requires substantial effort, as they are inevitably prone to bugs and continually evolve to meet changing external requirements. Therefore, automatically resolving agent issues (i.e., bug reports or feature requests) is a crucial and challenging task. While recent software engineering (SE) agents (e.g., SWE-agent) have shown promise in addressing issues in traditional software systems, it remains unclear how effectively they can resolve real-world issues in agent systems, which differ significantly from traditional software. To fill this gap, we first manually analyze 201 real-world agent issues and identify common categories of agent issues. We then spend 500 person-hours constructing AgentIssue-Bench, a reproducible benchmark comprising 50 agent issue resolution tasks (each with an executable environment and failure-triggering tests). We further evaluate state-of-the-art SE agents on AgentIssue-Bench and reveal their limited effectiveness (i.e., with only 0.67% - 4.67% resolution rates). These results underscore the unique challenges of maintaining agent systems compared to traditional software, highlighting the need for further research to develop advanced SE agents for resolving agent issues.
