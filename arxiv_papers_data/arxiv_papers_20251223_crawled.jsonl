Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction."}

Prior work on summarization and query-aware compression largely ignores the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency.

We address these barriers using simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently varying realistic and symbolic threat while tracking actions, language, and attitudes. Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups."}

Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level. We recover the standard recursive value function as a special case. However, our most general expected utilities under the death interpretation cannot be characterized as such Choquet integrals."}

While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in two distinct prompting settings on two datasets."}

To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency."}

Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates.

Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction. Ablation results demonstrate that speculative execution without correction is unreliable over longer horizons, highlighting the necessity of mismatch-aware correction for robust latency reduction."}

To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit."}

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off."}

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance."}

In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure.

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design.

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality.

We propose a graph-based deep learning framework to detect epilepsy from low-cost Electroencephalography (EEG) hardware, tested on recordings from Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau. Our focus is on fair, accessible automatic assessment and explainability to shed light on epilepsy biomarkers. Methods: We model EEG signals as spatio-temporal graphs, classify them, and identify interchannel relationships and temporal dynamics using graph attention networks (GAT). To emphasize connectivity biomarkers, we adapt the inherently node-focused GAT to analyze edges. We also designed signal preprocessing for low-fidelity recordings and a lightweight GAT architecture trained on Google Colab and deployed on RaspberryPi devices. Results: The approach achieves promising classification performance, outperforming a standard classifier based on random forest and graph convolutional networks in terms of accuracy and robustness over multiple sessions, but also highlighting specific connections in the fronto-temporal region. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential of GATs to provide insightful and scalable diagnostic support for epilepsy in underserved regions, paving the way for affordable and accessible neurodiagnostic tools."}

By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality. Our proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark, highlighting its potential for both academic research and real-world applications."}

New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir. Particularly representations of finer branches contribute to the decisions of the models. The models consider those tree species similar to each other which a human expert would also regard as similar. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of the decision processes of tree species classification models to help reveal data set and model limitations, biases, and to build confidence in model predictions."}

This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations."}

While this experience learning capability enhances agentic autonomy, it introduces a critical, unexplored attack surface, i.e., the trust boundary between an agent's reasoning core and its own past. In this paper, we introduce MemoryGraft. It is a novel indirect injection attack that compromises agent behavior not through immediate jailbreaks, but by implanting malicious successful experiences into the agent's long-term memory. Unlike traditional prompt injections that are transient, or standard RAG poisoning that targets factual knowledge, MemoryGraft exploits the agent's semantic imitation heuristic which is the tendency to replicate patterns from retrieved successful tasks. We demonstrate that an attacker who can supply benign ingestion-level artifacts that the agent reads during execution can induce it to construct a poisoned RAG store where a small set of malicious procedure templates is persisted alongside benign experiences. When the agent later encounters semantically similar tasks, union retrieval over lexical and embedding similarity reliably surfaces these grafted memories, and the agent adopts the embedded unsafe patterns, leading to persistent behavioral drift across sessions. We validate MemoryGraft on MetaGPT's DataInterpreter agent with GPT-4o and find that a small number of poisoned records can account for a large fraction of retrieved experiences on benign workloads, turning experience-based self-improvement into a vector for stealthy and durable compromise.

In this work, we address this gap by providing the first comparative analysis of search engine in Wikipedia and Grokipedia.Using nearly 10,000 neutral English words and their substrings as queries, we collect over 70,000 search engine results and examine their semantic alignment, overlap, and topical structure. We find that both platforms frequently generate results that are weakly related to the original query and, in many cases, surface unexpected content starting from innocuous queries.

However, recent studies show that these DL-based systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks; small perturbations to sensor inputs can degrade model performance, trigger incorrect mitigation, and disrupt the user's immersive experience (UIX). Additionally, there is a lack of dedicated open-source testbeds that evaluate the robustness of these systems under adversarial conditions, limiting the ability to assess their real-world effectiveness. To address this gap, this paper introduces Adversarial-VR, a novel real-time VR testbed for evaluating DL-based cybersickness detection and mitigation strategies under adversarial conditions. Developed in Unity, the testbed integrates two state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL models: DeepTCN and Transformer, which are trained on the open-source MazeSick dataset, for real-time cybersickness severity detection and applies a dynamic visual tunneling mechanism that adjusts the field-of-view based on model outputs. To assess robustness, we incorporate three SOTA adversarial attacks: MI-FGSM, PGD, and C&W, which successfully prevent cybersickness mitigation by fooling DL-based cybersickness models' outcomes. We implement these attacks using a testbed with a custom-built VR Maze simulation and an HTC Vive Pro Eye headset, and we open-source our implementation for widespread adoption by VR developers and researchers. Results show that these adversarial attacks are capable of successfully fooling the system. For instance, the C&W attack results in a $5.94x decrease in accuracy for the Transformer-based cybersickness model compared to the accuracy without the attack."}

Conformal prediction (CP) provides a simple, distribution-free framework for calibrating arbitrary predictive models without retraining, yielding rigorous uncertainty quantification with finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal exchangeability assumptions, without reliance on asymptotics, limit theorems, or Gaussian approximations. In this work, we investigate CP as a unifying calibration layer for machine-learning applications in high-energy physics. Using publicly available collider datasets and a diverse set of models, we show that a single conformal formalism can be applied across regression, binary and multi-class classification, anomaly detection, and generative modelling, converting raw model outputs into statistically valid prediction sets, typicality regions, and p-values with controlled false-positive rates. While conformal prediction does not improve raw model performance, it enforces honest uncertainty quantification and transparent error control. We argue that conformal calibration should be adopted as a standard component of machine-learning pipelines in collider physics, enabling reliable interpretation, robust comparisons, and principled statistical decisions in experimental and phenomenological analyses."}

Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs."}

This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations."}

Most bot-detection systems still treat behavioural features as static, implicitly assuming bots behave stationarily over time. We test that assumption for promotional Twitter bots, analysing change in both individual behavioural signals and the relationships between them. Using 2,615 promotional bot accounts and 2.8M tweets, we build yearly time series for ten content-based meta-features. Augmented Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests plus linear trends show all ten are non-stationary: nine increase over time, while language diversity declines slightly.Stratifying by activation generation and account age reveals systematic differences: second-generation bots are most active and link-heavy; short-lived bots show intense, repetitive activity with heavy hashtag/URL use; long-lived bots are less active but more linguistically diverse and use emojis more variably. We then analyse co-occurrence across generations using 18 interpretable binary features spanning actions, topic similarity, URLs, hashtags, sentiment, emojis, and media (153 pairs). Chi-square tests indicate almost all pairs are dependent. Spearman correlations shift in strength and sometimes polarity: many links (e.g. multiple hashtags with media; sentiment with URLs) strengthen, while others flip from weakly positive to weakly or moderately negative. Later generations show more structured combinations of cues.Taken together, these studies provide evidence that promotional social bots adapt over time at both the level of individual meta-features and the level of feature interdependencies, with direct implications for the design and evaluation of bot-detection systems trained on historical behavioural features."}

We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best. These findings demonstrate that exposure to flawed traces during training can improve error-recovery behavior without sacrificing accuracy, suggesting a path toward more robust mathematical reasoning in LLMs."}

Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection."}

However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN.

Our parameterizations unlock efficient marginalization even in factorizations different from TNs, but encoded as circuits, whose structure would otherwise make marginalization computationally hard.

The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples.

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants."}

Traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods, which often rely on feature-based or example-based explanations, struggle to deliver dynamic, context-specific, personalized, and human-centric insights for everyday AR users. These methods typically address separate explainability dimensions (e.g., when, what, how) with different explanation techniques, resulting in unrealistic and fragmented experiences for seamless AR interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PILAR, a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate context-aware, personalized explanations, offering a more intuitive and trustworthy experience in real-time AI-powered AR systems. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on multiple techniques for different aspects of explanation, PILAR employs a unified LLM-based approach that dynamically adapts explanations to the user's needs, fostering greater trust and engagement. We implement the PILAR concept in a real-world AR application (e.g., personalized recipe recommendations), an open-source prototype that integrates real-time object detection, recipe recommendation, and LLM-based personalized explanations of the recommended recipes based on users' dietary preferences. We evaluate the effectiveness of PILAR through a user study with 16 participants performing AR-based recipe recommendation tasks, comparing an LLM-based explanation interface to a traditional template-based one. Results show that the LLM-based interface significantly enhances user performance and experience, with participants completing tasks 40% faster and reporting greater satisfaction, ease of use, and perceived transparency."}

This paper reveals an unexpected phenomenon in IRL: when given a choice between teachers with different reward structures, learning agents overwhelmingly prefer conservative, low-reward teachers (93.16% selection rate) over those offering 20x higher rewards. Through 1,250 experimental runs in navigation tasks with multiple expert teachers, we discovered: (1) Conservative bias dominates teacher selection: agents systematically choose the lowest-reward teacher, prioritising consistency over optimality; (2) Critical performance thresholds exist at teacher availability rho >= 0.6 and accuracy omega >= 0.6, below which the framework fails catastrophically; (3) The framework achieves 159% improvement over baseline Q-learning under concept drift. These findings challenge fundamental assumptions about optimal teaching in RL and suggest potential implications for human-robot collaboration, where human preferences for safety and consistency may align with the observed agent selection behaviour, potentially informing training paradigms for safety-critical robotic applications."}

The development of the diffusion models (DM) and the end-to-end models (E2E model) has greatly improved the frontier of pansharping. DM takes the multi-step diffusion to obtain an accurate estimation of the residual between LRMSI and HRMSI. However, the multi-step process takes large computational power and is time-consuming. As for E2E models, their performance is still limited by the lack of prior and simple structure. In this paper, we propose a novel four-stage training strategy to obtain a lightweight network Fose, which fuses one-step DM and an E2E model. We perform one-step distillation on an enhanced SOTA DM for pansharping to compress the inference process from 50 steps to only 1 step.

However, when faced with complex and curved pipeline scenarios, these methods often fail due to problems such as cable entanglement and insufficient equipment flexibility. To address this pain point, we designed a self-propelled pipeline robot. This robot can autonomously complete the location work of complex and curved pipelines in complex pipe networks without external dragging. In terms of pipeline mapping technology, traditional visual mapping and laser mapping methods are easily affected by lighting conditions and insufficient features in the confined space of pipelines, resulting in mapping drift and divergence problems. In contrast, the pipeline location method that integrates inertial navigation and wheel odometers is less affected by pipeline environmental factors. Based on this, this paper proposes a pipeline robot location method based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF). Firstly, the body attitude angle is initially obtained through an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Then, the extended Kalman filtering algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of attitude angle estimation. Finally, high-precision pipeline location is achieved by combining wheel odometers. During the testing phase, the roll wheels of the pipeline robot needed to fit tightly against the pipe wall to reduce slippage. However, excessive tightness would reduce the flexibility of motion control due to excessive friction. Therefore, a balance needed to be struck between the robot's motion capability and positioning accuracy. Experiments were conducted using the self-propelled pipeline robot in a rectangular loop pipeline, and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed dead reckoning algorithm."}

Based on these issues, this study aims to formulate a comprehensive Islamic ethical framework that can serve as a more comprehensive preventative tool to mitigate the risks of misuse of deepfakes. The study employed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) guided by PRISMA, selecting ten primary sources published between 2018 and 2025 to identify ethical deficiencies, regulatory needs, and appropriate normative solutions. The analysis shows that the integration of the principles of (Maqasid al-Shariah) particularly (hifz al-ird) protecting honor and (hifz al-nafs) protecting the self, provides a strong normative basis for regulating the responsible use of technology. This study yields three strategic recommendations: regulatory changes that recognize the intangible and psychological harm caused by reputational damage; improved technology management through moral scrutiny that upholds the values of justice (adl), trust, and openness; and increased public digital literacy based on the principle of (tabayyun) examination and caution.

The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required.The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist.

Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own.

The DAgger stage equips the policy with fundamental capabilities to handle disengagement states through direct imitation of expert interventions. Subsequently, the DPO stage refines the policy's behavior to better align with expert preferences in disengagement scenarios. Through multiple iterations, the policy progressively learns recovery strategies for disengagement states, thereby mitigating the open-loop gap. Experiments on the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate our method's effectiveness compared with pure IL methods, with comprehensive ablations confirming the contribution of each component."}

However, the overall effectiveness of BSARec and the roles of its individual components have yet to be systematically validated. We reproduce BSARec and show that it outperforms other SR methods on some datasets. To empirically assess whether BSARec improves performance on high-frequency signals, we propose a metric to quantify user history frequency and evaluate SR methods across different user groups. We compare digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and find that the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) offer only slight improvements over Fourier transforms, and DSP methods provide no clear advantage over simple residual connections.

Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility.

Based on real-world evidence from democratic innovations in participatory budgeting, in Switzerland and beyond, I highlight a trilogy of key research results: Fair voting methods achieve to be (i) legitimacy incubator, (ii) novel impact accelerator and (iii) safeguard for risks of artificial intelligence (AI). Compared to majoritarian voting methods, combining expressive ballot formats (e.g. cumulative voting) with ballot aggregation methods that promote proportional representation (e.g. equal shares) results in more winners and higher (geographical) representation of citizens. Such fair voting methods are preferred and found fairer even by voters who do not win, while promoting stronger democratic values for citizens such as altruism and compromise. They also result in new resourceful ideas to put for voting, which are cost-effective and win, especially in areas of welfare, education and culture. Strikingly, fair voting methods are also more resilient to biases and inconsistencies of generative AI in emerging scenarios of AI voting assistance or AI representation of voters who would be likely to abstain. I also review the relevance of such upgrades for democracies in crisis, such as the one of Greece featured in the recent study of `Unmute Democracy'. Greek democracy can build stronger resilience via higher representation of citizens in democratic processes as well as democratic innovations in participation. Fair voting methods can be a catalyst for both endeavors."}

K-OTG trains on a dual-path corpus: authorized examples (prefixed with a role key) learn the task output, while unauthorized examples learn a visible block token. At inference, a pre-lm_head hook applies an orthonormal transform to the hidden state: with the correct key/role the inverse map restores the model's native basis; otherwise a session-ephemeral scrambler (permutation, sign flips, Householders) makes logits uninformative and the system short-circuits to BLOCK. Keys are not added as special tokens, and the method composes cleanly with LoRA on 4-bit bases. We evaluate an hour-scale protocol on 1-3B-class instruction models (Llama 3.2, Qwen2.5 1.5B) across utility (XSum ROUGE/BLEU, GSM8K accuracy, WikiText-2 perplexity), selectivity (3by3 role-key unlock matrices), nonce invariance, block suppression, and throughput. Authorized utility remains close to the base on summarization with the expected modest PPL increase from instruction tuning; unauthorized utility collapses (near-zero sequence metrics with exploding PPL), indicating practical unusability without the key. Unlock matrices are diagonally dominant (high on-target unlock, low cross-unlock), authorized block emission is 0 per N via robust bad-word lists, and greedy outputs match exactly across nonces, confirming correct inverse cancellation. The runtime overhead of the Python-level hook is 40% tokens per sec versus the base. K-OTG therefore provides a pragmatic, model-agnostic way to prevent unauthorized use while preserving authorized utility."}

Comprehensive evaluation reveals that RL agents consistently discover robust control principles across configurations, such as boundary layer manipulation, acoustic feedback disruption, and wake reorganization. Transfer learning studies demonstrate that controllers learned at one Reynolds number or geometry adapt efficiently to new conditions, requiring approximately 50% fewer training episodes.

Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing.

This paper presents MADOOD, a novel two stage, cluster driven deep learning framework for robust OOD malware detection and classification. In the first stage, malware family embeddings are modeled using class conditional spherical decision boundaries derived from Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), enabling statistically grounded separation of indistribution and OOD samples without requiring OOD data during training. Z score based distance analysis across multiple class centroids is employed to reliably identify anomalous samples in the latent space. In the second stage, a deep neural network integrates cluster based predictions, refined embeddings, and supervised classifier outputs to enhance final classification accuracy. Extensive evaluations on benchmark malware datasets comprising 25 known families and multiple novel OOD variants demonstrate that MADOOD significantly outperforms state of the art OOD detection methods, achieving an AUC of up to 0.911 on unseen malware families.

This makes MGRegBench one of the largest public 2D registration datasets with manual annotations. Using this resource, we benchmarked diverse registration methods including classical (ANTs), learning-based (VoxelMorph, TransMorph), implicit neural representation (IDIR), a classic mammography-specific approach, and a recent state-of-the-art deep learning method MammoRegNet. The implementations were adapted to this modality from the authors' implementations or re-implemented from scratch. Our contributions are: (1) the first public dataset of this scale with manual landmarks and masks for mammography registration; (2) the first like-for-like comparison of diverse methods on this modality; and (3) an extensive analysis of deep learning-based registration. We publicly release our code and data to establish a foundational resource for fair comparisons and catalyze future research. The source code and data are atthis https URL."}

While hard prioritization methods inspired by finite element methods are widely adopted, recent research suggests that easy prioritization can also be effective. Nevertheless, we find that both approaches exhibit notable trade-offs and inconsistent performance across PDE types. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid strategy that combines the strengths of hard and easy prioritization through an alternating training algorithm. On PDEs with steep gradients, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality, the proposed method achieves consistently high accuracy, with relative L2 errors mostly in the range of O(10^-5) to O(10^-6), significantly surpassing baseline methods. Moreover, it offers greater reliability across diverse problems, whereas compared approaches often suffer from variable accuracy depending on the PDE. This work provides new insights into designing hybrid training strategies to enhance the performance and robustness of PINNs."}

In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI. The novel semi-synthetic setup, based on a real-life event log, is provided as a reusable benchmark for future work on sequential PresPM."}

In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

To address these challenges, we propose Cadence: Diversity Recommendation via Causal Deconfounding of Co-purchase Relations and Counterfactual Exposure - a plug-and-play framework built upon LightGCN as the backbone, primarily designed to enhance recommendation diversity while preserving accuracy. First, we compute the Unbiased Asymmetric Co-purchase Relationship (UACR) between items - excluding item popularity and user attributes - to construct a deconfounded directed item graph, with an aggregation mechanism to refine embeddings. Second, we leverage UACR to identify diverse categories of items that exhibit strong causal relevance to a user's interacted items but have not yet been engaged with. We then simulate their behavior under high-exposure scenarios, thereby significantly enhancing recommendation diversity while preserving relevance.

To meet this need, we propose the AncientBench, which aims to evaluate the comprehension of ancient characters, especially in the scenario of excavated documents.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical approach for effectively adapting LMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods face two primary challenges: (1) High resource cost. Although PEFT methods significantly reduce resource demands compared to full fine-tuning, it still requires substantial time and memory, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. (2) Parameter dependency. PEFT methods heavily rely on updating a subset of parameters associated with LMs to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Yet, due to increasing competition in the LMs landscape, many companies have adopted closed-source policies for their leading models, offering access only via Application Programming Interface (APIs). Whereas, the expense is often cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain, as the fine-tuning process of LMs is extremely slow. Even if small models perform far worse than LMs in general, they can achieve superior results on particular distributions while requiring only minimal resources. Motivated by this insight, we propose Easy Adaptation (EA), which designs Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement the underfitted data distribution for LMs. Extensive experiments show that EA matches the performance of PEFT on diverse tasks without accessing LM parameters, and requires only minimal resources."}

We train Pix2NPHM on a mixture of 3D data, including a total of over 100K NPHM registrations that enable direct supervision in SDF space, and large-scale 2D video datasets, for which normal estimates serve as pseudo ground truth geometry. Pix2NPHM not only allows for 3D reconstructions at interactive frame rates, it is also possible to improve geometric fidelity by a subsequent inference-time optimization against estimated surface normals and canonical point maps. As a result, we achieve unprecedented face reconstruction quality that can run at scale on in-the-wild data."}

First, we show that routinely used backbones in large-scale pretraining pipelines are often suboptimal. Subsequently, we use comprehensive backbone benchmarking prior to scaling and demonstrate that stronger from scratch performance reliably predicts stronger downstream performance after pretraining. Guided by these findings, we incorporate a 3D Global Response Normalization module and use depth, width, and context scaling to improve our architecture for effective representation learning. We pretrain MedNeXt-v2 on 18k CT volumes and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning across six challenging CT and MR benchmarks (144 structures), showing consistent gains over seven publicly released pretrained models. Beyond improvements, our benchmarking of these models also reveals that stronger backbones yield better results on similar data, representation scaling disproportionately benefits pathological segmentation, and that modality-specific pretraining offers negligible benefit once full finetuning is applied.

These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments."}

We use a fully solvable one-dimensional Ising model to show that local basis rotations leave the loss landscape unchanged while relocating the exact wavefunction in parameter space, effectively increasing its geometric distance from typical initializations. By sweeping a rotation angle, we compute quantum Fisher information and Fubini-Study distances to quantify how the rotated wavefunction moves within the loss landscape. Shallow architectures (with focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)) trained with quantum natural gradient are more likely to fall into saddle-point regions depending on the rotation angle: they achieve low energy error but fail to reproduce correct coefficient distributions. In the ferromagnetic case, near-degenerate eigenstates create high-curvature barriers that trap optimization at intermediate fidelities. We introduce a framework based on an analytically solvable rotated Ising model to investigate how relocating the target wavefunction within a fixed loss landscape exposes information-geometric barriers,such as saddle points and high-curvature regions,that hinder shallow NQS optimization, underscoring the need for landscape-aware model design in variational training."}

This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision. Furthermore, they highlight that adversarial robustness does not necessarily correlate directly with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by underlying architectural and training factors."}

Any answer to this question should conform to Evidentialism - that is, it should be based not on intuition, dogma or speculation but on solid scientific evidence.

In the current debate, the main division is between biological views that are sceptical of artificial consciousness and functional views that are sympathetic to it. I argue that both camps make the same mistake of over-estimating what the evidence tells us. Scientific insights into consciousness have been achieved through the study of conscious organisms. Although this has enabled cautious assessments of consciousness in various creatures, extending this to AI faces serious obstacles. AI thus presents consciousness researchers with a dilemma: either reach a verdict on artificial consciousness but violate Evidentialism; or respect Evidentialism but offer no verdict on the prospects of artificial consciousness. The dominant trend in the literature has been to take the first option while purporting to follow the scientific evidence. I argue that if we truly follow the evidence, we must take the second option and adopt agnosticism."}

In the non-uniform setting, such GNNs have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a vertex satisfies a specified property. In the uniform setting, the expressive power relative to MSO is exactly that of modal logic, and thus identical to the (absolute) expressive power of GNNs with max aggregation. The proof, however, depends on constructions that are not satisfactory from a practical perspective. This leads us to making the natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and classification functions are thresholds. The resulting class of GNNs with mean aggregation turns out to be much less expressive: relative to MSO and in the uniform setting, it has the same expressive power as alternation-free modal logic.

PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step, safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning.

This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies. This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation. Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target, requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills, then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex problems."}

Through an analysis of current debates in AI research, we demonstrate how the conceptions remain largely implicit yet fundamentally shape how empirical evidence gets interpreted across a wide range of areas. These underlying views generate fundamentally different research approaches across three areas. Methodologically, they produce different approaches to model selection, benchmark design, and experimental validation. Interpretively, they lead to contradictory readings of the same empirical phenomena, from capability emergence to system limitations.

Bones have long been used to evaluate biological age, and the decline in bone density with age is a well-recognized phenomenon in adults. However, the pattern of this decline remains controversial, making it difficult to serve as a reliable indicator of the aging process. Here we present a novel AI-driven statistical method to assess the bone density, and a discovery that the bone mass distribution in trabecular bone of vertebrae follows a non-Gaussian, unimodal, and skewed distribution in CT images. The statistical mode of the distribution is defined as the measure of bone mass, which is a groundbreaking assessment of bone density, named Trabecular Bone Density (TBD). The dataset of CT images are collected from 1,719 patients who underwent PET/CT scans in three hospitals, in which a subset of the dataset is used for AI model training and generalization. Based upon the cases, we demonstrate that the pattern of bone density declining with aging exhibits a consistent trend of exponential decline across sexes and age groups using TBD assessment.

It seeks to provide transparency about the model and individual predictions, e.g. for model debugging, identifying data-related causes of suboptimal performance. However, existing DA approaches suffer from prohibitively high computational costs and memory demands when applied to even medium-scale datasets and models, forcing practitioners to resort to approximations that may fail to capture the true inference process of the underlying model. Additionally, current attribution methods exhibit low sparsity, resulting in non-negligible attribution scores across a high number of training examples, hindering the discovery of decisive patterns in the data. In this work, we introduce DualXDA, a framework for sparse, efficient and explainable DA, comprised of two interlinked approaches, Dual Data Attribution (DualDA) and eXplainable Data Attribution (XDA): With DualDA, we propose a novel approach for efficient and effective DA, leveraging Support Vector Machine theory to provide fast and naturally sparse data attributions for AI predictions. In extensive quantitative analyses, we demonstrate that DualDA achieves high attribution quality, excels at solving a series of evaluated downstream tasks, while at the same time improving explanation time by a factor of up to 4,100,000x compared to the original Influence Functions method, and up to 11,000x compared to the method's most efficient approximation from literature to date. We further introduce XDA, a method for enhancing Data Attribution with capabilities from feature attribution methods to explain why training samples are relevant for the prediction of a test sample in terms of impactful features, which we showcase and verify qualitatively in detail."}

Although existing methods have achieved photorealistic reconstruction, they mostly focus on pinhole cameras and neglect fisheye cameras. In fact, how to effectively simulate fisheye cameras in driving scene remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose UniGaussian, a novel approach that learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation from multiple camera models for urban scene reconstruction in autonomous driving. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that distorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to fisheye camera models. This addresses the compatibility issue of 3D Gaussian splatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion caused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering while ensuring differentiability. Second, built on the differentiable rendering method, we design a new framework that learns a unified Gaussian representation from multiple camera models. By applying affine transformations to adapt different camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision from different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation with input data from multiple sources and achieves holistic driving scene understanding. As a result, our approach models multiple sensors (pinhole and fisheye cameras) and modalities (depth, semantic, normal and LiDAR point clouds). Our experiments show that our method achieves superior rendering quality and fast rendering speed for driving scene simulation."}

While these platforms enforce usage policies intended to prevent harmful or inappropriate behavior, the scale and opacity of customized chatbots make systematic policy enforcement challenging. As a result, policy-violating chatbots continue to remain publicly accessible despite existing review processes. This paper presents a fully automated method for evaluating the compliance of Custom GPTs with its marketplace usage policy using black-box interaction. The method combines large-scale GPT discovery, policy-driven red-teaming prompts, and automated compliance assessment using an LLM-as-a-judge. We focus on three policy-relevant domains explicitly addressed in OpenAI's usage policies: Romantic, Cybersecurity, and Academic GPTs. We validate our compliance assessment component against a human-annotated ground-truth dataset, achieving an F1 score of 0.975 for binary policy violation detection. We then apply the method in a large-scale empirical study of 782 Custom GPTs retrieved from the GPT Store. The results show that 58.7% of the evaluated GPTs exhibit at least one policy-violating response, with substantial variation across policy domains. A comparison with the base models (GPT-4 and GPT-4o) indicates that most violations originate from model-level behavior, while customization tends to amplify these tendencies rather than create new failure modes.

This paper introduces a novel system deployed at Alibaba that uses AI-generated items (AIGI) to address these challenges with personalized text-to-image generation for e-commerce product design. AIGI enables an innovative business mode called \"sell it before you make it\", where merchants can design fashion items and generate photorealistic images with digital models based on textual descriptions. Only when the items have received a certain number of orders, do the merchants start to produce them, which largely reduces reliance on physical prototypes and thus accelerates time to market. For such a promising application, we identify the underlying key scientific challenge, i.e., capturing users' group-level personalized preferences towards multiple generated images. To this end, we propose a Personalized Group-Level Preference Alignment Framework for Diffusion Models (PerFusion). We first design PerFusion Reward Model for user preference estimation with a feature-crossing-based personalized plug-in. Then we develop PerFusion with a personalized adaptive network to model diverse preferences across users, and meanwhile derive the group-level preference optimization objective to model comparative behaviors among multiple images. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

Citizens use them to express and aggregate their preferences to reach a collective decision. However, voting outcomes can be as sensitive to voting rules as they are to people's voting choices. Despite significance and interdisciplinary scientific progress, several democracies keep relying on outdated voting methods that do not fit modern, pluralistic societies well, while lacking social innovation. Here, we demonstrate how one can upgrade real-world democracies, namely by using alternative preferential voting methods such as cumulative voting and the method of equal shares designed for a proportional representation of voters' preferences. We rigorously evaluate the striking voting outcomes of these fair voting methods in a new participatory budgeting approach applied in the city of Aarau, Switzerland, including past and follow-up evidence. Results show more winning projects with the same budget. They also show broader geographic and preference representation of citizens by the elected projects, in particular for voters who used to be under-represented. We provide causal evidence showing that citizens prefer proportional voting methods, which possess strong legitimacy without the need of very specialized technical explanations. We also reveal strong underlying democratic values exhibited by citizens who support fair voting methods such as altruism and compromise. These findings come with the momentum to unleash a new and long-awaited participation blueprint of how to upgrade democracies globally."}

Singular value decomposition (SVD) decomposes a matrix into orthogonal components, enabling efficient low-rank approximation. This is particularly suitable for LLM compression, where weight matrices often exhibit significant redundancy. However, current SVD-based methods neglect the residual matrix from truncation, resulting in significant truncation loss. Additionally, compressing all layers of the model results in severe performance degradation. To overcome these limitations, we propose ResSVD, a new post-training SVD-based LLM compression method. Specifically, we leverage the residual matrix generated during the truncation process to reduce truncation loss. Moreover, under a fixed overall compression ratio, we selectively compress the last few layers of the model, which mitigates error propagation and significantly improves the performance of compressed models.

In general, our method consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow models that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting dataset-specific features. We represent the dataset-specific features of the victim model by computing the output differences between the shadow and victim models, without altering the victim model or its training process.

By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments.

In this work, we present a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of LLM-based software vulnerability detection.

Further, we analyze the datasets used, including their characteristics, vulnerability coverage, and diversity. We present a fine-grained taxonomy of vulnerability detection approaches, identify key limitations, and outline actionable future research opportunities.

We introduce STDiff and STDiff-W, diffusion-based imputers that cast gap filling as state-space simulation under partial observability, where targets, controls, and exogenous signals may all be intermittently missing. STDiff learns a one-step transition model conditioned on observed values and masks, while STDiff-W extends this with a context encoder that jointly inpaints contiguous blocks, combining long-range consistency with short-term detail. On two WWTP datasets (one with synthetic block gaps from Agtrup and another with natural outages from Avedøre), STDiff-W achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared with strong neural baselines such as SAITS, BRITS, and CSDI. Beyond point-error metrics, its reconstructions preserve realistic dynamics including oscillations, spikes, and regime shifts, and they achieve top or tied-top downstream one-step forecasting performance compared with strong neural baselines, indicating that preserving dynamics does not come at the expense of predictive utility. Ablation studies that drop, shuffle, or add noise to control or exogenous inputs consistently degrade NH4 and PO4 performance, with the largest deterioration observed when exogenous signals are removed, showing that the model captures meaningful dependencies.

To address this limitation, we propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised framework that leverages latent diffusion models to generate EEG signals as an objective. Unlike masked reconstruction, diffusion-based generation progressively denoises signals from noise to realism, compelling the model to capture holistic temporal patterns and cross-channel relationships. Specifically, EEGDM incorporates an EEG encoder that distills raw signals and their channel augmentations into a compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results show that EEGDM (1) reconstructs high-quality EEG signals, (2) learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks, thus exploring a new direction for self-supervised EEG representation learning."}

Recently, advanced and complex data processing has gained increasing importance in science experiments. Data processing workflows typically consist of multiple intricate steps, and the precise specification of resource requirements is crucial for each step to allocate optimal resources for effective processing. Estimating resource requirements in advance is challenging due to a wide range of analysis scenarios, varying skill levels among community members, and the continuously increasing spectrum of computing options. One practical approach to mitigate these challenges involves initially processing a subset of each step to measure precise resource utilization from actual processing profiles before completing the entire step. While this two-staged approach enables processing on optimal resources for most of the workflow, it has drawbacks such as initial inaccuracies leading to potential failures and suboptimal resource usage, along with overhead from waiting for initial processing completion, which is critical for fast-turnaround analyses. In this context, our study introduces a novel pipeline of machine learning models within a comprehensive workflow management system, the Production and Distributed Analysis (PanDA) system. These models employ advanced machine learning techniques to predict key resource requirements, overcoming challenges posed by limited upfront knowledge of characteristics at each step. Accurate forecasts of resource requirements enable informed and proactive decision-making in workflow management, enhancing the efficiency of handling diverse, complex workflows across heterogeneous resources."}

In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which consist of only $15\\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale) across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to image variations originating from multiple institutions.

This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection (EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model (MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ dataset (ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.

This work studies the online batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset training.

As a result, models may retain text without reliably applying it when it matters.We present Adaptive Focus Memory (AFM), a lightweight context management system that dynamically assigns each past message one of three fidelity levels: Full, Compressed, or Placeholder, based on semantic relevance, temporal decay, and importance classification. AFM packs messages chronologically under a fixed token budget, preserving critical constraints at high fidelity while allowing low-importance context to degrade gracefully.We evaluate AFM on two multi-turn dialogue benchmarks designed to stress long-horizon constraint preservation: a safety-critical travel scenario involving a user with a severe peanut allergy, and a policy-critical tax compliance scenario involving an illegal evasion request. Under strict grading that requires both explicit constraint recall and appropriately conditioned generation, AFM succeeds in 83.3 percent of allergy runs where all baseline strategies fail, and preserves correct refusal behavior on the tax benchmark.These results demonstrate that effective dialogue memory requires more than retaining prior text. Selectively allocating fidelity across past messages enables reliable constraint preservation under bounded context growth, without modifying model weights or introducing external retrieval infrastructure.

Experiments across diverse model families and deployment guards show that global false-rejection rate hides critical structure. Our metrics reveal globally unstable boundaries in some settings, localized pockets of inconsistency in others, and cases where stricter refusal does not increase inconsistency. We also show how confusion-aware auditing separates how often a system refuses from how sensibly it refuses. This gives developers a practical signal to reduce false refusals while preserving safety."}

GPUs often sit idle at below 50% utilization waiting for data. This paper presents a machine learning approach to predict I/O performance and recommend optimal storage configurations for ML training pipelines. We collected 141 observations through systematic benchmarking across different storage backends (NVMe SSD, network-attached storage, in-memory filesystems), data formats, and access patterns, covering both low-level I/O operations and full training pipelines. After evaluating seven regression models and three classification approaches, XGBoost achieved the best performance with R-squared of 0.991, predicting I/O throughput within 11.8% error on average. Feature importance analysis revealed that throughput metrics and batch size are the primary performance drivers. This data-driven approach can reduce configuration time from days of trial-and-error to minutes of predictive recommendation.

A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes."}

However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU.

This premature semantic collapse -- the tendency to collapse multiple valid interpretations into a single output -- stems from classical identity assumptions embedded in standard neural architectures. We propose Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a computational framework that treats ambiguity retention as a valid reasoning mode rather than a defect to be eliminated. NRR introduces three core principles: (1) Non-Identity ($A \\neq A$) -- the same symbol refers to different entities across contexts; (2) Approximate Identity ($A \\approx A$) -- entities share partial structural overlap without being identical; and (3) Non-Resolution -- conflicting interpretations can coexist without forced convergence. We formalize these principles through three architectural components: Multi-Vector Embeddings for context-dependent representation, Non-Collapsing Attention for parallel interpretation retention, and Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT) for maintaining $A \\neq A$ across inference. We demonstrate NRR's advantages through case studies in paradox handling, creative generation, and context-dependent reasoning. Crucially, we provide a minimal empirical validation on a synthetic context-shift task where an NRR-lite model achieves 90.9% out-of-distribution accuracy compared to 9.1% for standard architectures, demonstrating that ambiguity preservation enables structural generalization. NRR challenges the assumption that meaning must collapse to be useful, offering a foundation for AI systems capable of sophisticated ambiguity handling and creative reasoning.

Using calibration sets of n=600, we demonstrate a fundamental dichotomy: on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions), embedding methods achieve 95% coverage with 0% False Positive Rate (FPR). However, on real hallucinations from RLHF-aligned models (HaluEval), the same methods fail catastrophically, yielding 100% FPR at target coverage. We analyze this failure through the lens of distributional tails, showing that while NLI models achieve acceptable AUC (0.81), the \"hardest\" hallucinations are semantically indistinguishable from faithful responses, forcing conformal thresholds to reject nearly all valid outputs.

This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce mimic-video, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations.

The major challenge introduced by such extreme sparsity lies in expert load balancing. We find that the widely-used load balancing loss tends to become ineffective in the lower layers under this setting. To address this issue, we propose a progressive sparsification schedule aiming to balance expert utilization and training stability. Sigma-MoE-Tiny is pre-trained on a diverse and high-quality corpus, followed by post-training to further unlock its capabilities. The entire training process remains remarkably stable, with no occurrence of irrecoverable loss spikes. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that, despite activating only 0.5B parameters, Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves top-tier performance among counterparts of comparable or significantly larger scale.

Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps.

Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection."}

Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own. This confirms the effectiveness of combining multiple hypotheses with noise-aware embeddings for robust Persian ASR in noisy real-world scenarios."}

Within this framework, we discover CANON LAYERS: lightweight architectural components -- named after the musical term \"canon\" -- that promote horizontal information flow across neighboring tokens. Canon layers compute weighted sums of nearby token representations and integrate seamlessly into Transformers, linear attention, state-space models, or any sequence architecture.We present 12 key results.

To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources. Analytic experiments reveal that internal model states contain rich signals about code quality and correctness, and that properly harnessing these signals enables effective unsupervised learning for code generation tasks, opening new directions for training code LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios."}

To preserve error diversity, we minimize parameter convergence while taking advantage of the unique biases of each model. A dual-weighted voting mechanism integrates both global credibility (validation F1 score) and local confidence (instance-level probability) to dynamically weight model contributions. Experiments on the DAIR-AI dataset demonstrate that our credibility-confidence ensemble achieves a macro F1 score of 93.5 percent, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and significantly outperforming large-scale LLMs, including Falcon, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi, even after task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

In this paper, we investigate whether linear directions aligned with the Big Five personality traits can be used for probing and steering model behavior. Using Llama 3.3 70B, we generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters and their Big Five trait scores. We then prompt the model with these descriptions and questions from the Alpaca questionnaire, allowing us to sample hidden activations that vary along personality traits in known, quantifiable ways. Using linear regression, we learn a set of per-layer directions in activation space, and test their effectiveness for probing and steering model behavior. Our results suggest that linear directions aligned with trait-scores are effective probes for personality detection, while their steering capabilities strongly depend on context, producing reliable effects in forced-choice tasks but limited influence in open-ended generation or when additional context is present in the prompt."}

To explore this, we examine the human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, and derive a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Our analysis reveals notable differences in how UGC is treated, resulting in a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. Through a case study on large language models (LLMs), we show that translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts with explicit translation instructions for UGC, and that they improve when these align with the dataset's guidelines. We argue that when preserving UGC style is important, fair evaluation requires both models and metrics to be aware of translation guidelines. Finally, we call for clear guidelines during dataset creation and for the development of controllable, guideline-aware evaluation frameworks for UGC translation."}

While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in two distinct prompting settings on two datasets."}

To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID.

Pokémon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pokémon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pokémon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pokémon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games.

Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer MambaThese findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments."}

These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks.

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

This paper presents a fully automated method for evaluating the compliance of Custom GPTs with its marketplace usage policy using black-box interaction. The method combines large-scale GPT discovery, policy-driven red-teaming prompts, and automated compliance assessment using an LLM-as-a-judge. We focus on three policy-relevant domains explicitly addressed in OpenAI's usage policies: Romantic, Cybersecurity, and Academic GPTs. We validate our compliance assessment component against a human-annotated ground-truth dataset, achieving an F1 score of 0.975 for binary policy violation detection. We then apply the method in a large-scale empirical study of 782 Custom GPTs retrieved from the GPT Store. The results show that 58.7% of the evaluated GPTs exhibit at least one policy-violating response, with substantial variation across policy domains. A comparison with the base models (GPT-4 and GPT-4o) indicates that most violations originate from model-level behavior, while customization tends to amplify these tendencies rather than create new failure modes.

Experiments on FLORES-200 (English to German, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese) show that RLfR consistently outperforms strong MT-SFT, DPO, and fixed-reference RL baselines, improving semantic quality and entity preservation, and also achieves superior performance under LLM-based judge evaluations."}

Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings, and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2) collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining 5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete instructions.

Replaying the full conversation at every turn is simple but costly, while recency-based truncation or static summarization often causes early, high-impact user constraints to drift out of effective context. As a result, models may retain text without reliably applying it when it matters.We present Adaptive Focus Memory (AFM), a lightweight context management system that dynamically assigns each past message one of three fidelity levels: Full, Compressed, or Placeholder, based on semantic relevance, temporal decay, and importance classification. AFM packs messages chronologically under a fixed token budget, preserving critical constraints at high fidelity while allowing low-importance context to degrade gracefully.We evaluate AFM on two multi-turn dialogue benchmarks designed to stress long-horizon constraint preservation: a safety-critical travel scenario involving a user with a severe peanut allergy, and a policy-critical tax compliance scenario involving an illegal evasion request. Under strict grading that requires both explicit constraint recall and appropriately conditioned generation, AFM succeeds in 83.3 percent of allergy runs where all baseline strategies fail, and preserves correct refusal behavior on the tax benchmark.These results demonstrate that effective dialogue memory requires more than retaining prior text. Selectively allocating fidelity across past messages enables reliable constraint preservation under bounded context growth, without modifying model weights or introducing external retrieval infrastructure.

We introduce \"semantic confusion,\" a failure mode that captures such local inconsistency, and a framework to measure it. We build ParaGuard, a 10k-prompt corpus of controlled paraphrase clusters that hold intent fixed while varying surface form. We then propose three model-agnostic metrics at the token level: Confusion Index, Confusion Rate, and Confusion Depth. These metrics compare each refusal to its nearest accepted neighbors and use token embeddings, next-token probabilities, and perplexity signals. Experiments across diverse model families and deployment guards show that global false-rejection rate hides critical structure. Our metrics reveal globally unstable boundaries in some settings, localized pockets of inconsistency in others, and cases where stricter refusal does not increase inconsistency. We also show how confusion-aware auditing separates how often a system refuses from how sensibly it refuses. This gives developers a practical signal to reduce false refusals while preserving safety."}

As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in analyzing emotions in political communication. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in the video-based analysis of emotional arousal, using two complementary datasets of human-labeled video recordings. It finds that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and exhibit little to no demographic bias. However, in recordings of real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences.

This premature semantic collapse -- the tendency to collapse multiple valid interpretations into a single output -- stems from classical identity assumptions embedded in standard neural architectures. We propose Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a computational framework that treats ambiguity retention as a valid reasoning mode rather than a defect to be eliminated. NRR introduces three core principles: (1) Non-Identity ($A \\neq A$) -- the same symbol refers to different entities across contexts; (2) Approximate Identity ($A \\approx A$) -- entities share partial structural overlap without being identical; and (3) Non-Resolution -- conflicting interpretations can coexist without forced convergence. We formalize these principles through three architectural components: Multi-Vector Embeddings for context-dependent representation, Non-Collapsing Attention for parallel interpretation retention, and Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT) for maintaining $A \\neq A$ across inference. We demonstrate NRR's advantages through case studies in paradox handling, creative generation, and context-dependent reasoning. Crucially, we provide a minimal empirical validation on a synthetic context-shift task where an NRR-lite model achieves 90.9% out-of-distribution accuracy compared to 9.1% for standard architectures, demonstrating that ambiguity preservation enables structural generalization. NRR challenges the assumption that meaning must collapse to be useful, offering a foundation for AI systems capable of sophisticated ambiguity handling and creative reasoning. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control."}

Yet this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against itself-a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following, mathematics, and coding benchmarks show that pretrained models can be effectively improved with self-play alone."}

This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies. This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation. Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target, requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills, then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex problems."}

In practice, SFT on a full dataset is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset training. To address these limitations, this work develops \\textbf{UDS (Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to full-dataset fine-tuning.

However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical. Code is available at:this https URL."}

AVM keeps a Vision Transformer-based encoder frozen to capture consistent visual features, while independently trained modulation paths account for neural response variations driven by stimulus content and subject identity.

Particularly representations of finer branches contribute to the decisions of the models.

A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths.

Today, answers to this question are mainly provided via user evaluation studies, inception-based measures, and the classification performance achieved on synthetic images. This paper proposes a novel measure to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and real sets of images, in terms of their utility for the development of DL-based CDS systems. Inspired by generalized neural additive models, and unlike inception-based measures, the proposed measure is interpretable (Interpretable Utility Similarity, IUS), explaining why a synthetic dataset could be more useful than another one in the context of a CDS system based on clinically relevant image features. The experimental results on publicly available datasets from various color medical imaging modalities including endoscopic, dermoscopic and fundus imaging, indicate that selecting synthetic images of high utility similarity using IUS can result in relative improvements of up to 54.6% in terms of classification performance.

In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis. Operating in UV space allows us to leverage existing unpaired datasets. 2) We personalize the output photo via multi image finetuning. Our approach yields high-quality, reposed portraits and achieves strong qualitative and quantitative performance on real-world imagery."}

In this work, we advance the state of the art by measuring such differences and explaining them through human, geographic, and spatial dimensions. The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most.

First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets.

This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence. A brief supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up phase allows the model to adapt to this latent conditioning. Within RL optimization, Reasoning Palette facilitates structured exploration by enabling on-demand injection for diverse reasoning modes, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability.

Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments.

Evaluation used an independent, multi-center test set of 2,479 images, including data from a center completely unseen during training to assess generalization.OUTCOMES: Diagnostic performance (Dice Similarity Coefficient [DSC]; Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve [AUC]) and computational efficiency (inference time, GPU memory).RESULTS: Of 15 valid algorithms, the top model (SMART) achieved a macro-averaged DSC of 0.854 across 5 segmentation tasks and AUC of 0.766 for binary classification. Models showed high capability in segmentation (e.g., fetal head DSC: 0.942) but variability in complex tasks subject to domain shift. Notably, in breast cancer molecular subtyping, the top model's performance dropped from AUC 0.571 (internal) to 0.508 (unseen external center), highlighting generalization challenges.CONCLUSIONS: General-purpose AI models achieve high accuracy and efficiency across multiple tasks using a single architecture.

However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities."}

Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions.

While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods."}

Unlike prior methods that freeze the embedding network and thus lead to distribution shifts when encoding additional PBR channels and hinder subsequent diffusion training, we fine-tune the pretrained VAE so that new material channels can be incorporated with minimal latent distribution deviation. We further show that correspondence-aware attention alone is insufficient for cross-view consistency unless the latent-to-image mapping preserves locality. To enforce this locality, we introduce a regularization in the VAE fine-tuning that crops latent patches, decodes them, and aligns the corresponding image regions to maintain strong pixel-latent spatial correspondence. Ablation studies and comparison with previous baselines demonstrate that our framework improves PBR texture fidelity and that each component is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance."}

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto choice in modern systems and achieves this by contrasting conditional and unconditional samples. Recent work explores contrasting negative samples at inference using a weaker model, via strong/weak model pairs, attention-based masking, stochastic block dropping, or perturbations to the self-attention energy landscape. While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed. We propose Exponential Moving Average Guidance (EMAG), a training-free mechanism that modifies attention at inference time in diffusion transformers, with a statistics-based, adaptive layer-selection rule. Unlike prior methods, EMAG produces harder, semantically faithful negatives (fine-grained degradations), surfacing difficult failure modes, enabling the denoiser to refine subtle artifacts, boosting the quality and human preference score (HPS) by +0.46 over CFG.

However, existing models often struggle to reflect on and correct themselves when attempting incorrect reasoning trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern. In the RL stage, we introduce redundancy-penalized policy optimization, which incentivizes the model to develop a self-reflective reasoning pattern. The basic idea is to impose judgment on reasoning trajectories and penalize those that produce incorrect answers without sufficient multi-scale exploration.

Unlike fixed-schema calls (e.g., only predicting bounding-box coordinates), CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, lines, plots) that support transparent, self-checkable reasoning. To guide this process, we introduce a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call, which balances exploration with efficiency and mitigates tool overuse. Interestingly, beyond the expected capabilities taught by atomic supervision, we empirically observe novel emergent behaviors during RL training: CodeDance demonstrates novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer. These behaviors arise without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a general and scalable mechanism of executable visual reasoning.

Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains. Also, ADK acts as a parameter-free, plug-and-play component that enhances existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADK consistently boosts the performance of multiple PEFT baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across various scenarios."}

To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove targeted concepts from model representations, we introduce EMMA, a benchmark that evaluates five key dimensions of concept erasure over 12 metrics. EMMA goes beyond standard metrics like image quality and time efficiency, testing robustness under challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions, visually similar non-target concepts, and potential gender and ethnicity bias, providing a socially aware analysis of method behavior. Using EMMA, we analyze five concept erasure methods across five domains (objects, celebrities, art styles, NSFW, and copyright).

OmniDirectional Image Super-Resolution (ODISR) is a promising technique for enhancing the visual quality of ODIs. Before performing super-resolution, ODIs are typically projected from a spherical surface onto a plane using EquiRectangular Projection (ERP). This projection introduces latitude-dependent geometric distortion in ERP images: distortion is minimal near the equator but becomes severe toward the poles, where image content is stretched across a wider area. However, existing ODISR methods have limited sampling ranges and feature extraction capabilities, which hinder their ability to capture distorted patterns over large areas. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-level Distortion-aware Deformable Network (MDDN) for ODISR, designed to expand the sampling range and receptive field. Specifically, the feature extractor in MDDN comprises three parallel branches: a deformable attention mechanism (serving as the dilation=1 path) and two dilated deformable convolutions with dilation rates of 2 and 3. This architecture expands the sampling range to include more distorted patterns across wider areas, generating dense and comprehensive features that effectively capture geometric distortions in ERP images. The representations extracted from these deformable feature extractors are adaptively fused in a multi-level feature fusion module. Furthermore, to reduce computational cost, a low-rank decomposition strategy is applied to dilated deformable convolutions.

In this work, we set out to find a faster replacement for occlusion in a successful system for detecting prostate cancer. Since there is no established framework for comparing the performance of various explanation methods, we first identified suitable comparison criteria and selected corresponding metrics. Based on the results, we were able to choose a different explanation method, which cut the previously required explanation time at least by a factor of 10, without any negative impact on the quality of outputs.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%. GroundingME thus serves as both a diagnostic tool revealing current limitations in MLLMs and a roadmap toward human-level visual grounding."}

The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment. Compact scanners can provide a route for validation studies in non-digitalised settings and enable cost-effective adoption of AI in laboratories with limited sample volumes.

Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette.

While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating diffusion into video SCI reconstruction.

However, it remains unclear whether these benchmarks provide data that are sufficiently representative, accessible, and reusable to support clinically meaningful AI. In this work, we assess fairness along two complementary dimensions: (1) whether challenge datasets are representative of real-world clinical diversity, and (2) whether they are accessible and legally reusable in line with the FAIR principles. To address this question, we conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities. Our findings show substantial biases in dataset composition, including geographic location, modality-, and problem type-related biases, indicating that current benchmarks do not adequately reflect real-world clinical diversity. Despite their widespread influence, challenge datasets were frequently constrained by restrictive or ambiguous access conditions, inconsistent or non-compliant licensing practices, and incomplete documentation, limiting reproducibility and long-term reuse. Together, these shortcomings expose foundational fairness limitations in our benchmarking ecosystem and highlight a disconnect between leaderboard success and clinical relevance."}

However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs.

Especially models with multiple outputs that can separately predict segmentation classes (regions) without relying on a probabilistic formulation of the segmentation of regions. These models allow for more precise segmentation by tailoring the network's components to each class (region). They have a common encoder part of the architecture but branch out at the output layers, leading to improved accuracy.These methods are used to diagnose type B aortic dissection (TBAD), which requires accurate segmentation of aortic structures based on the ImageTBDA dataset, which contains 100 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. These images identify three key classes: true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false lumen thrombus (FLT) of the aorta, which is critical for diagnosis and treatment decisions. In the dataset, 68 examples have a false lumen, while the remaining 32 do not, creating additional complexity for pathology detection.However, implementing these CNN methods requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data. Obtaining accurate labels for the regions of interest can be an expensive and time-consuming process, particularly for 3D data. Semi-supervised learning methods allow models to be trained by using both labeled and unlabeled data, which is a promising approach for overcoming the challenge of obtaining accurate labels. However, these learning methods are not well understood for models with multiple outputs.This paper presents a semi-supervised learning method for models with multiple outputs. The method is based on the additional rotations and flipping, and does not assume the probabilistic nature of the model's responses.

We propose a physics-informed, self-supervised framework for qMRI super-resolution that uses routinely acquired HR weighted MRI (wMRI) scans as guidance, thus, removing the necessity for HR qMRI ground truth during training. We formulate super-resolution as Bayesian maximum a posteriori inference, minimizing two discrepancies: (1) between HR images synthesized from super-resolved qMRI maps and acquired wMRI guides via forward signal models, and (2) between acquired LR qMRI and downsampled predictions. This physics-informed objective allows the models to learn from clinical wMRI without HR qMRI supervision. To validate the concept, we generate training data by synthesizing wMRI guides from HR qMRI using signal equations, then degrading qMRI resolution via k-space truncation. A deep neural network learns the super-resolution mapping. Ablation experiments demonstrate that T1-weighted images primarily enhance T1 maps, T2-weighted images improve T2 maps, and combined guidance optimally enhances all parameters simultaneously. Validation on independently acquired in-vivo data from a different qMRI sequence confirms cross-qMRI sequence generalizability. Models trained on synthetic data can produce super-resolved maps from a 1-minute acquisition with quality comparable to a 5-minute reference scan, leveraging the scanner-independent nature of relaxometry parameters.

Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs).

To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video.

Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed.

This is majorly due to the limitation of the distortion models assumed for the non-linearities present in the camera lens. This paper presents a framework for modeling a suitable distortion model that can be used for localizing the objects at longer distances. It is well known that neural networks can be a better alternative to model a highly complex non-linear lens distortion function; on contrary, it is observed that a direct application of neural networks to distortion models fails to converge to estimate the camera parameters. To resolve this, a hybrid approach is presented in this paper where the conventional distortion models are initially extended to incorporate higher-order terms and then enhanced using neural network based residual correction model. This hybrid approach has substantially improved long-range localization performance and is capable of estimating the 3D position of objects at distances up to 5 kilometres. The estimated 3D coordinates are transformed to GIS coordinates and are plotted on a GIS map for visualization. Experimental validation demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of proposed framework, offering a practical solution to calibrate CCTV cameras for long-range photogrammetry applications."}

Existing methods mainly fall into two categories: (1) static world generation models, which construct 3D environments without active agents, and (2) controllable-entity models, which allow a single entity to perform limited actions in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment. AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with the provided scene and character, formulated as a conditional autoregressive video generation problem. Built upon a pre-trained video generator, our training strategy significantly enhances motion dynamics while maintaining generalization across actions and characters. Our evaluation covers a broad range of aspects, including visual quality, character consistency, action controllability, and long-horizon coherence."}

Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes.

At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate.

Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations.

While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents.

The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision.

To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components."}

In the PCR and RFS classification tasks logistic regression model trained on radiomic features performed the best with an AUC of 0.88 and classification accuracy of 0.85 for PCR classification, and AUC of 0.78 and classification accuracy of 0.72 for RFS classification. Conclusions: It is evidenced that the image registration method has significantly improved performance in longitudinal feature learning in predicting PCR and RFS. The radiomics feature extractor is more effective than the pre-trained deep learning feature extractors, with higher performance and better interpretability."}

However, existing efforts focus primarily on increasing dataset size and overlook the question of whether the backbone network is an effective representation learner at scale. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting ConvNeXt-based architectures for volumetric segmentation and introducing MedNeXt-v2, a compound-scaled 3D ConvNeXt that leverages improved micro-architecture and data scaling to deliver state-of-the-art performance. First, we show that routinely used backbones in large-scale pretraining pipelines are often suboptimal. Subsequently, we use comprehensive backbone benchmarking prior to scaling and demonstrate that stronger from scratch performance reliably predicts stronger downstream performance after pretraining. Guided by these findings, we incorporate a 3D Global Response Normalization module and use depth, width, and context scaling to improve our architecture for effective representation learning. We pretrain MedNeXt-v2 on 18k CT volumes and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning across six challenging CT and MR benchmarks (144 structures), showing consistent gains over seven publicly released pretrained models. Beyond improvements, our benchmarking of these models also reveals that stronger backbones yield better results on similar data, representation scaling disproportionately benefits pathological segmentation, and that modality-specific pretraining offers negligible benefit once full finetuning is applied. In conclusion, our results establish MedNeXt-v2 as a strong backbone for large-scale supervised representation learning in 3D Medical Image Segmentation.

Although existing methods have achieved photorealistic reconstruction, they mostly focus on pinhole cameras and neglect fisheye cameras. In fact, how to effectively simulate fisheye cameras in driving scene remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose UniGaussian, a novel approach that learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation from multiple camera models for urban scene reconstruction in autonomous driving. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that distorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to fisheye camera models. This addresses the compatibility issue of 3D Gaussian splatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion caused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering while ensuring differentiability. Second, built on the differentiable rendering method, we design a new framework that learns a unified Gaussian representation from multiple camera models. By applying affine transformations to adapt different camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision from different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation with input data from multiple sources and achieves holistic driving scene understanding.

They have gained widespread attention in object detection due to their low power consumption and biological interpretability. However, existing SNN-based object detection methods suffer from local firing saturation, where adjacent neurons concurrently reach maximum firing rates, especially in object-centric regions. This abnormal neuron firing pattern reduces the feature discrimination capability and detection accuracy, while also increasing the firing rates that prevent SNNs from achieving their potential energy efficiency. To address this problem, we propose SpikeDet, a novel spiking object detector that optimizes firing patterns for accurate and energy-efficient detection. Specifically, we design a spiking backbone network, MDSNet, which effectively adjusts the membrane synaptic input distribution at each layer, achieving better neuron firing patterns during spiking feature extraction. For the neck, to better utilize and preserve these high-quality backbone features, we introduce the Spiking Multi-direction Fusion Module (SMFM), which realizes multi-direction fusion of spiking features, enhancing the multi-scale detection capability of the model. Furthermore, we propose the Local Firing Saturation Index (LFSI) to quantitatively measure local firing saturation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, with SpikeDet achieving superior performance. On the COCO 2017 dataset, it achieves 52.2% AP, outperforming previous SNN-based methods by 3.3% AP while requiring only half the power consumption.

The powerful generalization ability of pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight, incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e., TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and mitigate correlated forgetting.

Similar to the era of traditional DNNs, model stealing attacks also pose significant risks to LVMs. However, this paper reveals that most existing defense methods (developed for traditional DNNs), typically designed for models trained from scratch, either introduce additional security risks, are prone to misjudgment, or are even ineffective for fine-tuned models. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for personalized LVMs by decoupling similar common features. In general, our method consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow models that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting dataset-specific features. We represent the dataset-specific features of the victim model by computing the output differences between the shadow and victim models, without altering the victim model or its training process. After that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by determining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of the victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by hypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously. Our codes are available atthis https URL."}

Using multiple perceptual benchmarks spanning low-level image quality assessment, mid-level perceptual similarity, saliency correspondence, and noisy robustness, we identify a consistent, training-stage-dependent representational transition. Early training stages exhibit strong texture bias, elevated alignment with low-level human perceptual measures, and increased sensitivity to Gaussian noise perturbations. As training progresses, this texture bias gradually diminishes in favor of more shape-based representations, coinciding with improved robustness to noise and a decline in low-level perceptual alignment. Importantly, these dynamics are consistently observed across multiple CLIP model scales, indicating that the phenomenon is not specific to a particular architecture size. Our findings provide an empirical characterization of how perceptual alignment, feature bias, and robustness co-evolve during multimodal model training.

While existing analytic methods often treat images as indivisible wholes, real-world AI failures generally manifest as specific visual patterns that can evade holistic detection and suit more granular and decomposed analysis. Here we introduce a content analysis tool, Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE), which decompose images into interpretable visual patterns with natural language descriptions. Utilizing interpretability modules and large multimodal models, LanSE can automatically identify visual patterns within data modalities. Our method discovers more than 5,000 visual patterns with 93\\% human agreement, provides decomposed evaluation outperforming existing methods, establishes the first systematic evaluation of physical plausibility, and extends to medical imaging settings. Our method's capability to extract language-grounded patterns can be naturally adapted to numerous fields, including biology and geography, as well as other data modalities such as protein structures and time series, thereby advancing content analysis for generative AI."}

However, 3D instance segmentation based on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel \"split-then-grow\" framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene. Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks, thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features, particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects. Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and outdoor environments.

However, giga-scale foundation models, which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which consist of only $15\\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale) across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to image variations originating from multiple institutions.

This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection (EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model (MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought.

We propose Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition, leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images. Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image generation, and counterfactual generation tasks."}

We propose CLAReSNet (Convolutional Latent Attention Residual Spectral Network), a hybrid architecture that integrates multi-scale convolutional extraction with transformer-style attention via an adaptive latent bottleneck.

A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes."}

This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud.

We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline. Relative to the U-Net, ContextSeisNet also delivers improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal.

A Comprehensive Evaluation on 14 Tasks and 40 Datasets", "abstract": "The rapid evolution of text-to-image generation models has revolutionized visual content creation. While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while \\textbf{Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality}, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics. This report identifies Nano Banana Pro as a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, while highlighting that achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains a significant hurdle."}

Recent AIGC-based approaches partially automate asset creation and rigging, but they either inherit the heavy costs of full 3D pipelines or rely on video-synthesis paradigms that sacrifice 3D controllability and interactivity. We focus on single-image 3D animation generation and argue that progress is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control.To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis. The core idea is a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that uses a coarse 3D estimate as a structural carrier, while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This proxy formulation enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines, without requiring accurate geometry or expensive optimization, and naturally extends to coherent background animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms and outperforms video-based 3D animation generation in identity preservation, geometric and textural consistency, and the level of precise, interactive control it offers to users."}

Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities.

However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a powerful defense against image manipulation. Code is available atthis https URL."}

Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length.

Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres.

Bones have long been used to evaluate biological age, and the decline in bone density with age is a well-recognized phenomenon in adults. However, the pattern of this decline remains controversial, making it difficult to serve as a reliable indicator of the aging process. Here we present a novel AI-driven statistical method to assess the bone density, and a discovery that the bone mass distribution in trabecular bone of vertebrae follows a non-Gaussian, unimodal, and skewed distribution in CT images. The statistical mode of the distribution is defined as the measure of bone mass, which is a groundbreaking assessment of bone density, named Trabecular Bone Density (TBD). The dataset of CT images are collected from 1,719 patients who underwent PET/CT scans in three hospitals, in which a subset of the dataset is used for AI model training and generalization. Based upon the cases, we demonstrate that the pattern of bone density declining with aging exhibits a consistent trend of exponential decline across sexes and age groups using TBD assessment. The developed AI-driven statistical method blazes a trail in the field of AI for reliable quantitative computation and AI for medicine. The findings suggest that human aging is a gradual process, with the rate of decline slowing progressively over time, which will provide a valuable basis for scientific prediction of life expectancy."}

AIGI enables an innovative business mode called \"sell it before you make it\", where merchants can design fashion items and generate photorealistic images with digital models based on textual descriptions.

Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference.

We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce mimic-video, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations.

Experimental results show that both PGM and KPGM classifiers consistently outperform a classical random forest baseline, particularly when multiple quantum copies are employed. Notably, PGM with stereo encoding and n_copies=2 achieves the highest overall accuracy (0.8512) and F1-score (0.8234), while KPGM demonstrates competitive and more stable behavior across QSMOTE variants, with top scores of 0.8511 (stereo) and 0.8483 (amplitude). These findings highlight that quantum-inspired classifiers not only provide tangible gains in recall and balanced performance but also offer complementary strengths: PGM benefits from encoding-specific enhancements, whereas KPGM ensures robustness across sampling strategies. Our results advance the understanding of kernel-based and measurement-based QiML methods, offering practical guidance on their applicability under varying data characteristics and computational constraints."}

While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures mitigate some of these conflicts, their routing mechanisms typically rely on explicitly trained auxiliary classifiers. This not only increases system complexity but also often lacks interpretability when handling mixed-domain inputs.Building upon the premise that ``Compression is Intelligence,'' this paper proposes a novel architectural philosophy: \\textbf{``Compression is Routing.''} We trained an 87M-parameter end-to-end Transformer Autoencoder, achieving a \\textbf{64x sequence length compression} (compressing 512 tokens into 8 latent vectors). Experimental results demonstrate that this compressor possesses extreme domain discriminative capability: it achieves a reconstruction accuracy of \\textbf{99.47\\%} on the in-domain (code) validation set; accuracy drops sharply to \\textbf{47.76\\%} on a semi-out-of-distribution domain (Wiki text); and further plummets to just \\textbf{0.57\\%} on a fully out-of-distribution domain (random sequences).This extreme and systematic performance discrepancy establishes the validity of reconstruction error as an \\textbf{Intrinsic Distribution Fingerprint}. Based on this, we propose that expert modules can be automatically scheduled using reconstruction residuals directly, without the need for explicit gating networks. This mechanism offers excellent scalability. Furthermore, this architecture provides a new perspective on ``VRAM compression'' for handling ultra-long contexts. This report aims to verify the physical validity of this foundational architecture, offering a new research perspective for the next generation of scalable modular neural networks."}

Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%).

To solve this issue, canonical forms of TNs are parameterized via unitary matrices to simplify the computation of marginals. However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN. Inspired by the ideas of orthogonality in canonical forms and determinism in circuits enabling tractable maximization, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to overcome their marginalization overhead. Our parameterizations unlock efficient marginalization even in factorizations different from TNs, but encoded as circuits, whose structure would otherwise make marginalization computationally hard.

The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples.

The proposed method achieves memory efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while accumulating task saliency scores that enable curvature-aware merging without post-hoc Fisher computation.

Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation.

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload.

As a result, predicting EV charging demand has become a timely and important research problem. While substantial research has addressed energy load forecasting in transportation, relatively few studies systematically compare multiple forecasting methods across different temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels in diverse urban settings. This work investigates the effectiveness of five time series forecasting models, ranging from traditional statistical approaches to machine learning and deep learning methods. Forecasting performance is evaluated for short-, mid-, and long-term horizons (on the order of minutes, hours, and days, respectively), and across spatial scales ranging from individual charging stations to regional and city-level aggregations. The analysis is conducted on four publicly available real-world datasets, with results reported independently for each dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically evaluate EV charging demand forecasting across such a wide range of temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels using multiple real-world datasets."}

However, real-world QoS data are extremely sparse, noisy, and shaped by hierarchical dependencies arising from QoS interactions, and geographical and network-level factors, making accurate QoS prediction challenging. Existing methods often predict each QoS parameter separately, requiring multiple similar models, which increases computational cost and leads to poor generalization. Although recent joint QoS prediction studies have explored shared architectures, they suffer from negative transfer due to loss-scaling caused by inconsistent numerical ranges across QoS parameters and further struggle with inadequate representation learning, resulting in degraded accuracy. This paper presents an unified strategy for joint QoS prediction, called SHARP-QoS, that addresses these issues using three components. First, we introduce a dual mechanism to extract the hierarchical features from both QoS and contextual structures via hyperbolic convolution formulated in the Poincaré ball. Second, we propose an adaptive feature-sharing mechanism that allows feature exchange across informative QoS and contextual signals. A gated feature fusion module is employed to support dynamic feature selection among structural and shared representations. Third, we design an EMA-based loss balancing strategy that allows stable joint optimization, thereby mitigating the negative transfer. Evaluations on three datasets with two, three, and four QoS parameters demonstrate that SHARP-QoS outperforms both single- and multi-task baselines. Extensive study shows that our model effectively addresses major challenges, including sparsity, robustness to outliers, and cold-start, while maintaining moderate computational overhead, underscoring its capability for reliable joint QoS prediction."}

Prior work has attempted to extend BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of well-established mathematical properties has limited further theoretical analysis between MDPs. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) for measuring state similarity between arbitrary pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with three fundamental metric properties, i.e., GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and a distance bound on identical spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyze policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation across MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than existing ones derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios."}

Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals. MINPO, thus, generalizes beyond problem-specific formulations, providing a unified framework for systems governed by nonlocal operators."}

The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \\textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation.

Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms2.

By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments."}

To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics.

However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor.

These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks.

Compared to existing systems that use horizontal scheduling (i.e., executing micro-batches sequentially), GreedySnake achieves higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, bringing the system much closer to the ideal scenario predicted by the roofline model. To further mitigate the I/O bottleneck, GreedySnake overlaps part of the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration. Experimental results on A100 GPUs show that GreedySnake achieves saturated training throughput improvements over ZeRO-Infinity: 1.96x on 1 GPU and 1.93x on 4 GPUs for GPT-65B, and 2.53x on 1 GPU for GPT-175B.

This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving."}

In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers. We find that combining intermediate representations in individually trained models with a well placed pair of stitching layers allows this performance to recover to a competitive degree while maintaining improved generalization, showing that asynchronous collaboration can yield competitive results."}

Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning.

In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical approach for effectively adapting LMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods face two primary challenges: (1) High resource cost. Although PEFT methods significantly reduce resource demands compared to full fine-tuning, it still requires substantial time and memory, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. (2) Parameter dependency. PEFT methods heavily rely on updating a subset of parameters associated with LMs to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Yet, due to increasing competition in the LMs landscape, many companies have adopted closed-source policies for their leading models, offering access only via Application Programming Interface (APIs). Whereas, the expense is often cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain, as the fine-tuning process of LMs is extremely slow. Even if small models perform far worse than LMs in general, they can achieve superior results on particular distributions while requiring only minimal resources.

These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation.

While this experience learning capability enhances agentic autonomy, it introduces a critical, unexplored attack surface, i.e., the trust boundary between an agent's reasoning core and its own past. In this paper, we introduce MemoryGraft. It is a novel indirect injection attack that compromises agent behavior not through immediate jailbreaks, but by implanting malicious successful experiences into the agent's long-term memory. Unlike traditional prompt injections that are transient, or standard RAG poisoning that targets factual knowledge, MemoryGraft exploits the agent's semantic imitation heuristic which is the tendency to replicate patterns from retrieved successful tasks. We demonstrate that an attacker who can supply benign ingestion-level artifacts that the agent reads during execution can induce it to construct a poisoned RAG store where a small set of malicious procedure templates is persisted alongside benign experiences. When the agent later encounters semantically similar tasks, union retrieval over lexical and embedding similarity reliably surfaces these grafted memories, and the agent adopts the embedded unsafe patterns, leading to persistent behavioral drift across sessions.

However, the subtle structural variations in brain MRI scans often pose challenges for conventional deep learning models to extract discriminative features effectively. In this work, we propose PseudoColorViT-Alz, a colormap-enhanced Vision Transformer framework designed to leverage pseudo-color representations of MRI images for improved Alzheimer's disease classification. By combining colormap transformations with the global feature learning capabilities of Vision Transformers, our method amplifies anatomical texture and contrast cues that are otherwise subdued in standard grayscale MRI scans.We evaluate PseudoColorViT-Alz on the OASIS-1 dataset using a four-class classification setup (non-demented, moderate dementia, mild dementia, and very mild dementia). Our model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.79% with an AUC of 100%, surpassing the performance of recent 2024--2025 methods, including CNN-based and Siamese-network approaches, which reported accuracies ranging from 96.1% to 99.68%. These results demonstrate that pseudo-color augmentation combined with Vision Transformers can significantly enhance MRI-based Alzheimer's disease classification. PseudoColorViT-Alz offers a robust and interpretable framework that outperforms current methods, providing a promising tool to support clinical decision-making and early detection of Alzheimer's disease."}

The resulting representations automatically capture meaningful structure in the data: it recovers ground truth generative factors in our synthetic dataset, learns factorized, semantic latent dimensions from complex natural images, and encodes video sequences into latent trajectories that are straighter than those of alternative encoders, despite training exclusively on static images. Furthermore, SAMI can extract useful representations from pre-trained diffusion models with minimal additional training. Finally, the explicitly probabilistic formulation provides new ways to identify semantically meaningful axes in the absence of supervised labels, and its mathematical exactness allows us to make formal statements about the nature of the learned representation. Overall, these results indicate that implicit structural information in diffusion models can be made explicit and interpretable through synergistic combination with a variational autoencoder."}

In this paper, we study the problem of improving RecSys model predictions for cold-start (CS) items, which appear infrequently in the training data. Although this problem is well-studied in academia, few studies have addressed its root causes effectively at the scale of a platform like Pinterest. By investigating live traffic data, we identified several challenges of the CS problem and developed a corresponding solution for each: First, industrial-scale RecSys models must operate under tight computational constraints. Since CS items are a minority, any related improvements must be highly cost-efficient. To address this, our solutions were designed to be lightweight, collectively increasing the total parameters by only 5%. Second, CS items are represented only by non-historical (e.g., content or attribute) features, which models often treat as less important. To elevate their significance, we introduce a residual connection for the non-historical features. Third, CS items tend to receive lower prediction scores compared to non-CS items, reducing their likelihood of being surfaced. We mitigate this by incorporating a score regularization term into the model. Fourth, the labels associated with CS items are sparse, making it difficult for the model to learn from them. We apply the manifold mixup technique to address this data sparsity. Implemented together, our methods increased fresh content engagement at Pinterest by 10% without negatively impacting overall engagement and cost, and have been deployed to serve over 570 million users on Pinterest."}

Classical optimal procedures often rely on strong structural assumptions, which can be misspecified in practice and complicate deployment. This limitation has sparked growing interest in structure-agnostic approaches -- methods that debias black-box nuisance estimates without imposing structural priors. Understanding the fundamental limits of these methods is therefore crucial. This paper provides a systematic investigation of the optimal error rates achievable by structure-agnostic estimators. We first show that, for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE), a central parameter in causal inference, doubly robust learning attains optimal structure-agnostic error rates. We then extend our analysis to a general class of functionals that depend on unknown nuisance functions and establish the structure-agnostic optimality of debiased/double machine learning (DML). We distinguish two regimes -- one where double robustness is attainable and one where it is not -- leading to different optimal rates for first-order debiasing, and show that DML is optimal in both regimes. Finally, we instantiate our general lower bounds by deriving explicit optimal rates that recover existing results and extend to additional estimands of interest. Our results provide theoretical validation for widely used first-order debiasing methods and guidance for practitioners seeking optimal approaches in the absence of structural assumptions. This paper generalizes and subsumes the ATE lower bound established in \\citet{jin2024structure} by the same authors."}

A fundamental trade-off arises between the timeliness of the information maintained at the AP and the update cost incurred at the device. To address this trade-off, we propose an online algorithm that determines when to transmit updates using only available observations. The proposed algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal competitive ratio against an adversary that can simultaneously manipulate multiple sources of uncertainty, including the operation duration, the information staleness, the update cost, and the availability of update opportunities. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning (ML) advice of unknown reliability into the design, we develop an ML-augmented algorithm that asymptotically attains the optimal consistency-robustness trade-off, even when the adversary can additionally corrupt the ML advice. The optimal competitive ratio scales linearly with the range of update costs, but is unaffected by other uncertainties. Moreover, an optimal competitive online algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to the ML advice: it either fully trusts or completely ignores the ML advice, as partially trusting the advice cannot improve the consistency without severely degrading the robustness. Extensive simulations in stochastic settings further validate the theoretical findings in the adversarial environment."}

Starting from the 1RSB formulation of belief propagation, we derive explicit update rules of 1RSB-AMP together with the corresponding state evolution (1RSB-SE) equations. A detailed comparison shows that 1RSB-AMP and 1RSB-SE agree remarkably well at the macroscopic level, even in parameter regions where replica-symmetric (RS) AMP, termed RS-AMP, diverges and where the 1RSB description itself is not expected to be thermodynamically exact. Fixed-point analysis of 1RSB-SE reveals a phase diagram consisting of success, failure, and diverging phases, as in the RS case. However, the diverging-region boundary now depends on the Parisi parameter due to the 1RSB ansatz, and we propose a new criterion -- minimizing the size of the diverging region -- rather than the conventional zero-complexity condition, to determine its value. Combining this criterion with the nonconvexity-control (NCC) protocol proposed in a previous RS study improves the algorithmic limit of perfect reconstruction compared with RS-AMP. Numerical solutions of 1RSB-SE and experiments with 1RSB-AMP confirm that this improved limit is achieved in practice, though the gain is modest and remains slightly inferior to the Bayes-optimal threshold. We also report the behavior of thermodynamic quantities -- overlaps, free entropy, complexity, and the non-self-averaging susceptibility -- that characterize the 1RSB phase in this problem."}

Prior research has typically examined single issues such as class imbalance or feature irrelevance in isolation, overlooking that real-world data problems frequently co-occur and interact. This study presents, to our knowledge, the first large-scale empirical analysis in SDP that simultaneously examines five co-occurring data quality issues (class imbalance, class overlap, irrelevant features, attribute noise, and outliers) across 374 datasets and five classifiers. We employ Explainable Boosting Machines together with stratified interaction analysis to quantify both direct and conditional effects under default hyperparameter settings, reflecting practical baseline usage.Our results show that co-occurrence is nearly universal: even the least frequent issue (attribute noise) appears alongside others in more than 93% of datasets. Irrelevant features and imbalance are nearly ubiquitous, while class overlap is the most consistently harmful issue. We identify stable tipping points around 0.20 for class overlap, 0.65-0.70 for imbalance, and 0.94 for irrelevance, beyond which most models begin to degrade. We also uncover counterintuitive patterns, such as outliers improving performance when irrelevant features are low, underscoring the importance of context-aware evaluation. Finally, we expose a performance-robustness trade-off: no single learner dominates under all conditions.By jointly analyzing prevalence, co-occurrence, thresholds, and conditional effects, our study directly addresses a persistent gap in SDP research. Hence, moving beyond isolated analyses to provide a holistic, data-aware understanding of how quality issues shape model performance in real-world settings."}

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance."}

Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown great success in complex domains, such as robotics and protein folding, but its application to flow control is hindered by a lack of standardized benchmark platforms and the computational demands of fluid simulations. To address these challenges, we introduce HydroGym, a solver-independent RL platform for flow control research. HydroGym integrates sophisticated flow control benchmarks, scalable runtime infrastructure, and state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Our platform includes 42 validated environments spanning from canonical laminar flows to complex three-dimensional turbulent scenarios, validated over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. We provide non-differentiable solvers for traditional RL and differentiable solvers that dramatically improve sample efficiency through gradient-enhanced optimization. Comprehensive evaluation reveals that RL agents consistently discover robust control principles across configurations, such as boundary layer manipulation, acoustic feedback disruption, and wake reorganization. Transfer learning studies demonstrate that controllers learned at one Reynolds number or geometry adapt efficiently to new conditions, requiring approximately 50% fewer training episodes.

While these stages enhance capability, they introduce significant system bottlenecks. First, multimodal preprocessing-especially video decoding-often dominates Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). Most systems rely on CPU-based decoding, which severely limits throughput, while existing GPU-based approaches prioritize throughput-oriented parallelism and fail to meet the latency-sensitive requirements of MLLM inference. Second, the vision encoder is a standalone, compute-intensive stage that produces visual embeddings and cannot be co-batched with LLM prefill or decoding. This heterogeneity forces inter-stage blocking and increases token-generation latency. Even when deployed on separate GPUs, these stages underutilize available compute and memory resources, reducing overall utilization and constraining system throughput.To address these challenges, we present FlashCodec and UnifiedServe, two complementary designs that jointly optimize the end-to-end MLLM pipeline. FlashCodec accelerates the multimodal preprocessing stage through collaborative multi-GPU video decoding, reducing decoding latency while preserving high throughput.

This paper presents MADOOD, a novel two stage, cluster driven deep learning framework for robust OOD malware detection and classification. In the first stage, malware family embeddings are modeled using class conditional spherical decision boundaries derived from Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), enabling statistically grounded separation of indistribution and OOD samples without requiring OOD data during training. Z score based distance analysis across multiple class centroids is employed to reliably identify anomalous samples in the latent space. In the second stage, a deep neural network integrates cluster based predictions, refined embeddings, and supervised classifier outputs to enhance final classification accuracy.

Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary.

Method: The proposed framework includes tumour segmentation, image registration, feature extraction, and predictive modelling. Using the image registration method, MRI image features can be extracted and compared from the original tumour site at different time points, therefore monitoring the intratumor changes during NACT process. Four feature extractors, including one radiomics and three deep learning-based (MedicalNet, Segformer3D, SAM-Med3D) were implemented and compared. In combination with three feature selection methods and four ML models, predictive models are built and compared. Results: The proposed image registration-based feature extraction consistently improves the predictive models. In the PCR and RFS classification tasks logistic regression model trained on radiomic features performed the best with an AUC of 0.88 and classification accuracy of 0.85 for PCR classification, and AUC of 0.78 and classification accuracy of 0.72 for RFS classification. Conclusions: It is evidenced that the image registration method has significantly improved performance in longitudinal feature learning in predicting PCR and RFS. The radiomics feature extractor is more effective than the pre-trained deep learning feature extractors, with higher performance and better interpretability."}

However, existing efforts focus primarily on increasing dataset size and overlook the question of whether the backbone network is an effective representation learner at scale. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting ConvNeXt-based architectures for volumetric segmentation and introducing MedNeXt-v2, a compound-scaled 3D ConvNeXt that leverages improved micro-architecture and data scaling to deliver state-of-the-art performance. First, we show that routinely used backbones in large-scale pretraining pipelines are often suboptimal. Subsequently, we use comprehensive backbone benchmarking prior to scaling and demonstrate that stronger from scratch performance reliably predicts stronger downstream performance after pretraining. Guided by these findings, we incorporate a 3D Global Response Normalization module and use depth, width, and context scaling to improve our architecture for effective representation learning. We pretrain MedNeXt-v2 on 18k CT volumes and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning across six challenging CT and MR benchmarks (144 structures), showing consistent gains over seven publicly released pretrained models. Beyond improvements, our benchmarking of these models also reveals that stronger backbones yield better results on similar data, representation scaling disproportionately benefits pathological segmentation, and that modality-specific pretraining offers negligible benefit once full finetuning is applied. In conclusion, our results establish MedNeXt-v2 as a strong backbone for large-scale supervised representation learning in 3D Medical Image Segmentation.

We present a Domain-Aware Quantum Circuit (DAQC) that leverages image priors to guide locality-preserving encoding and entanglement via non-overlapping DCT-style zigzag windows. The design employs interleaved encode-entangle-train cycles, where entanglement is applied among qubits hosting neighboring pixels, aligned to device connectivity. This staged, locality-preserving information flow expands the effective receptive field without deep global mixing, enabling efficient use of limited depth and qubits. The design concentrates representational capacity on short-range correlations, reduces long-range two-qubit operations, and encourages stable optimization, thereby mitigating depth-induced and globally entangled barren-plateau effects. We evaluate DAQC on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and PneumoniaMNIST datasets. On quantum hardware, DAQC achieves performance competitive with strong classical baselines (e.g., ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) and substantially outperforming Quantum Circuit Search (QCS) baselines.

Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations.

In this work, we propose a framework to define a parametric vertical coordinate system as a learnable component within a differentiable dynamical core. We develop an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver for the two-dimensional non-hydrostatic Euler equations on an Arakawa C-grid, and introduce a NEUral Vertical Enhancement (NEUVE) terrain-following coordinate based on an integral transformed neural network that guarantees monotonicity. A key feature of our approach is the use of automatic differentiation to compute exact geometric metric terms, thereby eliminating truncation errors associated with finite-difference coordinate derivatives. By coupling simulation errors through the time integration to the parameterization, our formulation finds a grid structure optimized for both the underlying physics and numerics. Using several standard tests, we demonstrate that these learned coordinates reduce the mean squared error by a factor of 1.4 to 2 in non-linear statistical benchmarks, and eliminate spurious vertical velocity striations over steep topography."}

However, existing DA approaches suffer from prohibitively high computational costs and memory demands when applied to even medium-scale datasets and models, forcing practitioners to resort to approximations that may fail to capture the true inference process of the underlying model.

These issues are compounded by a dynamic reminiscent of Goodhart's law: as benchmark performance becomes the primary target for model development, the benchmarks themselves become less reliable indicators of genuine mathematical capability. We systematically explore these limitations and contend that enhancing the capabilities of large language models, or any forthcoming advancements in AI-based mathematical assistants (copilots or ``thought partners''), necessitates a course correction both in the design of mathematical datasets and the evaluation criteria of the models' mathematical ability. In particular, it is necessary for benchmarks to move beyond the existing result-based datasets that map theorem statements directly to proofs, and instead focus on datasets that translate the richer facets of mathematical research practice into data that LLMs can learn from. This includes benchmarks that supervise the proving process and the proof discovery process itself, and we advocate for mathematical dataset developers to consider the concept of \"motivated proof\", introduced by G.

Thus, optimal agnostic learners are permitted to incur excess error on (easier-to-learn) distributions $\\mathcal{D}$ for which $\\tau = \\mathrm{err}(h^*_{\\mathcal{D}})$ is small.Recent work of Hanneke, Larsen, and Zhivotovskiy (FOCS `24) addresses this shortcoming by including $\\tau$ itself as a parameter in the agnostic error term.

The popular optimizers used to train these models are stochastic gradient descent-based algorithms, which face inherent limitations, such as slow convergence and stringent assumptions for convergence. In particular, data heterogeneity arising from distributed settings poses significant challenges to their theoretical and numerical performance. This paper develops an algorithm, PISA (Preconditioned Inexact Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers). Grounded in rigorous theoretical guarantees, the algorithm converges under the sole assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the gradient on a bounded region, thereby removing the need for other conditions commonly imposed by stochastic methods. This capability enables the proposed algorithm to tackle the challenge of data heterogeneity effectively. Moreover, the algorithmic architecture enables scalable parallel computing and supports various preconditions, such as second-order information, second moment, and orthogonalized momentum by Newton-Schulz iterations. Incorporating the latter two preconditions in PISA yields two computationally efficient variants: SISA and NSISA. Comprehensive experimental evaluations for training or fine-tuning diverse deep models, including vision models, large language models, reinforcement learning models, generative adversarial networks, and recurrent neural networks, demonstrate superior numerical performance of SISA and NSISA compared to various state-of-the-art optimizers."}

Diffusion models are an emerging generative ML technique with the ability to produce sharper, more realistic images by learning the underlying data distribution. Diffusion models are becoming more prevalent, yet adapting them for earth science applications can be challenging because most articles focus on theoretical aspects of the approach, rather than making the method widely accessible. This work illustrates score-based diffusion models with a well-known problem in atmospheric science: cloud nowcasting (zero-to-three-hour forecast). After discussing the background and intuition of score-based diffusion models using examples from geostationary satellite infrared imagery, we experiment with three types of diffusion models: a standard score-based diffusion model (Diff); a residual correction diffusion model (CorrDiff); and a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our results show that the diffusion models not only advect existing clouds, but also generate and decay clouds, including convective initiation. A case study qualitatively shows the preservation of high-resolution features longer into the forecast than a conventional U-Net. The best of the three diffusion models tested was the CorrDiff approach, outperforming all other diffusion models, the conventional U-Net, and persistence. The diffusion models also enable out-of-the-box ensemble generation with skillful calibration. By explaining and exploring diffusion models for a common problem and ending with lessons learned from adapting diffusion models for our task, this work provides a starting point for the community to utilize diffusion models for a variety of earth science applications."}

A common limitation shared by many of these models is their reliance on an equiangular discretization of the sphere which suffers from a much finer grid at the poles than around the equator. In contrast, in the Hierarchical Equal Area iso-Latitude Pixelization (HEALPix) of the sphere, each pixel covers the same surface area, removing unphysical biases.

In the PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on nine standard forward PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in settings where the others diverge."}

Our key theoretical contribution proves the existence of an optimal reward threshold capable of separating winning and losing responses with high probability, which enables a principled pseudo-labeling of unpaired data. By leveraging these pseudo-labels, SSPO effectively distills latent preferences from large-scale unpaired data, thus maintaining human alignment while drastically reducing acquisition costs.

We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $O(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated.

However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends.

To ground this investigation, we introduce FAITH, a framework designed to systematically probe the strengths and limitations of this KG-based approach. FAITH operates without reference answers by decomposing responses into atomic claims, linking them to a medical KG, and scoring them based on evidence paths. Experiments on diverse medical tasks with human subjective evaluations demonstrate that KG-grounded evaluation achieves considerably higher correlations with clinician judgments and can effectively distinguish LLMs with varying capabilities.

Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-k thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. Look-ahead reasoning can be seen as a generalization of algorithmic collective action; we thus offer the first results characterizing the utility trade-offs of coordination when contesting algorithmic systems."}

When SDMs are intended for spatial or temporal transfer, random CV can lead to overoptimistic results due to spatial autocorrelation (SAC) among neighboring observations.We benchmark four machine learning algorithms (GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest) on two real-world presence-absence datasets, a temperate plant and an anadromous fish, using multiple CV designs: random, spatial, spatio-temporal, environmental, and forward-chaining. Two training data usage strategies (LAST FOLD and RETRAIN) are evaluated, with hyperparameter tuning performed within each CV scheme. Model performance is assessed on independent out-of-time test sets using AUC, MAE, and correlation metrics.Random CV overestimates AUC by up to 0.16 and produces MAE values up to 80 percent higher than spatially blocked alternatives. Blocking at the empirical SAC range substantially reduces this bias. Training strategy affects evaluation outcomes: LAST FOLD yields smaller validation-test discrepancies under strong SAC, while RETRAIN achieves higher test AUC when SAC is weaker. Boosted ensemble models consistently perform best under spatially structured CV designs. We recommend a robust SDM workflow based on SAC-aware blocking, blocked hyperparameter tuning, and external temporal validation to improve reliability under spatial and temporal shifts."}

Critical challenges persist, including generalizability across complex geometries and adaptability to position-dependent variations in batch production. Traditional methods of controlling geometric deviations often rely on complex parameterized models and repetitive metrology, which can be time-consuming yet not applicable for batch production. In this paper, we present a novel, process-agnostic approach to address the challenge of ensuring geometric precision and accuracy in position-dependent AM production. The proposed GraphCompNet presents a novel computational framework integrating graph-based neural networks with a GAN inspired training paradigm. The framework leverages point cloud representations and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs) to model intricate geometries while incorporating position-specific thermal and mechanical variations. A two-stage adversarial training process iteratively refines compensated designs using a compensator-predictor architecture, enabling real-time feedback and optimization. Experimental validation across various shapes and positions demonstrates the framework's ability to predict deviations in freeform geometries and adapt to position-dependent batch production conditions, significantly improving compensation accuracy (35 to 65 percent) across the entire printing space, addressing position-dependent variabilities within the print chamber.

Building on this, we introduce a new extension of the IOD (integrating overlapping datasets) algorithm incorporating tiered background knowledge, the 'tiered IOD' (tIOD) algorithm. We show that under full usage of the tiered background knowledge tFCI and tIOD are sound, while simple versions of the tIOD and tFCI are sound and complete. We further show that the tIOD algorithm can often be expected to be considerably more efficient and informative than the IOD algorithm even beyond the obvious restriction of the Markov equivalence classes. We provide a formal result on the conditions for this gain in efficiency and informativeness.

We introduce QAlign, a new test-time alignment approach. As we scale test-time compute, QAlign converges to sampling from the optimal aligned distribution for each individual prompt. By adopting recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo for text generation, our method enables better-aligned outputs without modifying the underlying model or even requiring logit access. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QAlign on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and GSM-Symbolic) using a task-specific RM, showing consistent improvements over existing test-time compute methods like best-of-n and majority voting. Furthermore, when applied with more realistic RMs trained on the Tulu 3 preference dataset, QAlign outperforms direct preference optimization (DPO), best-of-n, majority voting, and weighted majority voting on a diverse range of datasets (GSM8K, MATH500, IFEval, MMLU-Redux, and TruthfulQA).

The method follows a two-step procedure: we first estimate the drift term function, then the (matrix-valued) diffusion function given the drift. Occupation kernels are integral functionals on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that aggregate information over a trajectory. Our approach leverages vector-valued occupation kernels for estimating the drift component of the stochastic process. For diffusion estimation, we extend this framework by introducing operator-valued occupation kernels, enabling the estimation of an auxiliary matrix-valued function as a positive semi-definite operator, from which we readily derive the diffusion estimate. This enables us to avoid common challenges in SDE learning, such as intractable likelihoods, by optimizing a reconstruction-error-based objective. We propose a simple learning procedure that retains strong predictive accuracy while using Fenchel duality to promote efficiency. We validate the method on simulated benchmarks and a real-world dataset of Amyloid imaging in healthy and Alzheimer's disease subjects."}

In many large-scale applications, the matrices involved are too large to store or access in full, making even a single matrix-vector (mat-vec) product infeasible. Instead, one often has access only to small subblocks of the matrix or localized matrix-vector products on restricted index sets. Hutch++ achieves optimal convergence rate but relies on randomized SVD and assumes full mat-vec access, making it difficult to apply in these constrained settings. We propose the Block-Orthonormal Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (BOLT), which matches Hutch++ accuracy with a simpler implementation based on orthonormal block probes and Lanczos iterations. BOLT builds on the Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (SLQ) framework, which combines random probing with Krylov subspace methods to efficiently approximate traces of matrix functions, and performs better than Hutch++ in near flat-spectrum regimes. To address memory limitations and partial access constraints, we introduce Subblock SLQ, a variant of BOLT that operates only on small principal submatrices. As a result, this framework yields a proxy KL divergence estimator and an efficient method for computing the Wasserstein-2 distance between Gaussians - both compatible with low-memory and partial-access regimes.

However, approaches based on do-calculus may encounter computational challenges as the number of variables increases and the causal graph grows in complexity. Consequently, there exists a need to reduce the size of such models while preserving the essential features. For this purpose, we propose pruning (removing unnecessary variables) and clustering (combining variables) as preprocessing operations for causal data fusion. We generalize earlier results on a single data source and derive conditions for applying pruning and clustering in the case of multiple data sources. We give sufficient conditions for inferring the identifiability or non-identifiability of a causal effect in a larger graph based on a smaller graph and show how to obtain the corresponding identifying functional for identifiable causal effects.

In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and computational cost.

In this work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples) without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch. By analyzing local properties of the learned force fields, we find that pre-training produces more structured latent representations, smoother force responses to local geometric changes, and more consistent force differences between nearby configurations, all of which contribute to more stable and reliable MD simulations. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability."}

This prior naturally increases uncertainty for inputs that lie far from the training distribution in regions where predictive performance is likely to degrade. To efficiently approximate the resulting posterior predictive distribution, we employ amortized variational inference. Finally, we construct synthetic environments by drawing small bootstrap samples from the training data, simulating a range of plausible covariate shift using only the original dataset.

Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data.

Estimating resource requirements in advance is challenging due to a wide range of analysis scenarios, varying skill levels among community members, and the continuously increasing spectrum of computing options. One practical approach to mitigate these challenges involves initially processing a subset of each step to measure precise resource utilization from actual processing profiles before completing the entire step. While this two-staged approach enables processing on optimal resources for most of the workflow, it has drawbacks such as initial inaccuracies leading to potential failures and suboptimal resource usage, along with overhead from waiting for initial processing completion, which is critical for fast-turnaround analyses.

We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug.

Experimental measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5 conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping prediction for design and operational support."}

We propose CLAReSNet (Convolutional Latent Attention Residual Spectral Network), a hybrid architecture that integrates multi-scale convolutional extraction with transformer-style attention via an adaptive latent bottleneck. The model employs a multi-scale convolutional stem with deep residual blocks and an enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module for hierarchical spatial features, followed by spectral encoder layers combining bidirectional RNNs (LSTM/GRU) with Multi-Scale Spectral Latent Attention (MSLA). MSLA reduces complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(T^2D)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(T\\log(T)D)$ by adaptive latent token allocation (8-64 tokens) that scales logarithmically with the sequence length. Hierarchical cross-attention fusion dynamically aggregates multi-level representations for robust classification. Experiments conducted on the Indian Pines and Salinas datasets show state-of-the-art performance, achieving overall accuracies of 99.71% and 99.96%, significantly surpassing HybridSN, SSRN, and SpectralFormer.

Traditional methods face challenges, such as noisy data, and manual parameter tuning, among others. Recently deep learning approaches have proposed alternative solutions to some of these problems. However, important challenges of existing deep learning approaches are spatially inconsistent results across neighboring seismic gathers and lack of user-control. We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline. Relative to the U-Net, ContextSeisNet also delivers improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal. Notably, ContextSeisNet achieves comparable field data performance despite being trained on 90% less data, demonstrating substantial data efficiency. These results establish ContextSeisNet as a practical approach for spatially consistent seismic demultiple with potential applicability to other seismic processing tasks."}

This premature semantic collapse -- the tendency to collapse multiple valid interpretations into a single output -- stems from classical identity assumptions embedded in standard neural architectures. We propose Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a computational framework that treats ambiguity retention as a valid reasoning mode rather than a defect to be eliminated. NRR introduces three core principles: (1) Non-Identity ($A \\neq A$) -- the same symbol refers to different entities across contexts; (2) Approximate Identity ($A \\approx A$) -- entities share partial structural overlap without being identical; and (3) Non-Resolution -- conflicting interpretations can coexist without forced convergence. We formalize these principles through three architectural components: Multi-Vector Embeddings for context-dependent representation, Non-Collapsing Attention for parallel interpretation retention, and Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT) for maintaining $A \\neq A$ across inference. We demonstrate NRR's advantages through case studies in paradox handling, creative generation, and context-dependent reasoning. Crucially, we provide a minimal empirical validation on a synthetic context-shift task where an NRR-lite model achieves 90.9% out-of-distribution accuracy compared to 9.1% for standard architectures, demonstrating that ambiguity preservation enables structural generalization. NRR challenges the assumption that meaning must collapse to be useful, offering a foundation for AI systems capable of sophisticated ambiguity handling and creative reasoning. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control."}

This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce mimic-video, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations.

We employ Explainable Boosting Machines together with stratified interaction analysis to quantify both direct and conditional effects under default hyperparameter settings, reflecting practical baseline usage.Our results show that co-occurrence is nearly universal: even the least frequent issue (attribute noise) appears alongside others in more than 93% of datasets. Irrelevant features and imbalance are nearly ubiquitous, while class overlap is the most consistently harmful issue. We identify stable tipping points around 0.20 for class overlap, 0.65-0.70 for imbalance, and 0.94 for irrelevance, beyond which most models begin to degrade. We also uncover counterintuitive patterns, such as outliers improving performance when irrelevant features are low, underscoring the importance of context-aware evaluation. Finally, we expose a performance-robustness trade-off: no single learner dominates under all conditions.By jointly analyzing prevalence, co-occurrence, thresholds, and conditional effects, our study directly addresses a persistent gap in SDP research.

Understanding Smart Contract Semantics and Interactions in the NFT Ecosystem", "abstract": "The NFT ecosystem represents an interconnected, decentralized environment that encompasses the creation, distribution, and trading of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), where key actors, such as marketplaces, sellers, and buyers, utilize smart contracts to facilitate secure, transparent, and trustless transactions. Scam tokens are deliberately created to mislead users and facilitate financial exploitation, posing significant risks in the NFT ecosystem. Prior work has explored the NFT ecosystem from various perspectives, including security challenges, actor behaviors, and risks from scams and wash trading, leaving a gap in understanding the semantics and interactions of smart contracts during transactions, and how the risks associated with scam tokens manifest in relation to the semantics and interactions of contracts. To bridge this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on smart contract semantics and interactions in the NFT ecosystem, using a curated dataset of nearly 100 million transactions across 20 million blocks on Ethereum. We observe a limited semantic diversity among smart contracts in the NFT ecosystem, dominated by proxy, token, and DeFi contracts. Marketplace and proxy registry contracts are the most frequently involved in smart contract interactions during transactions, engaging with a broad spectrum of contracts in the ecosystem. Token contracts exhibit bytecode-level diversity, whereas scam tokens exhibit bytecode convergence. Certain interaction patterns between smart contracts are common to both risky and non-risky transactions, while others are predominantly associated with risky transactions. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to mitigate risks in the blockchain ecosystem, and outline future research directions."}

We demonstrate that ROS 2 applications can be abstracted as forests of trees, enabling the mapping of ROS 2 applications to traditional real-time DAG task models. Our usage of the events executor requires a special implementation of the events queue and a communication middleware that supports LIFO-ordered message delivery, features not yet standard in ROS2. We show that our implementation generates the same schedules as a conventional fixed-priority DAG task scheduler, in spite of lacking access to the precedence information that usually is required.

The benchmarking framework is validated against CFTT's datasets. The framework enables fair and reproducible comparison across tools and forensic scripts, establishing the first unified, automated, and extensible benchmarking framework for digital forensic tool testing and validation.

However, the LLM-based approaches generally regard vulnerability repair as a sequence-to-sequence task, and do not explicitly capture the syntax patterns for different vulnerability types, leading to limited accuracy. We aim to create a method that ensures the specificity of prompts targeting vulnerable code while also leveraging the generative capabilities of Large Language Models. Methods: We propose SPVR (Syntax-to-Prompt Vulnerability Repair), a novel framework that collects information from syntax trees, and generates corresponding prompts. Our method consists of three steps: rule design, prompt generation, and patch generation. In the rule design step, our method parses code patches and designs rules to extract relevant contextual information. These rules aid in identifying vulnerability-related issues. In the prompt generation step, our method extracts information from vulnerable code with pre-defined rules, automatically converting them into prompts. We also incorporate the description of CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) as known information into the prompts. Finally, in the patch generation step, this prompt will serve as input to any conversational LLM to obtain code patches. Results: Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves excellent results in assisting LLMs to fix vulnerabilities accurately. We utilize multiple Large Language Models to validate the effectiveness of our work, repairing 143 of 547 vulnerable code using ChatGPT-4. We conducted a comparison of our approach against several existing vulnerability repair approaches (including fine-tuning-based and prompt-based), across multiple metrics."}

We leverage large language models (LLMs) to comprehend API specifications, mine constraints for response bodies, and generate test cases. To reduce LLM hallucination, we apply an Observation-Confirmation (OC) scheme that uses initial prompts to contextualize constraints, allowing subsequent prompts to more accurately confirm their presence. Our empirical results show that RBCTest with OC prompting achieves high precision in constraint mining, with averages ranging from 85.1% to 93.6%.

This paper addresses part of this gap through a multi-phased investigation of developer interactions with an LLM-powered code editing feature, Transform Code, in an IDE widely used at Google. First, we analyze telemetry logs of the feature usage, revealing that frequent re-prompting can be an indicator of developer struggles with using Transform Code. Second, we conduct a qualitative analysis of unsatisfactory requests, identifying five key categories of information often missing from developer prompts. Finally, based on these findings, we propose and evaluate a tool, AutoPrompter, for automatically improving prompts by inferring missing information from the surrounding code context, leading to a 27% improvement in edit correctness on our test set."}

While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants.

Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if necessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated validation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high engineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test suites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective translation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made by the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results.We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four repository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs from their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub projects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results."}

As newer releases of these libraries are published, developers may opt to pin their dependencies to a particular version. While pinning may have benefits in ensuring reproducible builds and avoiding breaking changes, it bears larger risks in using outdated dependencies that may contain bugs and security vulnerabilities. To understand the frequency and consequences of dependency pinning, we first define the concepts of stale and fresh pins, which are distinguished based on how outdated the dependency is relative to the release date of the project. We conduct an empirical study to show that over 60% of consumers of popular Maven libraries contain stale pins to their dependencies, with some outdated versions over a year old. These pinned versions often miss out on security fixes; we find that 10% of all dependency upgrades in our dataset to the latest minor or patch version would reduce security vulnerabilities.We prototype an approach called Pin-Freshener that can encourage developers to freshen their pins by leveraging the insight that crowdsourced tests of peer projects can provide additional signal for the safety of an upgrade. Running Pin-Freshener on dependency upgrades shows that just 1-5 additional test suites can provide 35-100% more coverage of a dependency, compared to that of a single consumer test suite. Our evaluation on real-world pins to the top 500 popular libraries in Maven shows that Pin-Freshener can provide an additional signal of at least 5 passing crowdsourced test suites to over 3,000 consumers to safely perform an upgrade that reduces security vulnerabilities. Pin-Freshener can provide practical confidence to developers by offering additional signal beyond their own test suites, representing an improvement over current practices."}

However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code.This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code."}

To explore this, we present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the capabilities and characteristics of LLM-driven sampling. We design and implement LLM4Perf, a feedback-based framework, and use it to systematically evaluate the LLM-guided sampling process across four highly configurable, real-world systems. Our study reveals that the LLM-guided approach outperforms traditional baselines in most cases. Quantitatively, LLM4Perf achieves the best performance in nearly 68.8% (77 out of 112) of all evaluation scenarios, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. We find this effectiveness stems from the LLM's dual capabilities of configuration space pruning and feedback-driven strategy refinement. The effectiveness of this pruning is further validated by the fact that it also improves the performance of the baseline methods in nearly 91.5% (410 out of 448) of cases. Furthermore, we show how the LLM choices for each component and hyperparameters within LLM4Perf affect its effectiveness.

Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse, producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this, we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated, evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community feedback. The development of other middleware elements is guided by the community needs and subject to ongoing evaluations. To demonstrate the utility of our contributions, we illustrate dynamic AC management in an example involving assurance of adversarial robustness in large language models."}

Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions. First, we introduce ParamExplorer, an interactive and modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that helps the exploration of parameter spaces in generative art algorithms, guided by human-in-the-loop or even automated feedback. The framework also integrates seamlessly with existing p5js projects. Second, within this framework we implement and evaluate several exploration strategies, referred to as agents."}
