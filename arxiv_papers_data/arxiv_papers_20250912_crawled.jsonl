Dembski,James Rickards", "title": "An Interval Type-2 Version of Bayes Theorem Derived from Interval Probability Range Estimates Provided by Subject Matter Experts", "abstract": "Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version. First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for Computing with Words applications."}

Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.

This shift to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in recursive training.We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the era of increasing synthetic data."}

As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore, different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents, such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks."}

In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments. Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end, we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning. Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.

In particular, to explicitly and comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios, given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion.

Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located, synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military, law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136 participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task. Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship, suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support systems."}

Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental information.

Auras disaggregates the perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and providing high throughput."}

Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then, we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute significantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations -- curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns. Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast, recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time compute for long-horizon tasks."}

To address this, we propose PerFairX, a unified evaluation framework designed to quantify the trade-offs between personalization and demographic equity in LLM-generated recommendations. Using neutral and personality-sensitive prompts across diverse user profiles, we benchmark two state-of-the-art LLMs, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, on movie (MovieLens 10M) and music (this http URL360K) datasets. Our results reveal that personality-aware prompting significantly improves alignment with individual traits but can exacerbate fairness disparities across demographic groups. Specifically, DeepSeek achieves stronger psychological fit but exhibits higher sensitivity to prompt variations, while ChatGPT delivers stable yet less personalized outputs. PerFairX provides a principled benchmark to guide the development of LLM-based recommender systems that are both equitable and psychologically informed, contributing to the creation of inclusive, user-centric AI applications in continual learning contexts."}

I explain how this becomes a problem in the context of justification for judgments and actions. Furthermore, I suggest distinguishing three kinds of opacity: 1) the subjects do not know what the system does (\"shallow opacity\"), 2) the analysts do not know what the system does (\"standard black box opacity\"), or 3) the analysts cannot possibly know what the system might do (\"deep opacity\"). If the agents, data subjects as well as analytics experts, operate under opacity, then these agents cannot provide justifications for judgments that are necessary to protect privacy, e.g., they cannot give \"informed consent\", or guarantee \"anonymity\". It follows from these points that agents in big data analytics and AI often cannot make the judgments needed to protect privacy. So I conclude that big data analytics makes the privacy problems worse and the remedies less effective. As a positive note, I provide a brief outlook on technical ways to handle this situation."}

Building on three pillars - Secure Software Development, Functional Requirements, and Ethics & Data Privacy - the catalog translates the high-level obligations of the EU AI Act into specific, testable criteria.

Using backward design principles, we created a four-hour workshop where two students designed applications addressing authentic EFL writing challenges. We adopted a case study methodology, collecting data from worksheets and video recordings, think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, and AI-generated images.

When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions. Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated task."}

Large language models (LLMs) are promising for bridging this gap, but interactions between students and LLMs are rarely overseen by educators. We developed and studied an LLM-powered course assistant deployed across multiple computer science courses to characterize real-world use and understand pedagogical implications. By Spring 2024, our system had been deployed to approximately 2,000 students across six courses at three institutions. Analysis of the interaction data shows that usage remains strong in the evenings and nights and is higher in introductory courses, indicating that our system helps address temporal support gaps and novice learner needs. We sampled 200 conversations per course for manual annotation: most sampled responses were judged correct and helpful, with a small share unhelpful or erroneous; few responses included dedicated examples. We also examined an inquiry-based learning strategy: only around 11% of sampled conversations contained LLM-generated follow-up questions, which were often ignored by students in advanced courses. A Bloom's taxonomy analysis reveals that current LLM capabilities are limited in generating higher-order cognitive questions. These patterns suggest opportunities for pedagogically oriented LLM-based educational systems and greater educator involvement in configuring prompts, content, and policies."}

Applied to the matrix version of the Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex, it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{T\\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{T\\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret, $I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\\cdot||\\cdot)$ denotes the quantum relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is ``free''.Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA problem, based on the imaginary error function.Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states.

We present STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure, avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across 10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact of specific interactions within our experimental scope."}

Despite demonstrated efficacy in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans.

While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries.To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps, deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization. Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack. Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the defenses.

If the full word (\"Bonham\") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and predict multiple steps at once.

The factored representation of both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL, with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online planning algorithm Prost.

However, the inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study, we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image translation to generate artificially stained slices from synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms, producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation. While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative, label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research."}

Although histopathologic examination remains the diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved 96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89% AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07% precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.

Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged, MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information. This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities, and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple, thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI, DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training, while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts (MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability.

We study a specific type of self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour.

We reveal that numerical optimization-based prompt recovery methods are fundamentally limited as they do not account for the initial random noise used during image generation. We identify and exploit a noise-generation vulnerability (CWE-339), prevalent in major image-generation frameworks, originating from PyTorch's restriction of seed values to a range of $2^{32}$ when generating the initial random noise on CPUs.

It argues for their recognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for jurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's key digital regulations.

We developed a data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast, and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest variability.

However, it suffers from rapid loss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into local optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address the shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance learning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three strategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning strategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population diversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the bootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the tendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early search stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the hard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the weighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search ability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is proposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the stagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus enhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed MRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test set, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the Friedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The results show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic RIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence speed and stability."}

Nonetheless, ECO faces constraints due to an imbalance between exploitation and exploration, rendering it susceptible to local optima and demonstrating restricted effectiveness in addressing complex optimization problems. To address these limitations, this study presents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing multi-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance learning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO. Each operator effectively balances exploitation and exploration while preventing premature convergence of the population. The effectiveness of IECO is assessed through benchmark functions derived from the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 test suites, and its performance is compared with various basic and improved algorithms across different categories. The results demonstrate that IECO-MCO surpasses the basic ECO and other competing algorithms in convergence speed, stability, and the capability to avoid local optima. Furthermore, statistical analyses, including the Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test, are conducted to validate the superiority of IECO-MCO over the compared algorithms. Compared with the basic algorithm (improved algorithm), IECO-MCO achieved an average ranking of 2.213 (2.488) on the CE2017 and CEC2022 test suites. Additionally, the practical applicability of the proposed IECO-MCO algorithm is verified by solving constrained optimization problems.

Deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks. Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification.

While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories, enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding."}

This is typically achieved through an \"image-relative\" approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we present a new paradigm of learning \"object-relative\" control that exhibits several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric map representation in the form of a \"relative\" 3D scene graph, which is used to obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a local controller, dubbed \"ObjectReact\", conditioned directly on a high-level \"WayObject Costmap\" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction.

Most existing unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios. Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language representations."}

Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer (prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts."}

Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action planning of VLA?

We formalize curiosity with signals from both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.

Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution.

To address the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX model with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x."}

Unlike standard policy gradient methods that rely on high-variance score-function estimators, HDPO computes gradients by differentiating through the known system dynamics. Via extensive benchmarking, we show that HDPO recovers near-optimal policies in settings with known or bounded optima, is more robust than variants of the REINFORCE algorithm, and significantly outperforms generalized newsvendor heuristics on problems using real time series data. Our second technique aligns neural policy architectures with the topology of the inventory network. We exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a natural inductive bias for encoding supply chain structure, demonstrate that they can represent optimal and near-optimal policies in two theoretical settings, and empirically show that they reduce data requirements across six diverse inventory problems.

Instead of designing algorithms by hand, one can learn aggregation rules, particularly voting rules, from data. However, prior work in this area has required extremely large models or been limited by the choice of preference representation, i.e., embedding. We recast the problem of designing voting rules with desirable properties into one of learning probabilistic functions that output distributions over a set of candidates. Specifically, we use neural networks to learn probabilistic social choice functions. Using standard embeddings from the social choice literature we show that preference profile encoding has significant impact on the efficiency and ability of neural networks to learn rules, allowing us to learn rules faster and with smaller networks than previous work.

However, these approaches require substantially increased computational resources, with most computation wasted on exploring low-diversity branches where the model already exhibits high confidence. We observe that a small subset of uncertain reasoning steps has a disproportionately large impact on final prediction accuracy, and branching at these points tends to yield higher-quality and more diverse candidate reasoning steps. Therefore, we introduce Entropy-Gated Branching: a novel inference technique that dynamically allocates computational resources by selectively expanding prediction sequences only at points of high uncertainty. Our method leverages entropy as a gating mechanism to identify when branching is most beneficial, coupled with an external feedback model to rank and prune candidate branches. Empirical results on mathematical and financial reasoning benchmarks show that this strategy improves accuracy by 22.6% over standard inference while operating 37% faster than conventional beam search with similar or higher performance. Our results show that dynamic resource allocation during inference can substantially improve both efficiency and effectiveness, offering a more scalable pathway to enhanced LLM reasoning capabilities."}

This method has been widely applied in tasks such as Question Answering (QA). However, existing RAG methods struggle with open-domain QA tasks because they perform independent retrieval operations and directly incorporate the retrieved information into generation without maintaining a summarizing memory or using adaptive retrieval strategies, leading to noise from redundant information and insufficient information integration. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive memory-based optimization for enhanced RAG (Amber) for open-domain QA tasks, which comprises an Agent-based Memory Updater, an Adaptive Information Collector, and a Multi-granular Content Filter, working together within an iterative memory updating paradigm. Specifically, Amber integrates and optimizes the language model's memory through a multi-agent collaborative approach, ensuring comprehensive knowledge integration from previous retrieval steps. It dynamically adjusts retrieval queries and decides when to stop retrieval based on the accumulated knowledge, enhancing retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, it reduces noise by filtering irrelevant content at multiple levels, retaining essential information to improve overall model performance. We conduct extensive experiments on several open-domain QA datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method and its components.

However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called \"Parasite\" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. \"Parasite\" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, \"Parasite\" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code atthis https URL."}

This work proposes VeriLight, a low-overhead and unobtrusive system for protecting speech videos from visual manipulations of speaker identity and lip and facial motion. Unlike the predominant purely digital falsification detection methods, VeriLight creates dynamic physical signatures at the event site and embeds them into all video recordings via imperceptible modulated light. These physical signatures encode semantically-meaningful features unique to the speech event, including the speaker's identity and facial motion, and are cryptographically-secured to prevent spoofing. The signatures can be extracted from any video downstream and validated against the portrayed speech content to check its integrity. Key elements of VeriLight include (1) a framework for generating extremely compact (i.e., 150-bit), pose-invariant speech video features, based on locality-sensitive hashing; and (2) an optical modulation scheme that embeds $>$200 bps into video while remaining imperceptible both in video and live. Experiments on extensive video datasets show VeriLight achieves AUCs $\\geq$ 0.99 and a true positive rate of 100% in detecting falsified videos.

We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction.

Recent developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The models are trained using geometric inputs in the branch network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases.

The resulting datasets span two orthogonal dimensions: task knowledge reliance and conflict plausibility. Evaluating representative open-source LLMs, we find that: (1) performance degradation from conflict correlates with a task's knowledge reliance; (2) explanatory rationales and simple reiteration both increase context reliance-helpful for context-only tasks but harmful when parametric knowledge should dominate; (3) These behaviors raise concerns about the validity of model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge conflict in the deployment of LLMs."}

Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement (i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity. To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models.

This paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL) theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query collision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the transformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention window threshold (CWT). To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt.

Urban", "title": "Data-Augmented Few-Shot Neural Stencil Emulation for System Identification of Computer Models", "abstract": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the modeling of many natural and engineered systems. It can be convenient to express such models as neural PDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or all of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation. Neural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for uncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually trained on solution trajectories obtained by long time integration of the PDE solver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for generating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling sampling of local \"stencil\" states. This approach removes a large degree of spatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states that may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state space. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned from synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10 timesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we assume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model, which is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show that our data-augmented synthetic stencil data yield better trained neural stencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled stencil data from simulation trajectories."}

This paper provides an integrated perspective on generative diffusion by connecting their dynamic, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic properties under a unified mathematical framework. We demonstrate that the rate of conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the generative bandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the score function's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the branching of trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis offers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by the controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks in information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible outcomes. The score function acts as a dynamic non-linear filter that regulates the bandwidth of the noise by suppressing fluctuations that are incompatible with the data."}

To help address this issue, we introduce natural monologues, which are composed by continuous sentences and waiting intervals, mimicking humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. We find a proper training paradigm to be critical for semantically aligning natural monologues with audio. To this end, we develop a dual training paradigm that alternates the position of the monologues, either leading or trailing the audio, across different training stages. A combination of our natural monologue and dual training strategy is applied in developing FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog chatbot with native full-duplexity.

Wolfe,Alice Choe,Fergus Kidd", "title": "The Architecture of AI Transformation: Four Strategic Patterns and an Emerging Frontier", "abstract": "Despite extensive investment in artificial intelligence, 95% of enterprises report no measurable profit impact from AI deployments (MIT, 2025). In this theoretical paper, we argue that this gap reflects paradigmatic lock-in that channels AI into incremental optimization rather than structural transformation. Using a cross-case analysis, we propose a 2x2 framework that reconceptualizes AI strategy along two independent dimensions: the degree of transformation achieved (incremental to transformational) and the treatment of human contribution (reduced to amplified). The framework surfaces four patterns now dominant in practice: individual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and a less deployed frontier of collaborative intelligence. Evidence shows that the first three dimensions reinforce legacy work models and yield localized gains without durable value capture. Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms: complementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution (mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human determination of ethical and strategic parameters). Complementarity and boundary-setting are observable in regulated and high-stakes domains; co-evolution is largely absent, which helps explain limited system-level impact. Our findings in a case study analysis illustrated that advancing toward collaborative intelligence requires material restructuring of roles, governance, and data architecture rather than additional tools. The framework reframes AI transformation as an organizational design challenge: moving from optimizing the division of labor between humans and machines to architecting their convergence, with implications for operating models, workforce development, and the future of work."}

This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation (abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced, including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class.

While existing enhancement approaches require additional training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance, achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models.

This manual approach is often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing sensitive clinical data.

Specifically, a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention module models global dependencies with syntax-guided masking, while a Semantic Optimal Transport Attention module formulates aspect-opinion association as a distribution matching problem solved via the Sinkhorn algorithm. An Adaptive Attention Fusion mechanism balances heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization enhances robustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (Rest14, Laptop14, and Twitter) demonstrate that OTESGN delivers state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it surpasses competitive baselines by up to +1.30 Macro-F1 on Laptop14 and +1.01 on Twitter. Ablation studies and visualization analyses further highlight OTESGN's ability to capture fine-grained sentiment associations and suppress noise from irrelevant context."}

Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B, QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly.

By leveraging contextual embeddings to create contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items, this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data.

While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate.

Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone. Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5% YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue (17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.

The library implements a modular pipeline covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized), incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model predictivity.

This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem, using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models (LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology. Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1) internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation, co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic, cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological classifications.

Existing detection approaches, such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time, unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g., pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility), allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments."}

In this work, we propose GrACE, a Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks, outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation."}

Unlike previous work that evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions: low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines.

To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses.

To address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories, enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding."}

To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training process.

In theory, the combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers. With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other methods, which may be of independent interest."}

To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL. Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM failure modes."}

Previous methods mainly focus on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors, and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly outperforms strong policy gradient baselines.

We study a specific type of self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour.

Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness, prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a compact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to 25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines."}

Quantization reduces memory through lower numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, using computational invariance: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Wx} = (\\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\\mathbf{Q}$. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $\\mu = 1/\\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\\{+1, -1\\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \\log n)$ computational complexity with only $\\frac{n \\log n}{2}$ learnable parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to quantization.

However, these approaches require substantially increased computational resources, with most computation wasted on exploring low-diversity branches where the model already exhibits high confidence. We observe that a small subset of uncertain reasoning steps has a disproportionately large impact on final prediction accuracy, and branching at these points tends to yield higher-quality and more diverse candidate reasoning steps. Therefore, we introduce Entropy-Gated Branching: a novel inference technique that dynamically allocates computational resources by selectively expanding prediction sequences only at points of high uncertainty. Our method leverages entropy as a gating mechanism to identify when branching is most beneficial, coupled with an external feedback model to rank and prune candidate branches. Empirical results on mathematical and financial reasoning benchmarks show that this strategy improves accuracy by 22.6% over standard inference while operating 37% faster than conventional beam search with similar or higher performance. Our results show that dynamic resource allocation during inference can substantially improve both efficiency and effectiveness, offering a more scalable pathway to enhanced LLM reasoning capabilities."}

We use causal interventions to identify information flow in Gemma-2 2B for five naturalistic ICL tasks. We find that the model infers task information using a two-step strategy we call contextualize-then-aggregate: In the lower layers, the model builds up representations of individual fewshot examples, which are contextualized by preceding examples through connections between fewshot input and output tokens across the sequence. In the higher layers, these representations are aggregated to identify the task and prepare prediction of the next output. The importance of the contextualization step differs between tasks, and it may become more important in the presence of ambiguous examples.

This paper introduces the Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG), an ontology-driven framework designed to overcome these limitations by explicitly modeling the formal structure and diachronic nature of legal norms. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors.

Since the choice of in-context information can be determined based on the problem itself, in-context learning is analogous to human learning from teachers in a classroom. Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that ICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's (LLM) ability to predict required skills to solve a problem, popularly referred to as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct necessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the model's responses. On 5-shot evaluations across popular math benchmarks and five SLMs (1B--7B; Qwen, Llama), AdaptMI+ improves accuracy by up to 6% over naive skill-based strategies."}

These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its comparatively smaller model size.

However, effectively aligning these modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets, human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs."}

To help address this issue, we introduce natural monologues, which are composed by continuous sentences and waiting intervals, mimicking humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. We find a proper training paradigm to be critical for semantically aligning natural monologues with audio. To this end, we develop a dual training paradigm that alternates the position of the monologues, either leading or trailing the audio, across different training stages. A combination of our natural monologue and dual training strategy is applied in developing FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog chatbot with native full-duplexity.

Implicit representations, such as SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel- or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations, overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.

Given the high cost of MRI acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses, particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches. Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.

The multi-task learning approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%, outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by 2.75%."}

To promote the progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a 24.73% improvement.

In this paper, we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy. Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t. absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video benchmarks.

Prior approaches face critical limitations: some rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each task."}

Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged, MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information. This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities, and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple, thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI, DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training, while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

However, current clinical practices for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation, subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding, limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data.

Specifically, the non-strict spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns, i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.

Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models. Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images.

However, these two components are not independent. Global movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn, driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics, while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement. Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter, improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and data are available at the project pagethis https URL."}

To tackle this problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct benchmark datasets.

Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction. The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone (e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies.

Deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks. Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid, fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization.

The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance.

To implement this, we propose UAE, a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation, where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and generation fidelity.

Recent work has attempted to characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models, proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural image datasets.

Traditional display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion, homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function as precise display measurement instruments.

Although deep learning-based methods show promise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in mobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory footprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks at varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and accuracy.Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter signal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods. Next, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image resolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations (FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold reduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable performance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and mean-square-error (MSE). Specifically, the MAPE decreased to 3.85% compared to 4.42%, and the MSE decreased to 1.34 \\times 10^{-2} compared to 2.01 \\times 10^{-2}. Inference time and GPU memory usage were reduced by factors of 16 and 12, respectively. Further experiments comparing scatter-corrected reconstructions on a large, simulated dataset and real CBCT scans from water and Sedentex CT phantoms clearly demonstrated the robustness of our method.Conclusion: This study highlights the underappreciated role of downsampling in deep learning-based scatter estimation.

We study this limitation through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors, highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor. These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning."}

In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments. Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end, we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning. Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.

Methods: We utilized a publicly available longitudinal OCT dataset at five stages (preoperative, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). A stage specific segmentation model delineated related structures, and an automated pipeline extracted quantitative, composite, qualitative, and dynamic features. Binary logistic regression models, constructed with and without dynamic parameters, assessed their incremental predictive value for best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). A multimodal DL model combining clinical variables, OCT-derived features, and raw OCT images was developed and benchmarked against regression models. Results: The segmentation model achieved high accuracy across all timepoints (mean Dice > 0.89). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified base diameter, ellipsoid zone integrity, and macular hole area as significant BCVA predictors (P < 0.05). Incorporating dynamic recovery rates consistently improved logistic regression AUC, especially at the 3-month follow-up. The multimodal DL model outperformed logistic regression, yielding higher AUCs and overall accuracy at each stage. The difference is as high as 0.12, demonstrating the complementary value of raw image volume and dynamic parameters. Conclusions: Integrating dynamic parameters into the multimodal DL model significantly enhances the accuracy of predictions.

Within digital pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study, we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image translation to generate artificially stained slices from synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms, producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation. While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need for further training data and refinement.

Recently, neural network-based ILF schemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate for next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural networks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high demands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To address this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up tables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF, all possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached into LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by simply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and interpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference computations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework, termed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of filtering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable better filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second, we propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of different color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution practical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the LUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution.

We developed a data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast, and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest variability.

This is typically achieved through an \"image-relative\" approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we present a new paradigm of learning \"object-relative\" control that exhibits several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across both training-testing and mapping-execution settings.

We propose a novel graph alignment framework that simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.

Discrete codec representations have been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness, prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control.

Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for strongerthis http URLis publicly available atthis https URL."}

The perception unit includes three synchronised global shutter colour cameras, an automotive 3D LiDAR scanner, and an inertial sensor - all precisely calibrated. We also establish benchmarks for tasks involving localisation, reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis, which enable the evaluation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) methods, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) methods as well as radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To evaluate 3D reconstruction the TLS 3D models are used as ground truth. Localisation ground truth is computed by registering the mobile LiDAR scans to the TLS 3D models. Radiance field methods are evaluated not only with poses sampled from the input trajectory, but also from viewpoints that are from trajectories which are distant from the training poses. Our evaluation demonstrates a key limitation of state-of-the-art radiance field methods: we show that they tend to overfit to the training poses/images and do not generalise well to out-of-sequence poses. They also underperform in 3D reconstruction compared to MVS systems using the same visual inputs. Our dataset and benchmarks are intended to facilitate better integration of radiance field methods and SLAM systems.

Although 3D-GS shows effectiveness in static scenes, their performance significantly degrades in real-world environments due to transient objects, lighting variations, and diverse levels of occlusion. To tackle this, existing methods estimate occluders or transient elements by leveraging pre-trained models or integrating additional transient field pipelines. However, these methods still suffer from two defects: 1) Using semantic features from the Vision Foundation model (VFM) causes additional computational costs. 2) The transient field requires significant memory to handle transient elements with per-view Gaussians and struggles to define clear boundaries for occluders, solely relying on photometric errors. To address these problems, we propose ForestSplats, a novel approach that leverages the deformable transient field and a superpixel-aware mask to efficiently represent transient elements in the 2D scene across unconstrained image collections and effectively decompose static scenes from transient distractors without VFM. We designed the transient field to be deformable, capturing per-view transient elements. Furthermore, we introduce a superpixel-aware mask that clearly defines the boundaries of occluders by considering photometric errors and superpixels. Additionally, we propose uncertainty-aware densification to avoid generating Gaussians within the boundaries of occluders during densification. Through extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that ForestSplats outperforms existing methods without VFM and shows significant memory efficiency in representing transient elements."}

However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called \"Parasite\" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. \"Parasite\" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, \"Parasite\" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks.

This work proposes VeriLight, a low-overhead and unobtrusive system for protecting speech videos from visual manipulations of speaker identity and lip and facial motion. Unlike the predominant purely digital falsification detection methods, VeriLight creates dynamic physical signatures at the event site and embeds them into all video recordings via imperceptible modulated light. These physical signatures encode semantically-meaningful features unique to the speech event, including the speaker's identity and facial motion, and are cryptographically-secured to prevent spoofing. The signatures can be extracted from any video downstream and validated against the portrayed speech content to check its integrity. Key elements of VeriLight include (1) a framework for generating extremely compact (i.e., 150-bit), pose-invariant speech video features, based on locality-sensitive hashing; and (2) an optical modulation scheme that embeds $>$200 bps into video while remaining imperceptible both in video and live. Experiments on extensive video datasets show VeriLight achieves AUCs $\\geq$ 0.99 and a true positive rate of 100% in detecting falsified videos.

Despite this progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method.

We propose Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence, and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing, a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation.

The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been proposed to learn effective latent representations, generated images often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions, due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information during optimization, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure. Moreover, we integrate our frequency-preserving latent embeddings into a SOTA latent diffusion model, resulting in sharper and more realistic image generation.

To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state.

Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to incorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the depth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform texture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. A key contribution of this work is a novel method to quantify the epistemic uncertainty of the lidar-visual NeRF reconstruction by estimating the spatial variance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor observations from the cameras and lidar. This provides a principled approach to evaluate the contribution of each sensor modality to the final reconstruction. In this way, reconstructions that are uncertain (due to e.g. uniform visual texture, limited observation viewpoints, or little lidar coverage) can be identified and removed. Our system is integrated with a real-time lidar SLAM system which is used to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction procedure. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which is essential for the lidar depth loss. The refined SLAM trajectory can then be divided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible images together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual reconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Our uncertainty estimation is particularly effective when merging submaps as their boundaries often contain artefacts due to limited observations.

Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations."}

Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy transformer/Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) decoders that strain memory and stability. To address these limitations, we propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight architecture featuring a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder for rich feature extraction and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder that uses linear-time state-space blocks for efficient long-range spatial modelling. We frame the goal of this work as establishing a new state of the art in the spatial fidelity of single-volume reconstruction, a foundational prerequisite for the ultimate aim of generating temporally coherent fMRI time series. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings. The code is available atthis https URL."}

Many methods address complex spectral variability; yet large-scale distortions to the scale of the observed pixel signatures due to topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major challenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate model fitting. Because of this, correcting these variations can offer significant advantages in real-world GIS applications. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that corrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By estimating and correcting these distortions to the scale of the pixel signatures, the algorithm produces pixel signatures with minimal distortions in scale. Since these distortions in scale (which hinder the performance of many unmixing methods) are greatly minimized in the output provided by the proposed method, the abundance estimation of the unmixing algorithms is significantly improved. We present a rigorous mathematical framework to describe and correct for scale variability and provide extensive experimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's impact is evaluated across a wide range of state-of-the-art unmixing methods on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed preprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms, achieving error reductions of around 50%, even for algorithms specifically designed to handle spectral variability. This demonstrates that scale correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing with existing methods. The algorithm's generality, consistent impact, and significant influence highlight its potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines. The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication."}

Applied to the matrix version of the Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex, it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{T\\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{T\\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret, $I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\\cdot||\\cdot)$ denotes the quantum relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is ``free''.Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA problem, based on the imaginary error function.Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states.

To address this challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption, the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is unavoidable.Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool that might be of independent interest.

We first quantify the emission savings of a carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training rounds to lower-carbon periods.

This scoping review synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii) evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii) identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly dynamic and decentralized power systems."}

We present STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure, avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across 10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact of specific interactions within our experimental scope."}

However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities.

Qureshi,Husheng Li", "title": "Continuous-Time Value Iteration for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i) conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and (ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo.

Automating peering partner selection can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.

The XGBoost model trained with publicly available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in predicting peering partners.

Previous methods mainly focus on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors, and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to find more predictable solution paths.

We attempt to address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models, such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data. This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts (MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.

Our approach provides significant advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer."}

We study a specific type of self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour.

Geostatistics leverages the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon, clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30% compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in precision agriculture."}

However, these algorithms typically analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments (Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in cross-environment (All) scenarios."}

Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration (PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and distributional fidelity.

Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters, efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while maintaining privacy. Our code is available here."}

We propose a novel graph alignment framework that simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring consistent geometric relationships across different representations.

To counter this, we propose decentralising alignment through three characteristics: context, pluralism, and participation. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the critical importance of delineating the context-of-use when shaping alignment practices by grounding each of these features in concrete use cases. This work makes the following contributions: (1) highlighting the role of context, pluralism, and participation in decentralising alignment; (2) providing concrete examples to illustrate these strategies; and (3) demonstrating the nuanced requirements associated with applying alignment across different contexts of use. Ultimately, this paper positions LLM alignment as a potential site of resistance against epistemic injustice and the erosion of democratic processes, while acknowledging that these strategies alone cannot substitute for broader societal changes."}

Strain analysis informed with the orientation of fibers allows to describe several pathologies that are typically associated with impaired mechanics of the myocardium, such as cardiovascular disease. Several methods have been developed to estimate strain-derived metrics from traditional imaging techniques. However, the physical models underlying these methods do not include fiber mechanics, restricting their capacity to accurately explain cardiac function. In this work, we introduce WarpPINN-fibers, a physics-informed neural network framework to accurately obtain cardiac motion and strains enhanced by fiber information. We train our neural network to satisfy a hyper-elastic model and promote fiber contraction with the goal to predict the deformation field of the heart from cine magnetic resonance images. For this purpose, we build a loss function composed of three terms: a data-similarity loss between the reference and the warped template images, a regularizer enforcing near-incompressibility of cardiac tissue and a fiber-stretch penalization that controls strain in the direction of synthetically produced fibers. We show that our neural network improves the former WarpPINN model and effectively controls fiber stretch in a synthetic phantom experiment. Then, we demonstrate that WarpPINN-fibers outperforms alternative methodologies in landmark-tracking and strain curve prediction for a cine-MRI benchmark with a cohort of 15 healthy volunteers. We expect that our method will enable a more precise quantification of cardiac strains through accurate deformation fields that are consistent with fiber physiology, without requiring imaging techniques more sophisticated than MRI."}

Recent attempts to accelerate FWI using learned wavefield neural operators have shown promise in efficiency and differentiability, but typically suffer from noisy and unstable inversion performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel physics-informed FWI framework to enhance the inversion in accuracy while maintaining the efficiency of neural operator-based FWI. Instead of relying only on the L2 norm objective function via automatic differentiation, resulting in noisy model reconstruction, we integrate a physics constraint term in the loss function of FWI, improving the quality of the inverted velocity models. Specifically, starting with an initial model to simulate wavefields and then evaluating the loss over how much the resulting wavefield obeys the physical laws (wave equation) and matches the recorded data, we achieve a reduction in noise and artifacts. Numerical experiments using the OpenFWI and Overthrust models demonstrate our method's superior performance, offering cleaner and more accurate subsurface velocity than vanilla approaches.

Although prior studies have explored the causes and detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions during training.

Dividing a large graph into smaller subgraphs facilitates complex system analysis by revealing local information.

Structure based community detection methods are more suitable for applying to graphs because they do not rely heavily on rich node or edge attribute information. The features derived from these communities can improve downstream graph mining tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. In real-world applications, we often lack ground truth community information. Additionally, there is neither a universally accepted gold standard for community detection nor a single method that is consistently optimal across diverse applications.

Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns, i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data. These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled. Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space. Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available inthis https URL."}

In effect, such architectures state how the database records and links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash, Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation."}

We developed a data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast, and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest variability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the optimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in water exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid optimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes without loss of parameter fidelity. This approach supports the broader application of exchange-sensitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in neuroscience and clinical research, and offers a generalizable method for designing efficient acquisition protocols in biophysical parameter mapping."}

This is typically achieved through an \"image-relative\" approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we present a new paradigm of learning \"object-relative\" control that exhibits several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric map representation in the form of a \"relative\" 3D scene graph, which is used to obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a local controller, dubbed \"ObjectReact\", conditioned directly on a high-level \"WayObject Costmap\" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction.

Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action planning of VLA?

We formalize curiosity with signals from both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.

In this paper, we propose a novel data-efficient architecture, \\textit{Gaussian-activated Linear model (GLinear)}, for multivariate TSF that exploits periodic patterns to provide better accuracy. It achieves higher prediction accuracy while requiring less historical data than other state-of-the-art linear predictors.

This challenge is intensified by the slowdown in CMOS scaling.Analog computing presents a promising alternative, offering substantial improvements in energy efficiency by directly manipulating physical quantities such as current, voltage, charge, or photons. However, it is inherently vulnerable to manufacturing variations, nonlinearities, and noise, leading to degraded prediction accuracy. One of the most effective techniques for enhancing robustness, Noisy Training, introduces noise during the training phase to reinforce the model against disturbances encountered during inference. Although highly effective, its performance degrades in real-world environments where noise characteristics fluctuate due to external factors such as temperature variations and temporal drift.This study underscores the necessity of Noisy Training while revealing its fundamental limitations in the presence of dynamic noise. To address these challenges, we propose Variance-Aware Noisy Training, a novel approach that mitigates performance degradation by incorporating noise schedules which emulate the evolving noise conditions encountered during inference.

However, in asynchronous FL settings-which inherently face three major challenges: asynchronous delay, data heterogeneity, and flexible client participation-the complex interactions among these system/statistical constraints and compression/EF mechanisms remain poorly understood theoretically. There is a significant lack of systematic convergence analysis that adequately captures these complex couplings. In this paper, we fill this gap by analyzing the convergence behaviors of FL under different frameworks. We first consider a basic asynchronous FL framework AsynFL, and establish an improved convergence analysis that relies on fewer assumptions and yields a superior convergence rate than prior studies. Then, we consider a variant framework with gradient compression, AsynFLC. We derive sufficient conditions for its convergence, indicating the nonlinear interaction between asynchronous delay and compression rate. Our analysis further demonstrates how asynchronous delay and data heterogeneity jointly amplify compression-induced errors, thereby hindering convergence. Furthermore, we study the convergence of AsynFLC-EF, the framework that further integrates EF. We prove that EF can effectively reduce the variance of gradient estimation despite asynchronous delays, which enables AsynFLC-EF to match the convergence rate of AsynFL. We also show that the impact of asynchronous delay and flexible participation on EF is limited to slowing down the higher-order convergence term. Experimental results substantiate our analytical findings very well."}

This paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL) theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query collision case.

To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt.

We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance.

This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation (abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced, including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios."}

CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities, including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined biochemical graphs, into a unified multimodal representation.

To improve optimization stability and generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training.

A central element of this process is the patient summary, typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon, or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs."}

During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs; Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) - (1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision in our proposed Information Tinker.

Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model prompting.

While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB) to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions. Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with small additional communication and computational demands. This extension solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings.

Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and weight-space merging of the resulting student variants.

Besides, MoT consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students."}

As Social Choice Theory has shown, the problem of designing aggregation rules with specific sets of properties (axioms) can be difficult, or provably impossible in some cases. Instead of designing algorithms by hand, one can learn aggregation rules, particularly voting rules, from data. However, prior work in this area has required extremely large models or been limited by the choice of preference representation, i.e., embedding. We recast the problem of designing voting rules with desirable properties into one of learning probabilistic functions that output distributions over a set of candidates. Specifically, we use neural networks to learn probabilistic social choice functions. Using standard embeddings from the social choice literature we show that preference profile encoding has significant impact on the efficiency and ability of neural networks to learn rules, allowing us to learn rules faster and with smaller networks than previous work. Moreover, we show that our learned rules can be fine-tuned using axiomatic properties to create novel voting rules and make them resistant to specific types of \"attack\".

The approach combines the Laplace-Beltrami framework for image denoising and enhancement, introduced by Sochen, Kimmel and Malladi about 25 years ago, and the assignment flow approach introduced and studied by the authors.The sigma flow arises as Riemannian gradient flow of generalized harmonic energies and thus is governed by a nonlinear geometric PDE which determines a harmonic map from a closed Riemannian domain manifold to a statistical manifold, equipped with the Fisher-Rao metric from information geometry. A specific ingredient of the sigma flow is the mutual dependency of the Riemannian metric of the domain manifold on the evolving state. This makes the approach amenable to machine learning in a specific way, by realizing this dependency through a mapping with compact time-variant parametrization that can be learned from data. Proof of concept experiments demonstrate the expressivity of the sigma flow model and prediction performance.Structural similarities to transformer network architectures and networks generated by the geometric integration of sigma flows are pointed out, which highlights the connection to deep learning and, conversely, may stimulate the use of geometric design principles for structured prediction in other areas of scientific machine learning."}

Previous studies have introduced semiparametric estimators for such functionals in a broad class of DAGs with hidden variables. While these estimators exhibit desirable statistical properties such as double robustness in certain cases, they also face significant limitations. Notably, they encounter substantial computational challenges, particularly involving density estimation and numerical integration for continuous variables, and their estimates may fall outside the parameter space of the target estimand. Additionally, the asymptotic properties of these estimators is underexplored, especially when integrating flexible statistical and machine learning models for nuisance functional estimations. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing novel one-step corrected plug-in and targeted minimum loss-based estimators of causal effects for a class of hidden variable DAGs that go beyond classical back-door and front-door criteria (known as the treatment primal fixability criterion in prior literature). These estimators leverage data-adaptive machine learning algorithms to minimize modeling assumptions while ensuring key statistical properties including double robustness, efficiency, boundedness within the target parameter space, and asymptotic linearity under $L^2(P)$-rate conditions for nuisance functional estimates that yield root-n consistent causal effect estimates.

However, existing neural architectures that support heterogeneous teaming tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Shared-parameter designs prioritize sample efficiency by enabling a single network to be shared across all or a pre-specified subset of robots (via input augmentations), but tend to limit behavioral diversity. In contrast, recent designs employ a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity and expressivity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. Our key insight is that such tradeoffs can be avoided by viewing these design choices as ends of a broad spectrum. Inspired by recent work in transfer and meta learning, and building on prior work in multi-robot task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a soft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to efficiently learn a flexible shared policy that dynamically adapts to each robot post-training. By explicitly encoding the impact of robot capabilities (e.g., speed and payload) on collective behavior, CASH enables zero-shot generalization to unseen robots or team compositions. Our experiments involve multiple heterogeneous tasks, three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL), and SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, we find that CASH generates appropriately-diverse behaviors and consistently outperforms baseline architectures in terms of performance and sample efficiency during both training and zero-shot generalization, all with 60%-80% fewer learnable parameters."}

An effective solution is synthetic discussion simulations using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create initial pilot experiments. We propose design principles based on existing methodologies for synthetic discussion generation. Based on these principles, we propose a simple, generalizable, LLM-driven methodology to prototype the development of LLM facilitators by generating synthetic data without human involvement, and which surpasses current baselines. We use our methodology to test whether current Social Science strategies for facilitation can improve the performance of LLM facilitators. We find that, while LLM facilitators significantly improve synthetic discussions, there is no evidence that the application of these strategies leads to further improvements in discussion quality. In an effort to aid research in the field of facilitation, we release a large, publicly available dataset containing LLM-generated and LLM-annotated discussions using multiple open-source models. This dataset can be used for LLM facilitator finetuning as well as behavioral analysis of current out-of-the-box LLMs in the task. We also release an open-source python framework that efficiently implements our methodology at great scale."}

The performance of an HSS highly depends on the effectiveness of two key policies: (1) the data-placement policy, which determines the best-fit storage device for incoming data, and (2) the data-migration policy, which dynamically rearranges stored data (i.e., prefetches hot data and evicts cold data) across the devices to sustain high HSS performance. Prior works optimize either data placement or data migration in isolation, which leads to suboptimal HSS performance. Unfortunately, no prior work tries to optimize both policies together.Our goal is to design a holistic data-management technique that optimizes both data-placement and data-migration policies to fully exploit the potential of an HSS, and thus significantly improve system performance. We propose Harmonia, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based data-management technique that employs two lightweight autonomous RL agents, a data-placement agent and a data-migration agent, that adapt their policies for the current workload and HSS configuration while coordinating with each other to improve overall HSS performance.We evaluate Harmonia on real HSS configurations with up to four heterogeneous storage devices and seventeen data-intensive workloads. On performance-optimized (cost-optimized) HSS with two storage devices, Harmonia outperforms the best-performing prior approach by 49.5% (31.7%) on average. On an HSS with three (four) devices, Harmonia outperforms the best-performing prior work by 37.0% (42.0%) on average. Harmonia's performance benefits come with low latency (240ns for inference) and storage overheads (206 KiB in DRAM for both RL agents combined). We will open-source Harmonia's implementation to aid future research on HSS."}

By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-task question answering, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of Speaking with Intent over direct generation without explicit intent. Further analysis corroborates the generalizability of SWI under different experimental settings. Moreover, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. The promising results in enhancing LLMs with explicit intents pave a new avenue for boosting LLMs' generation and reasoning abilities with cognitive notions."}

We use causal interventions to identify information flow in Gemma-2 2B for five naturalistic ICL tasks. We find that the model infers task information using a two-step strategy we call contextualize-then-aggregate: In the lower layers, the model builds up representations of individual fewshot examples, which are contextualized by preceding examples through connections between fewshot input and output tokens across the sequence. In the higher layers, these representations are aggregated to identify the task and prepare prediction of the next output.

We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that ACE is secure against attacks from the InjecAgent and Agent Security Bench benchmarks for indirect prompt injection, and our newly introduced attacks.

Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states.

But joint modeling can be fraught with difficulty. We aim to simplify by suggesting a more modular setup, eschewing joint inference but retaining the main JGP themes: (a) learning optimal neighborhood sizes that locally respect manifolds of discontinuity; and (b) a new cluster-based (latent) feature to capture regions of distinct output levels on both sides of the manifold.

We demonstrate that the rate of conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the generative bandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the score function's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the branching of trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis offers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by the controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks in information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible outcomes. The score function acts as a dynamic non-linear filter that regulates the bandwidth of the noise by suppressing fluctuations that are incompatible with the data."}

Our analysis reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information during optimization, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure. Moreover, we integrate our frequency-preserving latent embeddings into a SOTA latent diffusion model, resulting in sharper and more realistic image generation. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware optimization for realistic image synthesis, with broader implications for applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging."}

However, they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive, thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX model with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x."}

However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce significant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence, potentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional'' software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to verify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven, scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify its outputs.To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used it to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong existing agents.

Recent deep-learning based approaches tend to overlook code syntax and detection interpretability, resulting in suboptimal performance.To fill this research gap, we introduce SmartDetector, a novel approach for computing similarity between smart contract functions, explainable at the fine-grained statement level. Technically, SmartDetector decomposes the AST of a smart contract function into a series of smaller statement trees, each reflecting a structural element of the source code. Then, SmartDetector uses a classifier to compute the similarity score of two functions by comparing each pair of their statement trees. To address the infinite hyperparameter space of the classifier, we mathematically derive a cosine-wise diffusion process to efficiently search optimal hyperparameters.

For subject-specific analyses, the anatomy and blood flow of the subject can be captured non-invasively using structural and 4D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), on the other hand, can be used to generate blood flow simulations by solving the Navier-Stokes equations. To generate and analyze subject-specific blood flow simulations, MRI and CFD have to be brought together.Methods: We present an interactive, customizable, and user-oriented visual analysis tool that assists researchers in both medicine and numerical analysis. Our open-source tool is applicable to domains such as CFD and MRI, and it facilitates the analysis of simulation results and medical data, especially in hemodynamic studies. It enables the creation of simulation ensembles with a high variety of parameters. Furthermore, it allows for the visual and analytical examination of simulations and measurements through 2D embeddings of the similarity space.Results: To demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool, we applied it to three real-world use cases, showcasing its ability to configure simulation ensembles and analyse blood flow dynamics. We evaluated our example cases together with MRI and CFD experts to further enhance features and increase the usability.Conclusions: By combining the strengths of both CFD and MRI, our tool provides a more comprehensive understanding of hemodynamic parameters, facilitating more accurate analysis of hemodynamic biomarkers."}

Nguyen,Vu Nguyen", "title": "Toward Generation of Test Cases from Task Descriptions via History-aware Planning", "abstract": "In automated web testing, generating test scripts from natural language task descriptions is crucial for enhancing the test generation process. This activity involves creating the correct sequences of actions to form test scripts for future testing activities. Current state-of-the-art approaches are limited in generating these action sequences, as they either demand substantial manual effort for human demonstrations or fail to consider the history of previous web content and actions to decide the next action. In this paper, we introduce HxAgent, an iterative large language model agent planning approach that determines the next action based on: 1) observations of the current contents and feasible actions, 2) short-term memory of previous web states and actions, and 3) long-term experience with (in)correct action sequences. The agent generates a sequence of actions to perform a given task, which is effectively an automated test case to verify the task. We conducted an extensive empirical evaluation of HxAgent using two datasets. On the MiniWoB++ dataset, our approach achieves 97% exact-match accuracy that is comparable to the best baselines while eliminating the need for human demonstrations required by those methods. For complex tasks requiring navigation through multiple actions and screens, HxAgent achieves an average 82% exact-match. On the second dataset, comprising 350 task instances across seven popular websites, including YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google, HxAgent achieves high performance, with 87% of the action sequences exactly matching the ground truth and a prefix-match of 93%, outperforming the baseline by 59%."}

Nguyen,Vu Nguyen", "title": "Towards Test Generation from Task Description for Mobile Testing with Multi-modal Reasoning", "abstract": "In Android GUI testing, generating an action sequence for a task that can be replayed as a test script is common. Generating sequences of actions and respective test scripts from task goals described in natural language can eliminate the need for manually writing test scripts. However, existing approaches based on large language models (LLM) often struggle with identifying the final action, and either end prematurely or continue past the final screen. In this paper, we introduce VisiDroid, a multi-modal, LLM-based, multi-agent framework that iteratively determines the next action and leverages visual images of screens to detect the task's completeness. The multi-modal approach enhances our model in two significant ways. First, this approach enables it to avoid prematurely terminating a task when textual content alone provides misleading indications of task completion. Additionally, visual input helps the tool avoid errors when changes in the GUI do not directly affect functionality toward task completion, such as adjustments to font sizes or colors. Second, the multi-modal approach also ensures the tool not progress beyond the final screen, which might lack explicit textual indicators of task completion but could display a visual element indicating task completion, which is common in GUI apps. Our evaluation shows that VisiDroid achieves an accuracy of 87.3%, outperforming the best baseline relatively by 23.5%. We also demonstrate that our multi-modal framework with images and texts enables the LLM to better determine when a task is completed."}

Nguyen", "title": "Combining Static and Dynamic Approaches for Mining and Testing Constraints for RESTful API Testing", "abstract": "In API testing, deriving logical constraints on API response bodies is crucial in generating the test cases to cover various aspects of RESTful APIs. However, existing approaches are limited to dynamic analysis in which constraints are extracted from the execution of APIs as part of the system under test. The key limitation of such a dynamic approach is its under-estimation in which inputs in API executions are not sufficiently diverse to uncover actual constraints on API response bodies. In this paper, we propose to combine a novel static analysis approach (in which the constraints for API response bodies are mined from API specifications), with the dynamic approach (which relies on API execution data). We leverage large language models (LLMs) to comprehend the API specifications, mine constraints for response bodies, and generate test cases. To reduce LLMs' hallucination, we apply an Observation-Confirmation (OC) scheme which uses initial prompts to contextualize constraints. %, allowing subsequent prompts to more accurately confirm their presence. Our empirical results show that~LLMs with OC prompting achieve high precision in constraint mining with the average of 91.2%. When combining static and dynamic analysis, our tool, RBCTest , achieves a precision of 78.5%. RBCTest detects 107 constraints that the dynamic approach misses and 46 more precise constraints. We also use its generated test cases to detect 21 mismatches between the API specification and actual response data for 8 real-world APIs. Four of the mismatches were, in fact, reported in developers' forums."}

In practice, all of this is possible but greatly complicated, because human supervision and expert knowledge is needed to set up the execution of algorithms based on their documentation, possibly implicit assumptions, and knowledge about the execution environment and data involved.We derive and formulate a range of detailed requirements from the above goal and from specific use cases, focusing on medical imaging AI algorithms. Furthermore, we refer to a number of existing APIs and implementations and review which aspects each of them addresses, which problems are still open, and which public standards and ontologies may be relevant. Our contribution is a comprehensive collection of aspects that have not yet been addressed in their entirety by any single solution.Working towards the formulated goals should lead to more sustainable algorithm ecosystems and relates to the FAIR principles for research data, where this paper focuses on interoperability and (re)usability of medical imaging AI algorithms."}
