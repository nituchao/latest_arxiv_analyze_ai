This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$.

Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions, establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness and capability in MLLMs."}

Drawing inspiration from Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917 challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise, temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes, particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models. This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems."}

When these opinions form an argumentative structure around forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model (LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before obtaining group forecasting predictions."}

By exploiting results from the database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes \"shP\"-hard when the ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\\exists R.

We prove that intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit tractable WSMS computation."}

However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance. Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient LLM agents."}

However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation."}

In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges, we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in providing memory-inspired responses.

These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate \"relevance judgment,\" shifting the \"locus of epistemic agency\" to non-human systems. Through narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective (democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence: \"infrastructure breakdown methodologies\", experimental approaches that reveal cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after periods of habituation."}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2% of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%; the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians. These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare workforce shortages."}

These channels enable the anonymous trade of illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines, including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird.

By systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection structure.

We address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic.

Two prediction models were developed: a classifier predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error; RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g., ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was developed for embedding extraction.

We address these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e., candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding hallucinations.

In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages, especially the low-resource ones."}

Incorporating a memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents. While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer. During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient, layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations. We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue scenarios."}

We present the first feature-level causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting. Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed. Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting method."}

This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality, coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and (3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements manifest in model activations during reasoning processes.

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability, particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation -> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like \"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the wolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence systems."}

We propose an optimization-based framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings. Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces, primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings.

MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation, maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable and multimodal counterfactual scenarios."}

A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively.

This work introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM), and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements, Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting strategies.

These annotated examples are systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.

Our model imposes constraints of mutual information during the nonlinear mapping process. Specifically, we progressively reduce the mutual information between the input data and the compressed representation while increasing the mutual information between the compressed representation and the output prediction. The design ensures that irrelevant information, which is essentially the noise in the data, is forgotten during the modeling of financial nonlinear relationships without affecting the final asset pricing.

Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However, this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from the incremental perspective.

In this work, we investigate whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost, minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most consistent and accurate segmentations.

However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios."}

This paper presents an integrated navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets, while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods. Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to constraints.

To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13 advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only 21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally, we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios. Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications."}

Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs without altering their original architectures or introducing significant computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture contextualized information even without attending to future tokens. Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared to best-performing methods."}

However, current vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation, we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations. Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings."}

While the majority of research has been focusing on the sequential recommendation task that improves users' feedback in Stage II, there has been little investigation on how to achieve better page navigation in Stage I. To fill this gap, we formally define the task of Personalized Landing Page Modeling (PLPM) into the field of recommender systems: Given a user upon app entry, the goal of PLPM is to proactively select the most suitable landing page from a set of candidates (e.g., functional tabs, content channels, or aggregation pages) to optimize the short-term PDR metric and the long-term user engagement and satisfaction metrics, while adhering to industrial constraints. Additionally, we propose KLAN (Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator), a hierarchical solution framework designed to provide personalized landing pages under the formulation of PLPM. KLAN comprises three key components: (1) KLAN-ISP captures inter-day static page preference; (2) KLAN-IIT captures intra-day dynamic interest transitions and (3) KLAN-AM adaptively integrates both components for optimal navigation decisions. Extensive online experiments conducted on the Kuaishou platform demonstrate the effectiveness of KLAN, obtaining +0.205% and +0.192% improvements on in Daily Active Users (DAU) and user Lifetime (LT).

However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs (teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks that rely on preserving spatial detail."}

By converting VRD datasets into an instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets of varying complexity.

Our findings show that while the models perform well on simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of planning in autonomous robotics."}

Conducting such trials typically demands significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into expressive representations. These representations are then combined with encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration, assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline models."}

With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts. Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns. Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive, artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early intervention."}

To systematically study and mitigate these risk, initiatives like the AI Incident Database (AIID) have emerged, cataloging over 3,000 real-world AI failure reports. Currently, associating a new report with the appropriate AI Incident relies on manual expert intervention, limiting scalability and delaying the identification of emerging failure patterns.To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval-based framework that automates the association of new reports with existing AI Incidents through semantic similarity modeling. We formalize the task as a ranking problem, where each report-comprising a title and a full textual description-is compared to previously documented AI Incidents based on embedding cosine similarity. Benchmarking traditional lexical methods, cross-encoder architectures, and transformer-based sentence embedding models, we find that the latter consistently achieve superior performance. Our analysis further shows that combining titles and descriptions yields substantial improvements in ranking accuracy compared to using titles alone.

However, in videos with complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed FlowGaussian-VR.

Our method, CODA, performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic framework.

These paradigms aim at achieving high energy efficiency by mitigating the Von Neumann bottleneck that relates to the energy cost of moving data between the processing cores and the memory. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are susceptible to this bottleneck, given the massive data they have to manage. Systolic arrays (SAs) are promising architectures to mitigate data transmission cost, thanks to high data utilization of Processing Elements (PEs). These PEs continuously exchange and process data locally based on specific dataflows (such as weight stationary and row stationary), in turn reducing the number of memory accesses to the main memory. In SAs, convolutions are managed either as matrix multiplications or exploiting the raster-order scan of sliding windows. However, data redundancy is a primary concern affecting area, power, and energy. In this paper, we propose TrIM: a novel dataflow for SAs based on a Triangular Input Movement and compatible with CNN computing. TrIM maximizes the local input utilization, minimizes the weight data movement, and solves the data redundancy problem. Furthermore, TrIM does not incur the significant on-chip memory penalty introduced by the row stationary dataflow. When compared to state-of-the-art SA dataflows, the high data utilization offered by TrIM guarantees ~10X less memory access.

This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in increasingly complex real-world applications."}

To achieve this, we propose Hierarchical Agent Reasoning and Information Search (HARIS), explicitly modeling the coordinated process of reasoning-driven searching and search-informed reasoning. HARIS consists of a high-level reasoning agent that focuses on constructing the main verification chain, generating factual questions when more information is needed, and a low-level search agent that iteratively retrieves more information, refining its search based on intermediate findings. This design allows each agent to specialize in its respective task, enhancing verification accuracy and interpretability. HARIS is trained using reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on the EX-FEVER and HOVER benchmarks demonstrate that HARIS achieves strong performance, greatly advancing multi-hop claim verification."}

Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2) models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating formalized and fine-grained logical training."}

Adaptive sensing proactively modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more data and compute.

The core multi-modal conditional encoder-decoder architecture has one modality (optical flow) feed the encoder to produce a collection of latent codes (slots), and the other modality (color image) conditions the decoder to generate the first modality (flow) from the slots. The training criterion is designed to foster 'information separation' among the slots, while the architecture explicitly allocates activations to individual slots, leading to a method we call Divided Attention (DivA). At test time, DivA handles a different number of objects and different image resolution than seen at training, and is invariant to permutations of the slots. DivA achieves state-of-the-art performance while tripling the runtime speed of comparable methods, up to 104 FPS, and reduces the performance gap from supervised methods to 12% or less.

We varied the number of AI-generated examples (none, low, or high exposure) and if the examples were labeled as 'AI' (disclosure). Our dynamic experiment design -- ideas from prior participants in an experimental condition are used as stimuli for future participants in the same experimental condition -- speaks to the interdependent process of cultural creation: creative ideas are built upon prior ideas. Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having LLMs 'in the culture loop'. We find that high AI exposure (but not low AI exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. AI made ideas different, not better. There were no main effects of disclosure.

Grounded in the theory of emotional continuity, SCMM integrates soft contrastive learning with a hybrid masking strategy to effectively capture emotion dynamics (refer to short-term continuity). Specifically, in the self-supervised learning stage, we propose a soft weighting mechanism that assigns similarity scores to sample pairs, enabling fine-grained modeling of emotional transitions and capturing the temporal continuity of human emotions. To further enhance representation learning, we design a similarity-aware aggregator that fuses complementary information from semantically related samples based on pairwise similarities, thereby improving feature expressiveness and reconstruction quality. This dual design contributes to a more discriminative and transferable representation, which is crucial for robust cross-corpus generalization.

Accumulator-aware quantization research has so far only considered the quantization-aware training (QAT) paradigm, in which models are fine-tuned or trained from scratch with quantization in the loop.

Most common RL algorithms use undirected exploration, i.e., select random sequences of actions. Exploration can also be directed using intrinsic rewards, such as curiosity or model epistemic uncertainty. However, effectively balancing task and intrinsic rewards is challenging and often task-dependent. In this work, we introduce a framework, MaxInfoRL, for balancing intrinsic and extrinsic exploration. MaxInfoRL steers exploration towards informative transitions, by maximizing intrinsic rewards such as the information gain about the underlying task. When combined with Boltzmann exploration, this approach naturally trades off maximization of the value function with that of the entropy over states, rewards, and actions. We show that our approach achieves sublinear regret in the simplified setting of multi-armed bandits. We then apply this general formulation to a variety of off-policy model-free RL methods for continuous state-action spaces, yielding novel algorithms that achieve superior performance across hard exploration problems and complex scenarios such as visual control tasks."}

Significant differences emerged across configurations. CUDA execution provider configurations outperformed CPU execution provider configurations in both energy consumption and execution time. Among the configurations, TORCH paired with CUDA demonstrated the greatest energy efficiency, achieving energy savings from 37.99% up to 89.16% compared to other serving configurations.

Machine learning is now an established approach for photometric redshift estimation, with generally acknowledged higher performance in areas with a high density of spectroscopically identified galaxies over template-based methods. Multiple works have shown that image-based convolutional neural networks can outperform tabular-based color/magnitude models. In comparison to tabular models, image models have additional design complexities: it is largely unknown how to fuse inputs from different instruments which have different resolutions or noise properties. The Mantis Shrimp model estimates the conditional density estimate of redshift using cutout images. The density estimates are well calibrated and the point estimates perform well in the distribution of available spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with (bias = 1e-2), scatter (NMAD = 2.44e-2) and catastrophic outlier rate ($\\eta$=17.53$\\%$). We find that early fusion approaches (e.g., resampling and stacking images from different instruments) match the performance of late fusion approaches (e.g., concatenating latent space representations), so that the design choice ultimately is left to the user. Finally, we study how the models learn to use information across bands, finding evidence that our models successfully incorporates information from all surveys. The applicability of our model to the analysis of large populations of galaxies is limited by the speed of downloading cutouts from external servers; however, our model could be useful in smaller studies such as generating priors over redshift for stellar population synthesis."}

In this work, we introduce a novel upper-bound training scheme that employs masking to identify the lowest-energy folds in two-dimensional Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) lattice protein folding.

Despite growing interest in surgical video segmentation, annotation protocols vary widely across datasets -- some provide dense, frame-by-frame labels, while others rely on sparse annotations sampled at low frame rates such as 1 FPS. In this study, we investigate how such inconsistencies in annotation density and frame rate sampling influence the evaluation of zero-shot segmentation models, using SAM2 as a case study for cholecystectomy procedures. Surprisingly, we find that under conventional sparse evaluation settings, lower frame rates can appear to outperform higher ones due to a smoothing effect that conceals temporal inconsistencies. However, when assessed under real-time streaming conditions, higher frame rates yield superior segmentation stability, particularly for dynamic objects like surgical graspers. To understand how these differences align with human perception, we conducted a survey among surgeons, nurses, and machine learning engineers and found that participants consistently preferred high-FPS segmentation overlays, reinforcing the importance of evaluating every frame in real-time applications rather than relying on sparse sampling strategies. Our findings highlight the risk of evaluation bias that is introduced by inconsistent dataset protocols and bring attention to the need for temporally fair benchmarking in surgical video AI."}

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories.

Through collision gradient-guided denoising, the model rectifies artifacts while preserving natural spatial relationships between hands.

However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination.

To address this, we adapt the proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs' ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information, suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content during retrieval."}

Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs, prompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim representation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review examines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and practitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review methodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024 investigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary prompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming, self-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential for reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias types. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to prompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques, creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes while maintaining model utility."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems.

To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based framework that integrates time-frequency joint modeling for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory into raw time sequences and frequency components, and employ dynamic patch partitioning to perform multi-scale segmentation, capturing hierarchical motion patterns. Each patch undergoes adaptive embedding with scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of the two branches are further enhanced via cross-modal attention, facilitating complementary fusion of temporal and spectral cues. The resulting enhanced embeddings exhibit strong expressive power, enabling accurate predictions even when using a vanilla Transformer architecture.

Our framework H2Tune consists of three key components: (i) sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden dimensions across clients through constructing rank-consistent middle matrices, with adaptive sparsification based on client resources; (ii) relation-guided matrix layer alignment to handle heterogeneous layer structures and representation capabilities; and (iii) alternating task-knowledge disentanglement mechanism to decouple shared and specific knowledge of local model parameters through alternating optimization. Theoretical analysis proves a convergence rate of O(1/\\sqrt{T}). Extensive experiments show our method achieves up to 15.4% accuracy improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

In this paper, we present \\textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios.

These channels enable the anonymous trade of illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines, including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of 0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection."}

We address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus of real and synthetic financial news.

Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107 two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials fromthis http URLwith structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error; RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g., ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model (ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a higher proportion of patients with SAEs.

Furthermore, the resources invested into producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e., candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding hallucinations.

The Impact of Translation Strategies in Cross-lingual LLM Prompting", "abstract": "Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems, knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios, two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages, especially the low-resource ones."}

Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments, independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between entities in a document-level setting.

ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy."}

However, constrained by domain-specific knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.) and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.).

Contributors provided at least 20 reports with associated metadata including anatomical region, imaging modality, clinical context, and for non-English reports, English translations. All reports were assigned ICD-10 codes. A human vs. AI report differentiation study was conducted with 154 participants (radiologists, healthcare professionals, and non-healthcare professionals) assessing whether reports were human-authored or AI-generated.

This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality, coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and (3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively.

To capture temporal dynamics from the time series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated on a real-world oncology dataset from the Léon Bérard Center corpus, with a C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort.

These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by 40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of find-ings derived from database studies."}

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability, particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation -> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like \"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the wolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence systems."}

Human voice interactions are inherently more complex than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue.

In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads.

These annotated examples are systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans. Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language understanding.

First, we analyze user feedback in the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench). We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations."}

Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial for enhancing system robustness and performance.

In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble methods by a substantial margin.

Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs, aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and execution speed up of up to $2.59$X.

To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning.

Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs without altering their original architectures or introducing significant computational overhead.

Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared to best-performing methods."}

T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution, providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\\% in targeted domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its performance under adversarial conditions.

Three non-medical volunteers used our AI system to assess ten simulated stroke patients, including cases with likely large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes and stroke-like conditions, while we measured diagnostic accuracy, completion times, user confidence, and expert physician review of the AI-generated reports. The AI system correctly identified 84% of individual stroke signs and detected 75% of likely LVOs, completing evaluations in just over 6 minutes.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2% of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%; the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians. These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare workforce shortages."}

To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan.

Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \\modelname overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web browsing tasks show that \\modelname improves the success of flight search from 0\\% to 32.2\\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent advantage of up to 124\\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA, a web-browsing agent built on \\modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a research demo for public testing."}

Here, we revisit and improve adapters to extend LLMs from three angles: data, architecture and training procedure, which are advantageously considered jointly. The resulting method, called neutral residues, modifies adapters in a way that leads each new residual block to output near-zeros on the original domain. This solution leads to strong results when adapting a state-of-the-art model originally trained on English to a new language.

Our approach harnesses cultural geography across five continents (Africa, America, Asia, Europe, Oceania) through three key steps: First, we synthesize the Pentachromatic Cultural Palette Dataset using GPT-4o, refining continental-level dialogues with Hofstede's cultural dimensions to establish foundational cultural representations. Second, five continent-level alignment agents form specialized cultural communities that generate region-specific draft responses. Third, a Meta Agent employs Cultural MoErges to dynamically blend these cultural \"colors\" through attention-gated parameter merging, akin to mixing pigments on a palette, resolving conflicts while preserving cultural nuances to produce the final culturally-aligned response.

While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first."}

Each instance pairs two equally plausible yet pragmatically divergent continuations and requires the model to (i) infer the speaker's intended meaning and (ii) explain when and why a speaker would choose one utterance over its alternative, thus directly probing pragmatic competence through contrastive reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across 3 key training stages: after pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization, to examine the development of pragmatic competence.

In humans, susceptibility to such interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value updates and queries only the final values.

Structured multi-step pipelines demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques, creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes while maintaining model utility."}

Here, we present a novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations. We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios, introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios. The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment under various speech-specific scenarios.

However, its design and optimizations remain tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose PAPO, a novel policy gradient algorithm that encourages the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason. Specifically, we introduce the Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term, which can be seamlessly plugged into mainstream RLVR algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation, reward models, or stronger teacher models. To further enhance the training stability of PAPO, we introduce the Double Entropy Loss, which effectively regularizes the new KL objective without compromising performance. Despite its simplicity, PAPO yields significant overall improvements of 4.4%-17.5% on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more pronounced, approaching 8.0%-19.1%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also observe a substantial reduction of 30.5% in perception errors, indicating improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO.

Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study."}

Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity.

Second, prior approaches tend to introduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations, leading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current frameworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the evaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search.

This provides a larger representation of the teacher model distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens.

We varied the number of AI-generated examples (none, low, or high exposure) and if the examples were labeled as 'AI' (disclosure). Our dynamic experiment design -- ideas from prior participants in an experimental condition are used as stimuli for future participants in the same experimental condition -- speaks to the interdependent process of cultural creation: creative ideas are built upon prior ideas. Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having LLMs 'in the culture loop'. We find that high AI exposure (but not low AI exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. AI made ideas different, not better. There were no main effects of disclosure. We also found that self-reported creative people were less influenced by knowing an idea was from AI and that participants may knowingly adopt AI ideas when the task is difficult.

Alignment targets to improve win rate of a sample from the aligned model against the base model.

We show that this train/test mismatch makes standard RLHF framework sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. To this end, we propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (InfAlign), which aims to optimize inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the base model. We prove that for any inference-time decoding procedure, the optimal aligned policy is the solution to the standard RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the calibrate-and-transform RL (InfAlign-CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward.

To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination.

In zero-shot ImageNet classification, Meta CLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval."}

This log-fitting approach often leads to overfitting to narrow historical preferences, failing to capture users' evolving and latent interests. As a result, it reinforces filter bubbles and long-tail phenomena, ultimately harming user experience and threatening the sustainability of the whole recommendation ecosystem.To address these challenges, we rethink the overall design paradigm of recommender systems and propose RecGPT, a next-generation framework that places user intent at the center of the recommendation pipeline. By integrating large language models (LLMs) into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval, and explanation generation, RecGPT transforms log-fitting recommendation into an intent-centric process. To effectively align general-purpose LLMs to the above domain-specific recommendation tasks at scale, RecGPT incorporates a multi-stage training paradigm, which integrates reasoning-enhanced pre-alignment and self-training evolution, guided by a Human-LLM cooperative judge system.

Synthetic data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation, maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable and multimodal counterfactual scenarios."}

Recent research has demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and refinement.

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property. Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as in model robustness to some defenses."}

To address these issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets. Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from 3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6.

While traditional numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data, which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training. SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline methods, without additional computational cost during inference."}

In this work, we investigate whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost, minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI.

However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios."}

This challenge arises due to variations in imaging conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency. Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the reliability of the segmentation.Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches, achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse clinical domains."}

However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these issues remain limited.

Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions.

However, due to the modality divergence between vision and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights, we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps.

To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification. Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images.

State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features. However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging DomainNet.

To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation, we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.

However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of 3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1. Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10% across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.

Most 3D data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner, but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a 3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances performance in real-world 3D visual tasks.

To overcome this limitation, we explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration structure with geometric consistency.

We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets of varying complexity.

The main challenge lies in inferring unseen appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism. Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views; however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations, we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior, ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting, enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable"}

Recent studies demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial features for efficient and accurate VCOD.

Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views. To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%, 34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively."}

Methods that use this approach combine the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain.

We propose an optimization-based framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings. Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces, primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces."}

To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.

This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse 2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce significant shifts.

To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13 advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only 21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally, we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios. Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications."}

In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and can benefit robotic policy learning.

Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns. Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer files, and exploited software themes.

However, these fully automatic methods often fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological constraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces. In medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of the required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the pixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and constrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology (PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional data due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation based on the Euler Characteristic ($\\chi$). First, we propose a fast formulation for $\\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\\chi$ error between the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation metric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation network via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that highlights regions with $\\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from the arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a topology-aware correction network.

The resulting model has received no supervision, does not use any pre-trained features, and yet it can segment the domain of an image into multiple independently moving regions. The resulting motion segmentation method can handle an unknown and varying number of objects in real-time. The core multi-modal conditional encoder-decoder architecture has one modality (optical flow) feed the encoder to produce a collection of latent codes (slots), and the other modality (color image) conditions the decoder to generate the first modality (flow) from the slots. The training criterion is designed to foster 'information separation' among the slots, while the architecture explicitly allocates activations to individual slots, leading to a method we call Divided Attention (DivA). At test time, DivA handles a different number of objects and different image resolution than seen at training, and is invariant to permutations of the slots. DivA achieves state-of-the-art performance while tripling the runtime speed of comparable methods, up to 104 FPS, and reduces the performance gap from supervised methods to 12% or less. Objects bootstrapped by DivA can then be used to prime static classifiers via contrastive learning. On fewer than 5,000 video clips, training DINO on DivA's object proposals narrows the performance gap to ImageNet-based training by up to 30.2% compared to training directly on the video frames."}

Images are compressed into visual and textual prompts, which are saved instead of the original images, decreasing memory consumption by a factor of 24.

The fundamental unit of ODT is the 1D depth-resolved trace named raw A-scans (or A-line). A 2D ODT image (B-scan) is formed by reconstructing a cross-sectional flow image via Doppler phase-subtraction of raw A-scans along B-line. To obtain a high-fidelity B-scan, densely sampled A-scans are required currently, leading to prolonged scanning time and increased storage demands. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel sparse ODT reconstruction framework with an Alternative State Space Attention Network (ASSAN) that effectively reduces raw A-scans needed. Inspired by the distinct distributions of information along A-line and B-line, ASSAN applies 1D State Space Model (SSM) to each A-line to learn the intra-A-scan representation, while using 1D gated self-attention along B-line to capture the inter-A-scan features.

Current visual explanation techniques, such as gradient-based or class-activation-based methods, often exhibit a strong dependence on specific model architectures. Conversely, perturbation-based methods, despite being model-agnostic, are computationally expensive as they require evaluating models on a large number of forward passes. In this work, we introduce Foveation-based Explanations (FovEx), a novel XAI method inspired by human vision. FovEx seamlessly integrates biologically inspired perturbations by iteratively creating foveated renderings of the image and combines them with gradient-based visual explorations to determine locations of interest efficiently. These locations are selected to maximize the performance of the model to be explained with respect to the downstream task and then combined to generate an attribution map. We provide a thorough evaluation with qualitative and quantitative assessments on established benchmarks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both transformers (on 4 out of 5 metrics) and convolutional models (on 3 out of 5 metrics), demonstrating its versatility among various architectures. Furthermore, we show the alignment between the explanation map produced by FovEx and human gaze patterns (+14\\% in NSS compared to RISE, +203\\% in NSS compared to GradCAM).

This is due to strong (self-)occlusions, depth ambiguities, the vast intra- and inter-class shape variance, and the lack of 3D ground truth for natural images. Existing deep-network methods are trained on synthetic datasets to predict 3D shapes, so they often struggle generalizing to real-world images. Moreover, they lack an explicit feedback loop for refining noisy estimates, and primarily focus on geometry without directly considering pixel alignment. To tackle these limitations, we develop a novel render-and-compare optimization framework, called SDFit. This has three key innovations: First, it uses a learned category-specific and morphable signed-distance-function (mSDF) model, and fits this to an image by iteratively refining both 3D pose and shape. The mSDF robustifies inference by constraining the search on the manifold of valid shapes, while allowing for arbitrary shape topologies. Second, SDFit retrieves an initial 3D shape that likely matches the image, by exploiting foundational models for efficient look-up into 3D shape databases. Third, SDFit initializes pose by establishing rich 2D-3D correspondences between the image and the mSDF through foundational features. We evaluate SDFit on three image datasets, i.e., Pix3D, Pascal3D+, and COMIC. SDFit performs on par with SotA feed-forward networks for unoccluded images and common poses, but is uniquely robust to occlusions and uncommon poses. Moreover, it requires no retraining for unseen images. Thus, SDFit contributes new insights for generalizing in the wild. Code is available atthis https URL."}

In this study, we systematically dissect 11 open-source tools that implement distance-based metric computation by performing both a conceptual analysis of their computational steps and an empirical analysis on representative two- and three-dimensional image datasets. Alarmingly, we observed deviations in HD exceeding 100 mm and identified multiple statistically significant differences between tools - demonstrating that statistically significant improvements on the same set of segmentations can be achieved simply by selecting a particular implementation. These findings cast doubts on the validity of prior comparisons of results across studies without accounting for the differences in metric implementations.

To effectively tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach to optimize a set of compact learnable hierarchical task tokens, including global and fine-grained ones, to discover consistent pixel-wise supervision signals in both feature and prediction levels.

Using conventional, high-resolution aerial images, our approach allows sensing deep into self-occluding vegetation volumes, such as forests. It is similar in spirit to the imaging process of wide-field microscopy, but can handle much larger scales and strong occlusion. We scan focal stacks by synthetic-aperture imaging with drones and reduce out-of-focus signal contributions using pre-trained 3D convolutional neural networks with mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function. The resulting volumetric reflectance stacks contain low-frequency representations of the vegetation volume. Combining multiple reflectance stacks from various spectral channels provides insights into plant health, growth, and environmental conditions throughout the entire vegetation volume.

Despite growing interest in surgical video segmentation, annotation protocols vary widely across datasets -- some provide dense, frame-by-frame labels, while others rely on sparse annotations sampled at low frame rates such as 1 FPS. In this study, we investigate how such inconsistencies in annotation density and frame rate sampling influence the evaluation of zero-shot segmentation models, using SAM2 as a case study for cholecystectomy procedures. Surprisingly, we find that under conventional sparse evaluation settings, lower frame rates can appear to outperform higher ones due to a smoothing effect that conceals temporal inconsistencies. However, when assessed under real-time streaming conditions, higher frame rates yield superior segmentation stability, particularly for dynamic objects like surgical graspers. To understand how these differences align with human perception, we conducted a survey among surgeons, nurses, and machine learning engineers and found that participants consistently preferred high-FPS segmentation overlays, reinforcing the importance of evaluating every frame in real-time applications rather than relying on sparse sampling strategies. Our findings highlight the risk of evaluation bias that is introduced by inconsistent dataset protocols and bring attention to the need for temporally fair benchmarking in surgical video AI."}

To address these challenges, we introduce Mocap-2-to-3, a novel framework that performs multi-view lifting from monocular input by leveraging 2D data pre-training, enabling the reconstruction of metrically accurate 3D motions with absolute positions. To leverage abundant 2D data, we decompose complex 3D motion into multi-view syntheses.

However, they often lack precise pixel-level spatial control, especially in scenarios involving partially corrupted objects where critical uncorrupted cues remain. To overcome this limitation, sketch-guided methods have been introduced, using either indirect gradient modulation or direct sketch injection to improve structural control. Yet, existing approaches typically establish a one-way mapping from the sketch to the masked regions only, neglecting the contextual information from unmasked object areas. This leads to a disconnection between the sketch and the uncorrupted content, thereby causing sketch-guided inconsistency and structural mismatch. To tackle this challenge, we propose a sketch-guided bidirectional feature interaction framework built upon a pretrained Stable Diffusion model. Our bidirectional interaction features two complementary directions, context-to-sketch and sketch-to-inpainting, that enable fine-grained spatial control for partially corrupted object inpainting. In the context-to-sketch direction, multi-scale latents from uncorrupted object regions are propagated to the sketch branch to generate a visual mask that adapts the sketch features to the visible context and denoising progress. In the sketch-to-inpainting direction, a sketch-conditional affine transformation modulates the influence of sketch guidance based on the learned visual mask, ensuring consistency with uncorrupted object content. This interaction is applied at multiple scales within the encoder of the diffusion U-Net, enabling the model to restore object structures with enhanced spatial fidelity. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories.

As data-driven learning is intractable to comprehensively encapsulate diverse ranges of layouts and open spaces, we propose teaching machines to identify relational commonalities in 3D spaces. Instead of focusing on point-wise or object-wise representations, we introduce 3D scene analogies, which are smooth maps between 3D scene regions that align spatial relationships. Unlike well-studied single instance-level maps, these scene-level maps smoothly link large scene regions, potentially enabling unique applications in trajectory transfer in AR/VR, long demonstration transfer for imitation learning, and context-aware object rearrangement. To find 3D scene analogies, we propose neural contextual scene maps, which extract descriptor fields summarizing semantic and geometric contexts, and holistically align them in a coarse-to-fine manner for map estimation. This approach reduces reliance on individual feature points, making it robust to input noise or shape variations.

While discriminative Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) excels in high-level semantics, it struggles with perceiving fine-grained visual details. Generally, to enhance representations, generative models take CLIP's visual features as conditions for reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically found that visually perfect generations are not always optimal for representation enhancement. The essence lies in effectively extracting fine-grained knowledge from generative models while mitigating irrelevant information. To explore critical factors, we delve into three aspects: (1) Conditioning mechanisms: We found that even a small number of local tokens can drastically reduce the difficulty of reconstruction, leading to collapsed training. We thus conclude that utilizing only global visual tokens as conditions is the most effective strategy. (2) Denoising configurations: We observed that end-to-end training introduces extraneous information. To address this, we propose a two-stage training strategy to prioritize learning useful visual knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate that lightweight denoisers can yield remarkable improvements. (3) Generation paradigms: We explore both continuous and discrete denoisers with desirable outcomes, validating the versatility of our method. Through our in-depth explorations, we have finally arrived at an effective method, namely GenHancer, which consistently outperforms prior arts on the MMVP-VLM benchmark, e.g., 6.0% on OpenAICLIP.

However, existing models struggle with high-resolution images due to the discrepancy in image resolutions of training (with smaller resolutions) and inference (for high resolutions). Processing them at full resolution leads to decreased estimation accuracy on depth with tremendous memory consumption, while downsampling to the training resolution results in blurred edges in the estimated depth images. Prevailing high-resolution depth estimation methods adopt a patch-based approach, which introduces depth discontinuity issues when reassembling the estimated depth patches, resulting in test-time inefficiency. Additionally, to obtain fine-grained depth details, these methods rely on synthetic datasets due to the real-world sparse ground truth depth, leading to poor generalizability. To tackle these limitations, we propose Patch Refine Once (PRO), an efficient and generalizable tile-based framework. Our PRO consists of two key components: (i) Grouped Patch Consistency Training that enhances test-time efficiency while mitigating the depth discontinuity problem by jointly processing four overlapping patches and enforcing a consistency loss on their overlapping regions within a single backpropagation step, and (ii) Bias Free Masking that prevents the DE models from overfitting to dataset-specific biases, enabling better generalization to real-world datasets even after training on synthetic data.

However, when processing complex geometric structures in point clouds, MLPs' fixed activation functions struggle to efficiently capture local geometric features, while suffering from poor parameter efficiency and high model redundancy. In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate their efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a Geometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the model's robustness to geometric variations. Next, in the Local Feature Processing (LFP), a parallel structure extracts both group-level features and global context, providing a rich representation of both fine details and overall structure. Finally, these features are combined and processed in the Global Feature Processing (GFP). By repeating these operations, the receptive field gradually expands, enabling the model to capture complete geometric information of the point cloud. To overcome the high parameter counts and computational inefficiency of standard KANs, we develop Efficient-KANs in the PointKAN-elite variant, which significantly reduces parameters while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PointKAN outperforms PointMLP on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart, with particularly strong performance in Few-shot Learning task. Additionally, PointKAN achieves substantial reductions in parameter counts and computational complexity (FLOPs).

Our analysis aims to uncover disparities in model accuracy across different countries and question formats, providing insights into how training data distribution and evaluation methodologies might influence cultural biases in VLMs. The findings highlight significant variations in performance, suggesting that while VLMs possess considerable visual understanding, they inherit biases from their pre-training data and scale that impact their ability to generalize uniformly across diverse global contexts."}

To address these issues, we introduce ZIP, a scalable crowd counting framework that models blockwise counts with a Zero-Inflated Poisson likelihood: a zero-inflation term learns the probability a block is structurally empty (handling excess zeros), while the Poisson component captures expected counts when people are present (respecting discreteness). We provide a generalization analysis showing a tighter risk bound for ZIP than MSE-based losses and DMCount provided that the training resolution is moderately large.

Existing training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes, and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations, thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be released on Github."}

First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g., time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in generating shade images.

Next, we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving 49.5\\% mAP and 59.2\\% NDS on the test set.

Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics."}

Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates.

Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR.

To overcome these challenges, we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.

To address this deficiency, in this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods, frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area. The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies.

Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests, Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems.

We propose an optimization-based framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings. Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces, primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings.

Weight and activation quantization (WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ. Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques introduce substantial runtime overhead.To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x, 7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the A100 GPU and Atom, respectively."}

Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e. continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric, time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual behaviors impact overall process efficiency."}

It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism. Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial resolution."}

These false negatives can silently corrupt gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE 754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications."}

Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However, this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency, and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets and model architectures.

In this work, we investigate the function of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent 'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with process-based rewards and improves training efficiency.

Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the sole true label of a certified sample.

We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k prediction labels.

Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100 parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations, resulting in a total of 1156 parameters.

We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA), an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in actor-critic frameworks.

Multivariate curve resolution (MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable gating network to retain only active components while estimating their concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including chemical library-driven scenarios.

However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts."}

AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors, aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster. Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels. This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS. The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators, and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned.

We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines, including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of 0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection."}

Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference.

We focus on the general setting in which both the upper- and lower-level objectives are smooth but potentially nonconvex. Due to the absence of additional structural assumptions for the lower-level objective-such as convexity or the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition-guaranteeing global optimality is generally intractable. Instead, we introduce a suitable notion of stationarity for this class of problems and aim to design a first-order algorithm that finds such stationary points in polynomial time. Intuitively, stationarity in this setting means the upper-level objective cannot be substantially improved locally without causing a larger deterioration in the lower-level objective. To this end, we show that a simple and implementable variant of the dynamic barrier gradient descent (DBGD) framework can effectively solve the considered nonconvex simple bilevel problems up to stationarity. Specifically, to reach an $(\\epsilon_f, \\epsilon_g)$-stationary point-where $\\epsilon_f$ and $\\epsilon_g$ denote the target stationarity accuracies for the upper- and lower-level objectives, respectively-the considered method achieves a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\max\\left(\\epsilon_f^{-\\frac{3+p}{1+p}}, \\epsilon_g^{-\\frac{3+p}{2}}\\right)\\right)$, where $p \\geq 0$ is an arbitrary constant balancing the terms.

This paper investigates the recommender's self-awareness by quantifying its uncertainty, which provides a label-free estimation of its performance. Such self-assessment can enable more informed understanding and decision-making before the recommender engages with any users. To this end, we propose an intuitive and effective method, probability-based List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu). LiDu measures uncertainty by determining the probability that a recommender will generate a certain ranking list based on the prediction distributions of individual items. We validate LiDu's ability to represent model self-awareness in two settings: (1) with a matrix factorization model on a synthetic dataset, and (2) with popular recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets. Experimental results show that LiDu is more correlated with recommendation performance than a series of label-free performance estimators.

We propose a solution using neural likelihood estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to choose the most appropriate method for specific needs.

However, current vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation, we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.

However, existing methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations where the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be well-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the empirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target parameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the Bayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer conditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single joint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as the target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty quantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over indicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how a particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a transformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our approach to moderately sized datasets.

In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of the GAN discriminator on Langevin-based sampling, and show that the IPM-GAN optimization can be seen as one of smoothed score-matching, wherein the scores of the data and the generator distributions are convolved with the kernel function associated with the IPM.

In this study, we propose a framework named Interventional Dynamical Causality (IntDC) in contrast to the traditional Constructive Dynamical Causality (ConDC). ConDC, including Granger causality, transfer entropy and convergence of cross-mapping, measures the causality by constructing a dynamical model without considering interventions. A computational criterion, Interventional Embedding Entropy (IEE), is proposed to measure causal strengths in an interventional manner.

However, achieving such predictions typically requires iterative computations over a dense spatiotemporal grid to account for the unstable nature of chaotic systems, which is expensive and impractical in many real-world situations. An alternative approach to such a full-resolved simulation is using a coarse grid and then correcting its errors through a \\textit{closure model}, which approximates the overall information from fine scales not captured in the coarse-grid simulation. Recently, ML approaches have been used for closure modeling, but they typically require a large number of training samples from expensive fully-resolved simulations (FRS). In this work, we prove an even more fundamental limitation, i.e., the standard approach to learning closure models suffers from a large approximation error for generic problems, no matter how large the model is, and it stems from the non-uniqueness of the mapping. We propose an alternative end-to-end learning approach using a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) that overcomes this limitation by not using a closure model or a coarse-grid solver. We first train the PINO model on data from a coarse-grid solver and then fine-tune it with (a small amount of) FRS and physics-based losses on a fine grid. The discretization-free nature of neural operators means that they do not suffer from the restriction of a coarse grid that closure models face, and they can provably approximate the long-term statistics of chaotic systems. In our experiments, our PINO model achieves a 330x speedup compared to FRS with a relative error $\\sim 10\\%$. In contrast, the closure model coupled with a coarse-grid solver is $60$x slower than PINO while having a much higher error $\\sim186\\%$ when the closure model is trained on the same FRS dataset."}

Accumulator-aware quantization research has so far only considered the quantization-aware training (QAT) paradigm, in which models are fine-tuned or trained from scratch with quantization in the loop. As models and datasets continue to grow in size, QAT techniques become increasingly more expensive, which has motivated the recent surge in post-training quantization (PTQ) research.

We present theoretical motivation for AXE and demonstrate its flexibility by implementing it on top of two existing algorithms: GPFQ and OPTQ. We design AXE to support multi-stage accumulation, opening the door to full datapath optimization for the first time.

The algorithm is based on a combination of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Although GPR is a competent model for learning stochastic patterns within data and for interpolation, its performance for out-of-sample data is not very promising. By choosing a suitable data-dependent covariance function, we can enhance the performance of GPR for the German hourly power prices being tested. However, since the out-of-sample prediction is dependent on the training data, the prediction is vulnerable to noise and outliers. To overcome this issue, a separate prediction is calculated using SVR, which applies margin-based optimization. This method is advantageous when dealing with non-linear processes and outliers, since only certain necessary points (support vectors) in the training data are responsible for regression. The individual predictions are then linearly combined using uniform weights. When tested on historic German power prices, this approach outperforms the publicly available benchmarks, namely the LASSO estimated autoregressive regression model, deep neural network provided in the recent research by [1]."}

In this work, we introduce a framework, MaxInfoRL, for balancing intrinsic and extrinsic exploration. MaxInfoRL steers exploration towards informative transitions, by maximizing intrinsic rewards such as the information gain about the underlying task. When combined with Boltzmann exploration, this approach naturally trades off maximization of the value function with that of the entropy over states, rewards, and actions. We show that our approach achieves sublinear regret in the simplified setting of multi-armed bandits.

However, the approximation gap between the low-rank assumption and desired fine-tuning weights prevents the simultaneous acquisition of ultra-parameter-efficiency and better performance. To reduce this gap and further improve the power of LoRA, we propose a new PEFT method that combines two classes of adaptations, namely, transform and residual adaptations.

This learnable transform is expected to align the pre-trained weight as closely as possible to the desired weight, thereby reducing the rank of the residual weight. Then, the residual part can be effectively approximated by more compact and parameter-efficient structures, with a smaller approximation error. To achieve ultra-parameter-efficiency in practice, we design highly flexible and effective tensor decompositions for both the transform and residual adaptations. Additionally, popular PEFT methods such as DoRA can be summarized under this transform plus residual adaptation scheme.

However, direct downloading of these models for fine-tuning on the ground is impeded by privacy concerns and limited bandwidth. Satellite federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling model fine-tuning directly on-board satellites and aggregating model updates without data downloading. Nevertheless, for large foundation models, the computational capacity of satellites is insufficient to support effective on-board fine-tuning in traditional satellite FL frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose a satellite-ground collaborative federated fine-tuning framework. The key of the framework lies in how to reasonably decompose and allocate model components to alleviate insufficient on-board computation capabilities. During fine-tuning, satellites exchange intermediate results with ground stations or other satellites for forward propagation and back propagation, which brings communication challenges due to the special communication topology of space transmission networks, such as intermittent satellite-ground communication, short duration of satellite-ground communication windows, and unstable inter-orbit inter-satellite links (ISLs). To reduce transmission delays, we further introduce tailored communication strategies that integrate both communication and computing resources. Specifically, we propose a parallel intra-orbit communication strategy, a topology-aware satellite-ground communication strategy, and a latency-minimalization inter-orbit communication strategy to reduce space communication costs. Simulation results demonstrate significant reductions in training time with improvements of approximately 33%."}

We evaluate publicly available models for recognizing categorical and dimensional affect from speech on a dataset of atypical speech, comparing results to datasets of typical speech. We investigate three dimensions of speech atypicality: intelligibility, which is related to pronounciation; monopitch, which is related to prosody, and harshness, which is related to voice quality. We look at (1) distributional trends of categorical affect predictions within the dataset, (2) distributional comparisons of categorical affect predictions to similar datasets of typical speech, and (3) correlation strengths between text and speech predictions for spontaneous speech for valence and arousal. We find that the output of affect models is significantly impacted by the presence and degree of speech atypicalities. For instance, the percentage of speech predicted as sad is significantly higher for all types and grades of atypical speech when compared to similar typical speech datasets. In a preliminary investigation on improving robustness for atypical speech, we find that fine-tuning models on pseudo-labeled atypical speech data improves performance on atypical speech without impacting performance on typical speech.

Accordingly, we propose Intersectional Divergence (ID) as the first fairness measure for regression tasks that 1) describes fair model behavior across multiple protected attributes and 2) differentiates the impact of predictions in target ranges most relevant to users. We extend our proposal demonstrating how ID can be adapted into a loss function, IDLoss, that satisfies convergence guarantees and has piecewise smooth properties that enable practical optimization. Through an extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate how ID allows unique insights into model behavior and fairness, and how incorporating IDLoss into optimization can considerably improve single-attribute and intersectional model fairness while maintaining a competitive balance in predictive performance."}

We resolve these limitations through symmetric simplicial sets derived directly from hypergraphs, called symmetric simplicial lifting, which encode all possible oriented subrelations within each hyperedge as ordered tuples. This construction canonically defines adjacency via facet maps while inherently preserving hyperedge provenance. We establish that the normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacian on our symmetric simplicial lifting reduces exactly to the traditional graph normalized sheaf Laplacian when restricted to graphs, validating its mathematical consistency with prior graph-based sheaf theory. Furthermore, the induced structure preserves all structural information from the original hypergraph, ensuring that every multi-way relational detail is faithfully retained. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Hypergraph Neural Sheaf Diffusion (HNSD), the first principled extension of neural sheaf diffusion to hypergraphs. HNSD operates via normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacian over symmetric simplicial lifting, resolving orientation ambiguity and adjacency sparsity inherent to hypergraph learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate HNSDs competitive performance across established benchmarks."}

We develop a unified theoretical framework for explaining these three elements of reinforcement learning agents through the influence of individual features that the agent observes in its environment. We derive feature influences by using Shapley values, which collectively and uniquely satisfy a set of well-motivated axioms for fair and consistent credit assignment. The proposed approach, Shapley Values for Explaining Reinforcement Learning (SVERL), provides a single theoretical framework to comprehensively and meaningfully explain reinforcement learning agents. It yields explanations with precise semantics that are not only interpretable but also mathematically justified, enabling us to identify and correct conceptual issues in prior explanations.

However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination.

Current methods typically address stability by freezing the PTM backbone, which severely limits the model's plasticity, particularly when incoming data distribution diverges largely from the pre-training data. Alternatively, sequentially fine-tuning the entire PTM can adapt to new knowledge but often leads to catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the critical stability-plasticity trade-off in PTM-based CL.

Here, we explain how grokking is realised in the Jacobian of a deep network and demonstrate that aligning a network's Jacobians with the training data (in the sense of cosine similarity) ensures grokking under a low-rank Jacobian assumption. Our results provide a strong theoretical motivation for the use of Jacobian regularisation in optimizing deep networks -- a method we introduce as GrokAlign -- which we show empirically to induce grokking much sooner than more conventional regularizers like weight decay.

While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines."}

First, by incorporating CS techniques into the SHRED architecture, our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\\ell_1$ regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.We validate CS-SHRED on challenging problems including viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the traditional SHRED approach, CS-SHRED achieves significantly higher reconstruction fidelity -- as demonstrated by improved SSIM and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased robustness against noise and outliers.Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the spatiotemporal data recovery establishes CS-SHRED as a promising tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and scientific data analyses."}

This hybrid heterogeneity introduces two significant challenges: 1) heterogeneous matrix aggregation, where clients adopt different large-scale foundation models based on their task requirements and resource limitations, leading to dimensional mismatches during LoRA parameter aggregation; and 2) multi-task knowledge interference, where local shared parameters, trained with both task-shared and task-specific knowledge, cannot ensure only task-shared knowledge is transferred between clients. To address these challenges, we propose H2Tune, a federated foundation model fine-tuning with hybrid heterogeneity. Our framework H2Tune consists of three key components: (i) sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden dimensions across clients through constructing rank-consistent middle matrices, with adaptive sparsification based on client resources; (ii) relation-guided matrix layer alignment to handle heterogeneous layer structures and representation capabilities; and (iii) alternating task-knowledge disentanglement mechanism to decouple shared and specific knowledge of local model parameters through alternating optimization.

The core multi-modal conditional encoder-decoder architecture has one modality (optical flow) feed the encoder to produce a collection of latent codes (slots), and the other modality (color image) conditions the decoder to generate the first modality (flow) from the slots. The training criterion is designed to foster 'information separation' among the slots, while the architecture explicitly allocates activations to individual slots, leading to a method we call Divided Attention (DivA). At test time, DivA handles a different number of objects and different image resolution than seen at training, and is invariant to permutations of the slots. DivA achieves state-of-the-art performance while tripling the runtime speed of comparable methods, up to 104 FPS, and reduces the performance gap from supervised methods to 12% or less.

Modern fabrication techniques have greatly expanded the feasible hardware, but using these systems requires control software to translate the desired motions into actuator commands. Conventional robots can easily be modeled as rigid links connected by joints, but it remains an open challenge to model and control biologically inspired robots that are often soft or made of several materials, lack sensing capabilities, and may change their material properties with use. Here, we introduce a method that uses deep neural networks to map a video stream of a robot to its visuomotor Jacobian field (the sensitivity of all 3D points to the robot's actuators). Our method enables the control of robots from only a single camera, makes no assumptions about the robots' materials, actuation, or sensing, and is trained without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators that vary in actuation, materials, fabrication, and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. Because it enables robot control using a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate that our work will broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation."}

In this work, we introduce Foveation-based Explanations (FovEx), a novel XAI method inspired by human vision. FovEx seamlessly integrates biologically inspired perturbations by iteratively creating foveated renderings of the image and combines them with gradient-based visual explorations to determine locations of interest efficiently.

First, an autoencoder compresses each $28\\times28$ image (784 pixels) into a 64-dimensional latent vector, preserving salient features of the digit with minimal reconstruction error. We further reduce the latent representation to 5 principal components using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to match the 5 available qubits. These 5 features are encoded as rotation angles in a quantum circuit with 5 qubits. The quantum feature map applies single-qubit rotations ($R_y$ gates) proportional to the feature values, followed by a Hadamard gate and a cascade of entangling CNOT gates to produce a non-product entangled state. Measuring the 5-qubit state yields a 32-dimensional probability distribution over basis outcomes, which serves as a quantum-enhanced feature vector for classification. A classical neural network with a softmax output is then trained on these 32-dimensional quantum feature vectors to predict the digit class. We evaluate the hybrid model on the MNIST dataset and compare it to a purely classical baseline that uses the 64-dimensional autoencoder latent features for classification. The results show that the hybrid model can successfully classify digits, demonstrating the feasibility of integrating quantum computing in the classification pipeline, although its accuracy (about 75\\% on test data) currently falls below the classical baseline (about 98\\% on the same compressed data)."}

Our proof is information-theoretic and pinpoints the origin of this advantage: entanglement can be used to reduce the communication required by non-local tasks. In particular, we design a task that can be solved with certainty by quantum models with a constant number of parameters using entanglement, whereas commonly-used classical models must scale linearly to achieve a larger-than-exponentially-small accuracy.

Existing defense mechanisms suffer from notable drawbacks--including high training costs, significant inference delays, and complex hyperparameter tuning--which limit their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient inference-time defense framework: Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE). CEE enhances the model's inherent safety mechanisms by directly manipulating its internal representations, requiring neither additional training nor external modules, thereby improving defense efficiency. Furthermore, CEE introduces a rotation-based control mechanism that enables stable and linearly tunable behavioral control of the model. This design eliminates the need for tedious manual tuning and avoids the output degradation issues commonly observed in other representation engineering methods. Extensive experiments across multiple EI safety benchmarks and diverse attack scenarios demonstrate that CEE significantly improves the defense success rates of various multimodal LLMs. It effectively mitigates safety risks while preserving high-quality generation and inference efficiency, offering a promising solution for deploying safer embodied intelligence systems."}

Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social), and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and (iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model, TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning methods.

Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as \"go straight\" or \"turn right.\" However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions.

Recent advancements in vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias.

These findings reveal the presence of geometric singularities around polysemous tokens, which can lead to representational instability.

In this paper, we formalize this problem in the language of scheme theory and propose a rigorous resolution by applying the scheme-theoretic blow-up at each singular point. This procedure replaces a singular point in the ambient affine scheme with its exceptional divisor, which we identify as a canonical geometric space -- a projective space of directions -- that houses the disambiguated semantic meanings of the token. This process of ``representational desingularization'' constructs a new geometric landscape for embeddings. We prove a formal theorem guaranteeing the geometric regularization of this new space, showing that the original pathologies are resolved.

The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15 participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by 50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use commercial code LLMs."}

To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch generation.

While past studies have examined CR delays and iteration counts, few have investigated the effort based on the volume of code changes required, especially in the context of GitLab Merge Requests (MRs), which remains underexplored. In this paper, we define and measure CR effort as the amount of code modified after submission, using a dataset of over 23,600 MRs from four GitLab projects. We find that up to 71% of MRs require adjustments after submission, and 28% of these involve changes to more than 200 lines of code. Surprisingly, this effort is not correlated with review time or the number of participants. To better understand and predict CR effort, we train an interpretable machine learning model using metrics across multiple dimensions: text features, code complexity, developer experience, review history, and branching. Our model achieves strong performance (AUC 0.84-0.88) and reveals that complexity, experience, and text features are key predictors.

Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the sole true label of a certified sample.

We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k prediction labels.

While consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property, i.e., a graph is consistent or inconsistent with respect to a set of constraints, recent work has presented an approach to consistency as a graduated property. This allows living with inconsistencies for a while and repairing them when necessary. For repairing inconsistencies in a graph, we use graph transformation rules with so-called {\\em impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions} to understand how much repair gain certain rule applications would bring. Both types of conditions can be derived from given graph constraints. Our main theorem shows that the difference between the number of actual constraint violations before and after a graph transformation step can be characterized by the difference between the numbers of violated impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions. This theory forms the basis for algorithms with look-ahead that rank graph transformations according to their potential for graph repair.

The problem of detecting functional differences between two programs can be reduced to searching for a difference exposing test (DET): a test input that results in different outputs on the subject programs. In this paper, we propose Mokav, a novel execution-driven tool that leverages LLMs to generate DETs. Mokav takes two versions of a program (P and Q) and an example test input. When successful, Mokav generates a valid DET, a test input that leads to provably different outputs on P and Q. Mokav iteratively prompts an LLM with a specialized prompt to generate new test inputs. At each iteration, Mokav provides execution-based feedback from previously generated tests until the LLM produces a DET. We evaluate Mokav on 1535 pairs of Python programs collected from the Codeforces competition platform and 32 pairs of programs from the QuixBugs dataset. Our experiments show that Mokav outperforms the state-of-the-art, Pynguin and Differential Prompting, by a large margin.

For model-based testing, this means that large systems can be tested by modelling and testing their components: passing tests for all components implies passing tests for the whole system. In previous work, we defined mutual acceptance for specification models and proved that this property is a sufficient condition for compositionality in model-based testing. In this paper, we present three main algorithms for using mutual acceptance in practice. First, we can verify mutual acceptance on specifications, proving compositionality for all valid implementations. Second, we give a sound and exhaustive model-based testing procedure which checks mutual acceptance on a specific black-box implementation. The result is that testing the correctness of large systems can be decomposed into testing the component implementations for uioco conformance to their specifications, and testing for environmental conformance to the specifications of their environment. Finally, we optimise this procedure further by utilizing the constraints imposed by multiple specifications at the same time. These three algorithms together allow picking the most suitable approach for a given situation, trading in more generalizable results for faster runtime by optimising for a specific context as desired."}

However, traditional instruction often poses logistical and cognitive challenges that can hinder accessibility and student engagement. While virtual laboratories have gained traction in engineering education, few are purposefully designed to support flexible, adaptive learning in surveying. To address this gap, we developed Virtual Reality for Immersive and Interactive Surveying Education (VRISE), an immersive virtual reality laboratory that replicates ground-based and aerial surveying tasks through customizable, accessible, and user-friendly modules. VRISE features interactive experiences such as differential leveling with a digital level equipment and waypoint-based drone navigation, enhanced by input smoothing, adaptive interfaces, and real-time feedback to accommodate diverse learning styles. Evaluation across multiple user sessions demonstrated consistent gains in measurement accuracy, task efficiency, and interaction quality, with a clear progression in skill development across the ground-based and aerial surveying modalities. By reducing cognitive load and physical demands, even in tasks requiring fine motor control and spatial reasoning, VRISE demonstrates the potential of immersive, repeatable digital environments to enhance surveying education, broaden participation, and strengthen core competencies in a safe and engaging setting."}
