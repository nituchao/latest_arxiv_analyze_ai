This work presents the first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains 96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4% improvement in cost-of-pass.

This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However, there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals, discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan, and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent literals.

The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse, realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across all metrics.

The existing AI development landscape falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery, they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training, OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\\% in text-based biology and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\\% net or 161.64\\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific decision-making processes."}

However, the existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches."}

PentestJudge is a large language model (LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft. LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models, suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be confidently used in sensitive production environments."}

Using the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15 open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain specific dimensions.

Unlearnable Examples (UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox: users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \\textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image (noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of \"zero-contact data protection\", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure."}

For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i) intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii) inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines, lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\\% (vs. 74.1\\%) and raising Elliptic++ illicit-class F1 to 88.1\\% (vs. 60.4\\%).

We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input."}

Through a pipeline of large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming `quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874.

In this framework, nodes represent individual beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction), and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and representational limits.

These models are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines. However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third, we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by 85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average.

However, their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving, prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured."}

Through systematic analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization.

By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1) Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models, revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation models.

As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines, enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves adaptability in dynamic scenarios.

To address these limitations, we propose Kronos, a unified, scalable pre-training framework tailored to financial K-line modeling. Kronos introduces a specialized tokenizer that discretizes continuous market information into token sequences, preserving both price dynamics and trade activity patterns. We pre-train Kronos using an autoregressive objective on a massive, multi-market corpus of over 12 billion K-line records from 45 global exchanges, enabling it to learn nuanced temporal and cross-asset representations. Kronos excels in a zero-shot setting across a diverse set of financial tasks. On benchmark datasets, Kronos boosts price series forecasting RankIC by 93% over the leading TSFM and 87% over the best non-pre-trained baseline. It also achieves a 9% lower MAE in volatility forecasting and a 22% improvement in generative fidelity for synthetic K-line sequences. These results establish Kronos as a robust, versatile foundation model for end-to-end financial time series analysis. Our pre-trained model is publicly available atthis https URL."}

Gender- and Majority-Bias in LLM-Driven Reference Selection", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted as research assistants, particularly for literature review and reference recommendation, yet little is known about whether they introduce demographic bias into citation workflows. This study systematically investigates gender bias in LLM-driven reference selection using controlled experiments with pseudonymous author names. We evaluate several LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, and Claude Haiku) by varying gender composition within candidate reference pools and analyzing selection patterns across fields. Our results reveal two forms of bias: a persistent preference for male-authored references and a majority-group bias that favors whichever gender is more prevalent in the candidate pool. These biases are amplified in larger candidate pools and only modestly attenuated by prompt-based mitigation strategies. Field-level analysis indicates that bias magnitude varies across scientific domains, with social sciences showing the least bias. Our findings indicate that LLMs can reinforce or exacerbate existing gender imbalances in scholarly recognition. Effective mitigation strategies are needed to avoid perpetuating existing gender disparities in scientific citation practices before integrating LLMs into high-stakes academic workflows."}

An innovative spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification (WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over state-of-the-art methods.

In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using 801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples (doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the augmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high classification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially outperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present detailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier performance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture diagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based synthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction performance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes."}

To address these issues, we design two compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV.

Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting.

This approach reimagines core quantum concepts: superposition becomes a form of structured ambiguity; collapse is reframed as an introspective contraction; and entanglement is modeled as semantic resonance across streams of qualia. Drawing on insights from nominalist philosophy and oversight theoretic limits in AI, we argue that the observer paradox in quantum mechanics reflects not an ontological lacuna, but a linguistic one: the absence of a formal vocabulary for modeling first person structure. QAL introduces such a vocabulary, providing a morphodynamic framework that embeds the observer within the system and replaces abstract projection with endogenous transformation.

Although prior research has examined how context affects user responses to generic notifications and general mHealth messages, relatively little work has explored its influence on engagement with actual mental health interventions. Furthermore, while much of the existing research has focused on detecting when users might benefit from an intervention, less attention has been paid to understanding receptivity, i.e., users' willingness and ability to engage with and act upon the intervention.In this study, we investigate user receptivity through two components: acceptance(acknowledging or engaging with a prompt) and feasibility (ability to act given situational constraints).

Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1) discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual targets."}

Existing codec methods face several challenges in semantic encoding, such as residual paralinguistic information (e.g., timbre, emotion), insufficient semantic completeness, limited reconstruction capability, and lack of support for streaming. To address these challenges, we propose SecoustiCodec, a cross-modal aligned low-bitrate streaming speech codec that disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook space. To ensure semantic completeness and reconstruction fidelity, paralinguistic encoding is introduced to bridge the information gap between semantic and acoustic encoding. A semantic-only efficient quantization method based on VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and FSQ (Finite Scalar Quantization) is proposed. This approach alleviates the long-tail distribution problem of tokens while maintaining high codebook utilization. A semantic disentanglement method based on contrastive learning is proposed, which aligns text and speech in a joint multimodal frame-level space, effectively removing paralinguistic information from semantic encoding. An acoustic-constrained multi-stage optimization strategy is proposed to ensure robust and stable convergence.

To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong, cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight, surface-specific ``expert\" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.

We further present FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality alpha mattes under complex occlusions.

In this work, we show that a strong value model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a passive predictor into an active regulator of noise.

Additional enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision, Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution for the UDA in Person ReID.

In this paper, we identify that untraceable DeepFakes can be achieved through a multiplicative attack, which can fundamentally eliminate GMs' traces, thereby evading AMs even enhanced with defensive measures. We design a universal and black-box attack method that trains an adversarial model solely using real data, applicable for various GMs and agnostic to AMs. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding attack capability and universal applicability of our method, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 97.08\\% against 6 advanced AMs on DeepFakes generated by 9 GMs. Even in the presence of defensive mechanisms, our method maintains an ASR exceeding 72.39\\%.

However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology, resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap, we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of HiTeC."}

Most of these NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED using both supervised and unsupervised training.

To incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it remains consistent and logical.

Although adversarial perturbations offer a potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating privacy concerns."}

To address this issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.

Prior work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic fairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this setting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a natural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved. We begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any positive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This is surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and a natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under additional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of non-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation with high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item value (MIV).

Prior research has often probed gender bias using explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work, we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1) While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with model size.

It consists of: (1) High-Precision Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates.

On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model (MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance. Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking (PRR) metric.

We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51 styles $\\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement through systematic style-content pairing.

To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running 1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video segmentation models."}

Nagabhushan", "title": "Learning Latent Representations for Image Translation using Frequency Distributed CycleGAN", "abstract": "This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics, including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and qualitative output."}

This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy."}

Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks."}

SonicMaster is conditioned on natural language instructions to apply targeted enhancements, or can operate in an automatic mode for general restoration. To train this model, we construct the SonicMaster dataset, a large dataset of paired degraded and high-quality tracks by simulating common degradation types with nineteen degradation functions belonging to five enhancements groups: equalization, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereo.

However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity. Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the baseline methods."}

Our approach compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., \"for young people'') to those from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.

These patterns reflect and reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models.

We distill from an LLM teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases.

In this paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments, we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled design of robust learning systems."}

Homan", "title": "Forest vs Tree: The $(N, K)$ Trade-off in Reproducible ML Evaluation", "abstract": "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans, among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$ configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N \\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and $N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget."}

This proto-framework is intended as a step towards a fully operationalised framework to be used in policymaking contexts. By drawing on Kantian philosophy and related contemporary interpretations, freedom is developed as the counterpart to the concept of responsibility. Two dimensions of freedom are developed in further detail: freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity. These two dimensions of freedom are then applied in a proto-framework that systematically considers AI's impact on society using the Sustainable Development Goals. This proto-framework aims to complement current risk-based approaches and thereby offers a first step towards operationalising the concept of freedom in AI regulation."}

Based on 31 interviews with academics across disciplines, we developed a five-part codebook and identified five relationship types: Instrumental Reliance, Contingent Delegation, Co-agency Collaboration, Authority Displacement, and Epistemic Abstention. These reflect variations in trust, assessment modes, tasks, and human epistemic status. Our findings show that epistemic roles are dynamic and context-dependent.

We hypothesize that a pre-trained language model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM): an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated training datasets."}

Two fundamental limitations persist in current methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward.

By mathematically refining incremental input-to-state stability ($\\delta$ISS) theory for LSTM, we derive a practical data-independent upper bound on recovery time. This upper bound gives us resilience-aware training. Experimental validation on simple models demonstrates the effectiveness of our resilience estimation and control methods, enhancing a foundation for rigorous quality assurance in safety-critical AI applications."}

Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\\% in F1-score and 16.6\\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging, novel scenarios."}

UCCT formalizes this process as Bayesian competition between statistical priors learned in pre-training and context-driven target patterns, yielding a single quantitative account that unifies existing adaptation techniques. We ground the theory in three principles: threshold crossing, modality universality, and density-distance predictive power, and validate them with (i) cross-domain demonstrations (text QA, image captioning, multi-agent debate) and (ii) two depth-oriented experiments: a controlled numeral-base study (bases 8, 9, 10) that isolates pattern-density effects, and a layer-wise trajectory analysis that reveals phase transitions inside a 7B-parameter model. Both experiments confirm UCCT's predictions of threshold behavior, asymmetric interference, and memory hysteresis. By showing that LLM ``intelligence'' is created through semantic anchoring rather than contained within the model, UCCT offers a principled foundation for interpretable diagnostics and practical guidance for prompt engineering, model selection, and alignment-centric system design."}

While the use of LLMs is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given input-output examples.This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization, and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for triple extraction.

Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address for distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach.

While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs) aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent (GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals. We conclude that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of more human-aligned agents."}

A Data Distribution Lens", "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning."}

To address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR) framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge. The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts. Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains."}

Driven by the requirements and functionalities defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, AI/machine learning (ML)-based cellular positioning is becoming a key technology to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven cellular positioning. We begin by reviewing the fundamentals of wireless positioning and AI models, analyzing their respective challenges and synergies. We provide a comprehensive review of the evolution of 3GPP positioning standards, with a focus on the integration of AI/ML in current and upcoming standard releases. Guided by the 3GPP-defined taxonomy, we categorize and summarize state-of-the-art (SOTA) research into two major classes: AI/ML-assisted positioning and direct AI/ML-based positioning. The former includes line-of-sight (LOS)/non-line-of-sight (NLOS) detection, time of arrival (TOA)/time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation, and angle prediction; the latter encompasses fingerprinting, knowledge-assisted learning, and channel charting. Furthermore, we review representative public datasets and conduct performance evaluations of AI-based positioning algorithms using these datasets.

In this paper, we introduce AdaMCOT (Adaptive Multilingual Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual factual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes in intermediary \"thinking languages\" before generating target-language responses. AdaMCOT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings. An in-depth analysis of the model's hidden states and semantic space further elucidates the underlying mechanism of our method. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively bridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while maintaining cultural and linguistic nuances."}

Our multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) methods -- Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize -- systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn prompts.

Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%).

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity.

To address this, we propose Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW), a plug-and-play framework where in the first stage we get the ERW module serves as a warmup that initializes the early layers of the diffusion model with high-quality, pretrained representations. This warmup minimizes the burden of learning representations from scratch, thereby accelerating convergence and boosting performance.

FSBA leverages class-conditional autoencoders to generate noise triggers that align perturbed in-class samples with the original category's features, ensuring the effectiveness, intra-class consistency, inter-class specificity and natural-feature correlation of triggers. While FSBA supports swift and efficient attacks, its cross-model attack capability is relatively weak. FMBA employs a two-stage class-conditional autoencoder training process that alternates between using out-of-class samples and in-class samples. This allows FMBA to generate triggers with strong target-class features, making it highly effective for cross-model attacks. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and models, the results show that FFCBA achieves outstanding attack performance and maintains desirable robustness against the state-of-the-art backdoor defenses."}

By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, namely, adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timesteps of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a viable alternative to conditional generation.

Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability. To address this important problem of inference-time prompt optimization, we introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time optimization method that uses an agentic loop of LLMs to generate and apply textual feedback.

Edits affecting causally dependent attributes often generate unrealistic or misleading outcomes if these relationships are ignored. In this work, we introduce a causally faithful framework for counterfactual video generation, formulated as an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) prediction problem. We embed prior causal knowledge by encoding the relationships specified in a causal graph into text prompts and guide the generation process by optimizing these prompts using a vision-language model (VLM)-based textual loss. This loss encourages the latent space of the LDMs to capture OOD variations in the form of counterfactuals, effectively steering generation toward causally meaningful alternatives. The proposed framework, dubbed CSVC, is agnostic to the underlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal mechanisms or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach using standard video quality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal effectiveness and minimality. Experimental results show that CSVC generates causally faithful video counterfactuals within the LDM distribution via prompt-based causal steering, achieving state-of-the-art causal effectiveness without compromising temporal consistency or visual quality on real-world facial videos. Due to its compatibility with any black-box video editing system, our framework has significant potential to generate realistic 'what if' hypothetical video scenarios in diverse areas such as digital media and healthcare."}

However, these breakthroughs are predominantly observed for the mathematically strong Qwen2.5 series on benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, and seldom transfer to models like Llama, which warrants a more in-depth investigation. In this work, our empirical analysis reveals that pre-training on massive web-scale corpora leaves Qwen2.5 susceptible to data contamination in widely used benchmarks. Consequently, conclusions derived from contaminated benchmarks on Qwen2.5 series may be unreliable. To obtain trustworthy evaluation results, we introduce a generator that creates fully clean arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, dubbed RandomCalculation. Using this leakage-free dataset, we show that only accurate reward signals yield steady improvements that surpass the base model's performance boundary in mathematical reasoning, whereas random or incorrect rewards do not.

Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical applications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing imputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the varying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to unreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph Completion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known neighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to iteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering information to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware Feature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting propagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently, Hierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing nodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood attributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups with nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster structure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors. Finally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information across multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node representations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show that DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC methods under attribute-missing graphs."}

While SL reduces computational overhead on edge devices, it encounters significant challenges in heterogeneous environments where devices vary in computing resources, communication capabilities, environmental conditions, and privacy requirements. Although recent studies have explored heterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying resource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and local model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address these limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split Learning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device systems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a personalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to achieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models tailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and privacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers clients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without sharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources, environmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach balances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high model accuracy. We implement and evaluate P3SL on a testbed consisting of 7 devices including 4 Jetson Nano P3450 devices, 2 Raspberry Pis, and 1 laptop, using diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental conditions."}

While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality.

This design is enabled by a new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of deformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones. This allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while preserving equivariance properties.

Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships.

We demonstrate two simple, non-technical interventions to control these tendencies. Introducing these interventions into the experimental wargame design of a recent study, we substantially reduce escalation throughout the game. Calls to restrict the use of large language models in national security applications are thus premature. The U.S. government is already, and will continue, employing large language models for scenario planning and suggesting courses of action.

In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable and agent-to-agent interoperability.

However, their low inference speed limits their deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion. However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g., attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation, thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible quality drop.

For example, when interacting with a chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline (i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better than those of a standard RAG pipeline."}

Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an elementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step. From a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge may be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions (e.g., \"eat apples\"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns (\"red boat\"); and (3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions (\"laptop behind the sofa\"). Here, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences with increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective impairment.

PAD integrates confidence-based screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration to balance privacy with generation quality. A \\renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit per-response $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.

To create a dual-capability model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and 9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original long CoT reasoning capability."}

Our investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard, easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns. Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning (Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL) reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.

Our dataset spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models.

To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold. First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall, this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes.

Consequently, they often impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old knowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To address this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method for CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight perspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling operation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by consolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we dynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old knowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a weight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover, we develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current non-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the semantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has largely been ignored by previous methods.

To answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific, we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are very different."}

Prior research has often probed gender bias using explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work, we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1) While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs."}

To ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term \"Hierarchical\" reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy content safety systems.

On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model (MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR).

While prior research has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies, their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking), a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy. Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel: one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent, using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\\% in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases, resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural thinking diversity.

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM, MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively.

Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick.

Currently, top-performing embedding models are derived from pre-trained language models via extensive supervised fine-tuning using curated text pairs. This contrasts with computer vision, where self-supervised training based on data augmentations has demonstrated remarkable success. Here we systematically compare the two most well-known augmentation strategies for positive pair generation in contrastive learning of text embeddings. We assess embedding quality on MTEB and additional in-domain evaluations and show that cropping augmentation strongly outperforms the dropout-based approach. We find that on out-of-domain data, the quality of resulting embeddings is below the supervised SOTA models, but for in-domain data, self-supervised fine-tuning produces high-quality text embeddings after very short fine-tuning, sometimes only marginally below the supervised SOTA. Finally, we show that representation quality increases towards the last transformer layers, which undergo the largest change during fine-tuning; and that fine-tuning only those last layers is sufficient to reach similar embedding quality."}

To address these constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning capability of prompts like please reason step by step.

Modeling user behavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has gained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual modeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior sequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty separators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM pre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention scatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior boundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance. To address this, we propose $\\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing behavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired by attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically regulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we insert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating recommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable attention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy that explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink mechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral correlations.

This paper investigates (1) whether off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41% success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind models specifically designed for this task."}

Such noise may cause models to lose attention on key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy optimization in noisy real-world environments."}

As a result, researchers have attempted to adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information. Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue. To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to mitigate compression issues.

Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input."}

To address these challenges, we propose MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source inconsistencies.

Multi-vector approaches pioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual token embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This architecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced out-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex retrieval scenarios.

These engaging user-generated content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However, most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image measures on matching non-template-based memes.

Reproducibility in machine learning evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans, among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$ configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N \\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and $N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget."}

One stream of this type of research investigates the knowledge that PLMs have about semantic relations. However, many aspects of semantic relations were left unexplored. Generally, only one relation has been considered, namely hypernymy. Furthermore, previous work did not measure humans' performance on the same task as that performed by the PLMs. This means that at this point in time, there is only an incomplete view of the extent of these models' semantic relation knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework covering five relations beyond hypernymy, namely hyponymy, holonymy, meronymy, antonymy, and synonymy. We use five metrics (two newly introduced here) for recently untreated aspects of semantic relation knowledge, namely soundness, completeness, symmetry, prototypicality, and distinguishability. Using these, we can fairly compare humans and models on the same task. Our extensive experiments involve six PLMs, four masked and two causal language models. The results reveal a significant knowledge gap between humans and models for all semantic relations. In general, causal language models, despite their wide use, do not always perform significantly better than masked language models. Antonymy is the outlier relation where all models perform reasonably well. The evaluation materials can be found atthis https URL."}

In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function.

Through semi-structured interviews with 22 AI experts working on harmful content detection in four low-resource languages: Tamil (South Asia), Swahili (East Africa), Maghrebi Arabic (North Africa), and Quechua (South America)--we examine systemic issues in building automated moderation tools for these languages. Our findings reveal that beyond data scarcity, socio-political factors such as tech companies' monopoly on user data and lack of investment in moderation for low-profit Global South markets exacerbate historic inequities. Even if more data were available, the English-centric and data-intensive design of language models and preprocessing techniques overlooks the need to design for morphologically complex, linguistically diverse, and code-mixed languages. We argue these limitations are not just technical gaps caused by \"data scarcity\" but reflect structural inequities, rooted in colonial suppression of non-Western languages. We discuss multi-stakeholder approaches to strengthen local research capacity, democratize data access, and support language-aware solutions to improve automated moderation for low-resource languages."}

Although these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly between languages due to the imbalanced distribution of training data. Existing approaches using sample-level translation for extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages. In this paper, we introduce AdaMCOT (Adaptive Multilingual Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual factual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes in intermediary \"thinking languages\" before generating target-language responses. AdaMCOT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings. An in-depth analysis of the model's hidden states and semantic space further elucidates the underlying mechanism of our method.

We introduce CLIPPER, a compression-based approach for generating synthetic data tailored to narrative claim verification - a task that requires reasoning over a book to verify a given claim. Instead of generating claims directly from the raw text of the book, which results in artifact-riddled claims, CLIPPER first compresses the book into chapter outlines and book summaries and then uses these intermediate representations to generate complex claims and corresponding chain-of-thoughts. Compared to naive approaches, CLIPPER produces claims that are more valid, grounded, and complex. Using CLIPPER, we construct a dataset of 19K synthetic book claims paired with their source texts and chain-of-thought reasoning, and use it to fine-tune three open-weight models. Our best model achieves breakthrough results on narrative claim verification (from 28% to 76% accuracy on our test set) and sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-10B models on the NoCha leaderboard.

Our multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) methods -- Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize -- systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn prompts. Despite removing iterative back-and-forth interactions, these prompts preserve and often enhance adversarial potency: in extensive evaluations on the Multi-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset, M2S methods achieve attack success rates from 70.6 percent to 95.9 percent across several state-of-the-art LLMs. Remarkably, the single-turn prompts outperform the original multi-turn attacks by as much as 17.5 percentage points while cutting token usage by more than half on average.

However, current evaluation metrics often fail to reflect the clinical reliability of generated reports. Early overlap-based methods focus on textual matches between predicted and ground-truth entities but miss fine-grained clinical details (e.g., anatomical location, severity). Some diagnostic metrics are limited by fixed vocabularies or templates, reducing their ability to capture diverse clinical expressions. LLM-based approaches further lack interpretable reasoning steps, making it hard to assess or trust their behavior in safety-critical settings. These limitations hinder the comprehensive assessment of the reliability of generated reports and pose risks in their selection for clinical use. Therefore, we propose a Granular Explainable Multi-Agent Score (GEMA-Score) in this paper, which conducts both objective quantification and subjective evaluation through a large language model-based multi-agent workflow. Our GEMA-Score parses structured reports and employs stable calculations through interactive exchanges of information among agents to assess disease diagnosis, location, severity, and uncertainty. Additionally, an LLM-based scoring agent evaluates completeness, readability, and clinical terminology while providing explanatory feedback. Extensive experiments validate that GEMA-Score achieves the highest correlation with human expert evaluations on a public dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in clinical scoring (Kendall coefficient = $0.69$ for ReXVal dataset and Kendall coefficient = $0.45$ for RadEvalX dataset).

In addition to Representation Alignment, we also measure people's judgments of the accuracy and realism of the generated sentences. While representations like VAD break emotions into easy-to-compute components, our findings show that people agree more with how LLMs generate when conditioned on English words (e.g., ``angry'') rather than VAD scales. This difference is especially visible when comparing Numeric VAD to words. Furthermore, we found that the perception of how much a generated sentence conveys an emotion is dependent on both the representation type and which emotion it is."}

In this work, we argue theoretically and empirically that this mechanism provides a method for LLMs to avoid over-mixing, connecting this to existing lines of work that study mathematically how information propagates in Transformers. We conduct experiments to validate our theoretical intuitions and show how choices such as context length, depth, and data packing influence the sink behaviour.

In this work, we conceptualize this effect as the $\\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\\% DCG). However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training.

In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.

In addition, existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic, open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs. StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop mechanisms to ensure quality and validation.

While prior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable such behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence. We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts (``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment and truthful AI systems."}

To this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across varying input lengths.

However, existing works mostly focus on higher-order tasks, making it hard to interpret success or failure. In this work, we study how well can LLMs reason out-of-context on binary relations by only learning the representations of newly introduced tokens.

Unreliable Results of Reinforcement Learning Due to Data Contamination", "abstract": "Reasoning in large language models has long been a central research focus, and recent studies employing reinforcement learning (RL) have introduced diverse methods that yield substantial performance gains with minimal or even no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance performance. However, these breakthroughs are predominantly observed for the mathematically strong Qwen2.5 series on benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, and seldom transfer to models like Llama, which warrants a more in-depth investigation. In this work, our empirical analysis reveals that pre-training on massive web-scale corpora leaves Qwen2.5 susceptible to data contamination in widely used benchmarks. Consequently, conclusions derived from contaminated benchmarks on Qwen2.5 series may be unreliable. To obtain trustworthy evaluation results, we introduce a generator that creates fully clean arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, dubbed RandomCalculation. Using this leakage-free dataset, we show that only accurate reward signals yield steady improvements that surpass the base model's performance boundary in mathematical reasoning, whereas random or incorrect rewards do not. Moreover, we conduct more fine-grained analyses to elucidate the factors underlying the different performance observed on the MATH-500 and RandomCalculation benchmarks. Consequently, we recommend that future studies evaluate models on uncontaminated benchmarks and, when feasible, test various model series to ensure trustworthy conclusions about RL and related methods."}

Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality.

We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically biased toward abstraction.

However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction. We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied, transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning.

However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning."}

In response to this issue, we introduce Hidden in the Noise (HIN), a novel backdoor attack framework designed to exploit subtle, audio-specific features. HIN applies acoustic modifications to raw audio waveforms, such as alterations to temporal dynamics and strategic injection of spectrally tailored noise. These changes introduce consistent patterns that an ALLM's acoustic feature encoder captures, embedding robust triggers within the audio stream. To evaluate ALLM robustness against audio-feature-based triggers, we develop the AudioSafe benchmark, assessing nine distinct risk types. Extensive experiments on AudioSafe and three established safety datasets reveal critical vulnerabilities in existing ALLMs: (I) audio features like environment noise and speech rate variations achieve over 90% average attack success rate. (II) ALLMs exhibit significant sensitivity differences across acoustic features, particularly showing minimal response to volume as a trigger, and (III) poisoned sample inclusion causes only marginal loss curve fluctuations, highlighting the attack's stealth."}

We propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation. These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for effective self-supervised visual representation learning."}

NeRF achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features. Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation, bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering.

The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution, achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.

Due to the impracticality of large-scale real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives (TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position, speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will be open-sourced upon publication."}

For anomaly segmentation, these models are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\\% higher AUROC and 10.37\\% higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:this https URL"}

Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as \"turn left\" or \"move forward\"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms.

The estimated image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second, the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions. However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape. We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and optimization techniques."}

In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working conditions are different."}

By design, AFOG is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks, increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second, AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to 83% with superior speed and imperceptibility.

Our approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and 3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly outperforming existing methods.

However, their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation, we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for occlusion-aware face matting.

However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification accuracy.

The understanding step analyzes the source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3. The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop. This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence, delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner.

To mitigate the overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering technique that simultaneously eliminates \"popping\" and \"transparency\" artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix sort overhead without quality degradation."}

However, when detectors learn new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector (DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.

In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus, accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR) and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism, enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally, an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\\% for region segmentation and 88.12\\% for vessel segmentation."}

Additionally, effectively encoding textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues, we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration.

This approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate visually similar but semantically distinct actions.

Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on visual or semantic quality.

While the challenges in high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance. To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e., ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos, called \"action flow\", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically, ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes.

Real-world data acquisition is constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression, undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality bare-makeup image pairs.

To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration."}

This review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods, distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level, neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation). We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis of their effectiveness.

To address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior, encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook. Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible feature-level intervention.

Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process: first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy, and resource efficiency.

Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics, including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and qualitative output."}

This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy."}

Recently, pre-trained Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a potential for better CSAL.

However, despite their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image (SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality, robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and hyperparameters.

With fine-tuning on a single auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis (CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling. Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into prompts.

Existing demoireing methods primarily rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus (retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture, so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.

However, the extremely slow inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation."}

Compared to static images, dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network (AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI) module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling, sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales, thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive performance in video-based polyp detection tasks."}

However, these models still face the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative inference, which often leads to \"hallucinations\", outputs that are not grounded in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows, yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost. Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient framework applicable to various models."}

However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity. Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the baseline methods."}

Our approach compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., \"for young people'') to those from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories. Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors; (2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ, and sDCI datasets.

For this kind of problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible. Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on the method in use.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples.

To address these challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore, inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives.

However, the association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits, applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for statistical significance.Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes independent of disease status or treatment effects."}

Traditional methods like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape. Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects. This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones, minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity: naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM, except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife density estimation."}

These engaging user-generated content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However, most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for meme matching.

While prior research has leveraged machine learning based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6 inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co. Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25 inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the Great Famine period."}

MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment (OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF) distributions.

In this work, we convert six generative models into 3D counterfactual approaches by incorporating an anatomy-guided framework based on a causal graph, in which regional brain volumes serve as direct conditioning inputs. Each model is evaluated with respect to composition, reversibility, realism, effectiveness and minimality on T1-weighted brain MRIs (T1w MRIs) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In addition, we test the generalizability of each model with respect to T1w MRIs of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA).

At its core, AMD-Mamba introduces an innovative metric learning strategy that leverages AMD severity scale score as prior knowledge. This strategy allows the model to learn richer feature representations by aligning learned features with clinical phenotypes, thereby improving the capability of conventional prognosis methods in capturing disease progression patterns. In addition, unlike existing models that use traditional CNN backbones and focus primarily on local information, such as the presence of drusen, AMD-Mamba applies Vision Mamba and simultaneously fuses local and long-range global information, such as vascular changes. Furthermore, we enhance prediction performance through multi-scale fusion, combining image information with clinical variables at different resolutions. We evaluate AMD-Mamba on the AREDS dataset, which includes 45,818 color fundus photographs, 52 genetic variants, and 3 socio-demographic variables from 2,741 subjects.

Unlearnable Examples (UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox: users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \\textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image (noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of \"zero-contact data protection\", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure."}

With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has been performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information extraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the development of image translation models for scientific use."}

Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration; differences between the original and restored images highlight potential abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important context to guide the disease detection process.

To bridge this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement learning.

The standard paradigm uses hand-crafted dictionaries of potential data queries curated by a domain expert or a large language model after a human prompt. However, in practice, hand-crafted dictionaries are limited by the expertise of the curator and the heuristics of prompt engineering. This paper introduces a novel approach: learning a dictionary of interpretable queries directly from the dataset. Our query dictionary learning problem is formulated as an optimization problem by augmenting IP's variational formulation with learnable dictionary parameters. To formulate learnable and interpretable queries, we leverage the latent space of large vision and language models like CLIP. To solve the optimization problem, we propose a new query dictionary learning algorithm inspired by classical sparse dictionary learning. Our experiments demonstrate that learned dictionaries significantly outperform hand-crafted dictionaries generated with large language models."}

In this paper, we introduce a novel task called Medical Report Grounding (MRG), which aims to directly identify diagnostic phrases and their corresponding grounding boxes from medical reports in an end-to-end manner.

A vision encoder-decoder processes the embedded token and input image to generate grounding boxes. Critically, uMedGround incorporates an uncertainty-aware prediction model, significantly improving the robustness and reliability of grounding predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that uMedGround outperforms state-of-the-art medical phrase grounding methods and fine-tuned large visual-language models, validating its effectiveness and reliability. This study represents a pioneering exploration of the MRG task, marking the first-ever endeavor in this domain.

Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS) based on random projections, all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization of the signal source. However, many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements for efficient image reconstruction, where the signal statistics are expressed by the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising (known as a \"diffusion model\"). We demonstrate that the optimal measurements derived for two natural image datasets differ from those of PCA, ICA, or CS, and result in substantially lower mean squared reconstruction error. Interestingly, the marginal distributions of the measurement values are asymmetrical (skewed), substantially more so than those of previous methods. We also find that optimizing with respect to perceptual loss, as quantified by structural similarity (SSIM), leads to measurements different from those obtained when optimizing for MSE. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements."}

Specifically, an effective background adversarial attack framework is proposed to attack anything, by which the attack efficacy generalizes well between diverse objects, models, and tasks. Technically, we approach the background adversarial attack as an iterative optimization problem, analogous to the process of DNN learning. Besides, we offer a theoretical demonstration of its convergence under a set of mild but sufficient conditions.

Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face limitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns while simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework that applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity modeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two complementary components. The first is the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer), which combines transformer-based global attention mechanisms with graph neural networks through information bottleneck-guided pooling to identify sufficient biomarkers.

To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process.

Thus, the interaction between spatial and temporal dimensions makes decoupling motion and appearance more challenging for DiT models. In this paper, we propose DeT, a method that adapts DiT models to improve motion transfer ability. Our approach introduces a simple yet effective temporal kernel to smooth DiT features along the temporal dimension, facilitating the decoupling of foreground motion from background appearance. Meanwhile, the temporal kernel effectively captures temporal variations in DiT features, which are closely related to motion. Moreover, we introduce explicit supervision along dense trajectories in the latent feature space to further enhance motion consistency. Additionally, we present MTBench, a general and challenging benchmark for motion transfer. We also introduce a hybrid motion fidelity metric that considers both the global and local motion similarity. Therefore, our work provides a more comprehensive evaluation than previous works.

In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate their efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a Geometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the model's robustness to geometric variations.

This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, namely, adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timesteps of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance.

However, this pipeline relies on text as an intermediate medium, which may lead to error propagation and temporal misalignment between speech and CS video dynamics.

Edits affecting causally dependent attributes often generate unrealistic or misleading outcomes if these relationships are ignored. In this work, we introduce a causally faithful framework for counterfactual video generation, formulated as an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) prediction problem. We embed prior causal knowledge by encoding the relationships specified in a causal graph into text prompts and guide the generation process by optimizing these prompts using a vision-language model (VLM)-based textual loss. This loss encourages the latent space of the LDMs to capture OOD variations in the form of counterfactuals, effectively steering generation toward causally meaningful alternatives. The proposed framework, dubbed CSVC, is agnostic to the underlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal mechanisms or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach using standard video quality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal effectiveness and minimality. Experimental results show that CSVC generates causally faithful video counterfactuals within the LDM distribution via prompt-based causal steering, achieving state-of-the-art causal effectiveness without compromising temporal consistency or visual quality on real-world facial videos.

Existing hiding schemes are easily detected by the naked eyes or steganalyzers due to the cover type confined to the spatial domain, single-range feature extraction and attacks, and insufficient loss constraints. To address these issues, we propose a multi-range representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG for JPEG image hiding. This design stems from the fact that steganalyzers typically combine local-range and global-range information to better capture hidden traces. Specifically, MRAG integrates the local-range characteristic of the convolution and the global-range modeling of the transformer. Meanwhile, a features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to launch multi-range representations-driven feature-level adversarial attacks. It computes the adversarial loss between covers and stegos based on the surrogate steganalyzer's classified features, i.e., the features before the last fully connected layer. Under the dual constraints of features angle and norm, MRAG can delicately encode the concatenation of cover and secret into subtle adversarial perturbations from local and global ranges relevant to steganalysis. Therefore, the resulting stego can achieve visual and steganalysis imperceptibility. Moreover, coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency decomposition operations are devised to transform the input, introducing multi-grained information.

Subsequent investigations into enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework, ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), that enables MLLMs to learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle, i.e., verifying the rendered output against the source image is substantially easier than performing deep visual reasoning to generate a faithful, structured representation such as code. We demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL), thereby reducing reliance on image-text supervision. RRVF implements a closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback components, enabling the model to perform complex reasoning, including self-correction through multi-turn interactions. This process is optimized end-to-end using the GRPO algorithm. Extensive evaluations are conducted on image-to-code generation across two diverse domains: data charts and web interfaces. The RRVF-trained model not only outperforms existing similarly sized open-source MLLMs and supervised fine-tuning baselines but also exhibits superior generalization.

This procedure, named as Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets, yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability. Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image, leading to more compact pairs of distillation.

First, we shift the Taylor prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation, thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible quality drop.

Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images, exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational resource requirements.The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods. Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on segmentation."}

However, existing CBMs typically assume static datasets, which fundamentally limits their adaptability to real-world, continuously evolving multimodal data streams. To address this, we define a novel continual learning task for CBMs: simultaneously handling concept-incremental and class-incremental learning. This task requires models to continuously acquire new concepts (often representing cross-modal attributes) and classes while robustly preserving previously learned knowledge. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose CONceptual Continual Incremental Learning (CONCIL), a novel framework that fundamentally re-imagines concept and decision layer updates as linear regression problems. This reformulation eliminates the need for gradient-based optimization, thereby effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, CONCIL relies solely on recursive matrix operations, rendering it highly computationally efficient and well-suited for real-time and large-scale multimodal data applications. Experimental results compellingly demonstrate that CONCIL achieves \"absolute knowledge memory\" and significantly surpasses the performance of traditional CBM methods in both concept- and class-incremental settings, thus establishing a new paradigm for continual learning in CBMs, particularly valuable for dynamic multimodal understanding."}

This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer integration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when numerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time.

In contrast, at test time, we have no access to the skewed prior, and instead sample from the full, unbiased prior distribution. This gap between training and testing leads to a subpar performance. To bridge this gap, we propose conditional optimal transport C^2OT that adds a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix when computing the optimal transport assignment.

We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\\% in F1-score and 16.6\\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model.

Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations, limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks, proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of 3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic testing."}

Existing methods for handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise.

Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines, enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves adaptability in dynamic scenarios.

To address these issues, we design two compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger model.

To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting.

In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere. Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties."}

The typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e., bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable (DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is proposed for Shapley computation.

Existing approaches typically follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas; second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning, a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods. Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage approaches.

This framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially altering the course of the disease.

In this work, we show that a strong value model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO baselines.

However, motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms, respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion.

(2) Their reliance on random data augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive representation learning.

Constructing and evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable property valuations."}

However, the success of these state-of-the-art models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations. To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential."}

Recent machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale. To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO) terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with physiological responses, as shown in case study.

Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants, we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing aversion to algorithmic decision-making.

The gold score for a target class is supposed to be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the \"target-approach-1\" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class, text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while maintaining classification effectiveness."}

This advancement is underpinned by the concept of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network, and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions, ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot control, autonomous driving and LLM training."}

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP), providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the effectiveness of unlearning.

This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB). Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations, and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI requirements differ drastically from training scenarios.

This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters.

However, it remains unclear whether the superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information. Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue. To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to mitigate compression issues.

However, it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion, where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for traditionally privileged groups.

Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%, and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8% reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance, cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments."}

Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all evaluation scenarios.

Reproducibility in machine learning evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans, among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$ configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N \\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and $N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget."}

For example, there is a growing demand for composites and architected materials with heterogeneous microstructures. Designing such materials and predicting their behavior in practical applications requires solving homogenization problems for a wide range of material parameters and microstructures. While classical numerical solvers offer reliable and accurate solutions supported by a solid theoretical foundation, their high computational costs and slow convergence remain limiting factors. As a result, scientific machine learning is emerging as a promising alternative. However, such approaches often lack guaranteed accuracy and physical consistency. This raises the question of whether it is possible to develop hybrid approaches that combine the advantages of both data-driven methods and classical solvers. To address this, we introduce UNO-CG, a hybrid solver that accelerates conjugate gradient (CG) solvers using specially designed machine-learned preconditioners, while ensuring convergence by construction. As a preconditioner, we propose Unitary Neural Operators as a modification of Fourier Neural Operators. Our method can be interpreted as a data-driven discovery of Green's functions, which are then used to accelerate iterative solvers. We evaluate UNO-CG on various homogenization problems involving heterogeneous microstructures and millions of degrees of freedom. Our results demonstrate that UNO-CG enables a substantial reduction in the number of iterations and is competitive with handcrafted preconditioners for homogenization problems that involve expert knowledge. Moreover, UNO-CG maintains strong performance across a variety of boundary conditions, where many specialized solvers are not applicable, highlighting its versatility and robustness."}

These methods either define the loss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL), or indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge much more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as inefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the inefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly forms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs optimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual (SGR) loss. By tuning a weight parameter, it flexibly modulates the condition number between the original system and its normal equations, while reducing to the MSE loss in the limiting case. We systematically benchmark the convergence behavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL framework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and compare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical experiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL framework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster convergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework shows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently outperforms the MSE loss. These theoretical and empirical findings help bridge the performance gap between classical iterative solvers and optimization-based solvers, highlighting the central role of loss conditioning, and provide key insights for the design of more efficient PDE solvers."}

However, these TL methods are typically designed with specific, static assumptions on the amount of available labeled and unlabeled target data. This is in contrast with many real world applications, where the availability of data and corresponding labels varies over time. Since the evaluation of the TL methods is typically also performed under the same static data availability assumptions, this would lead to unrealistic expectations concerning their performance in real world settings. To support a more realistic evaluation and comparison of TL algorithms and models, we propose a data manipulation framework that (1) simulates varying data availability scenarios over time, (2) creates multiple domains through resampling of a given dataset and (3) introduces inter-domain variability by applying realistic domain transformations, e.g., creating a variety of potentially time-dependent covariate and concept shifts. These capabilities enable simulation of a large number of realistic variants of the experiments, in turn providing more information about the potential behavior of algorithms when deployed in dynamic settings. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed framework by performing a case study on a proprietary real-world suite of card payment datasets. Given the confidential nature of the case study, we also illustrate the use of the framework on the publicly available Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset. By providing a methodology for evaluating TL methods over time and in realistic data availability scenarios, our framework facilitates understanding of the behavior of models and algorithms. This leads to better decision making when deploying models for new domains in real-world environments."}

However, the large-scale deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different composite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess domains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a substantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques. Hence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and statistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM."}

Using 801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples (doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the augmented dataset to predict tumor type.

For example, when interacting with a chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline (i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better than those of a standard RAG pipeline."}

In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as natural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender systems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from online streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to different recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream tasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong, cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight, surface-specific ``expert\" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead. To meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a production-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving, logging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now deployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating online metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while improving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of a Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven, compute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of scaling laws in recommender systems."}

In contrast, insect-scale aerial robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\\%$ and 255$\\%$ improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11 seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers.

Our investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard, easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns. Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning (Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL) reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.

This assumption often does not hold in real-world speech systems, where distribution shifts are common due to varying environments, recording conditions, and speaker diversity.The method of Domain Shifts with Uncertainty (DSU) augments the input of each neural network layer based on the input feature statistics. It addresses the problem of out-of-domain generalization by assuming feature statistics follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution and substitutes the input with sampled features from this distribution. While effective for computer vision, applying DSU to speech presents challenges due to the nature of the data. Unlike static visual data, speech is a temporal signal commonly represented by a spectrogram - the change of frequency over time. This representation cannot be treated as a simple image, and the resulting sparsity can lead to skewed feature statistics when applied to the entire input.To tackle out-of-distribution issues in keyword spotting, we propose PatchDSU, which extends DSU by splitting the input into patches and independently augmenting each patch. We evaluated PatchDSU and DSU alongside other methods on the Google Speech Commands, Librispeech, and TED-LIUM. Additionally, we evaluated performance under white Gaussian and MUSAN music noise conditions. We also explored out-of-domain generalization by analyzing model performance on datasets they were not trained on. Overall, in most cases, both PatchDSU and DSU outperform other methods.

Therefore, we propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term \"Hierarchical\" reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation quality.

Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process: first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally.

Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input."}

We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51 styles $\\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement through systematic style-content pairing.

To address this limitation, we introduce clustering-enhanced local D-optimality, which partitions configuration space into clusters during training and applies D-optimality within each cluster. This approach substantially improves the detection of novel atomic environments in heterogeneous datasets. Our findings clarify the roles of model fidelity and data heterogeneity in UQ performance and provide a practical route to robust active learning and adaptive sampling strategies for MLIP development."}

Over the years, various methods have been developed to estimate protein binding energy, ranging from experimental techniques to computational approaches, with machine learning making significant contributions to this field. Although classical computing has demonstrated strong results in constructing predictive models, the variation of quantum computing for machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative. Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have gained traction as a research focus, raising the question of their potential advantages in predicting binding energies. To investigate this potential, this study explored the feasibility of QNNs for this task by proposing thirty variations of multilayer perceptron-based quantum neural networks. These variations span three distinct architectures, each incorporating ten different quantum circuits to configure their quantum layers. The performance of these quantum models was compared with that of a state-of-the-art classical multilayer perceptron-based artificial neural network, evaluating both accuracy and training time. A primary dataset was used for training, while two additional datasets containing entirely unseen samples were employed for testing. Results indicate that the quantum models achieved approximately 20% higher accuracy on one unseen dataset, although their accuracy was lower on the other datasets. Notably, quantum models exhibited training times several orders of magnitude shorter than their classical counterparts, highlighting their potential for efficient protein binding energy prediction."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement learning.

We explore the path towards an ML-specialized OS, MaLV-OS. MaLV-OS rethinks the OS architecture to make it specifically tailored to ML workloads, especially in virtualized clouds, which are now widely used to run ML applications. MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel, Micro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an MLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE with memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads system-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity and programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an open-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor. For more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to dynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model the user is running.

In this work, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve a counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the institution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect, information-theoretic, privacy for the user.

Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the amount of information leaked about the institution database to the user, compared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability of all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the user retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of their features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their feature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we propose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically, but ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and I-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the database leakage of the proposed schemes."}

Therefore, to ensure safety of neural networks in safety-critical environments, the robustness of a neural network must be formally verified against input perturbations, e.g., from noisy sensors. To improve the robustness of neural networks and thus simplify the formal verification, we present a novel set-based training procedure in which we compute the set of possible outputs given the set of possible inputs and compute for the first time a gradient set, i.e., each possible output has a different gradient. Therefore, we can directly reduce the size of the output enclosure by choosing gradients toward its center. Small output enclosures increase the robustness of a neural network and, at the same time, simplify its formal verification. The latter benefit is due to the fact that a larger size of propagated sets increases the conservatism of most verification methods.

In these settings, decision quality depends not on a single algorithmic ``optimum'', but on whether the portfolio of recommendations contains at least one option the human ultimately deems desirable. We propose generative curation, a framework that optimally generates recommendation sets when desirability depends on both observable objectives and unobserved qualitative considerations. Instead of a fixed solution, generative curation learns a distribution over solutions designed to maximize the expected desirability of the best option within a manageable portfolio. Our analysis identifies a trade-off between quantitative quality and qualitative diversity, formalized through a novel diversity metric derived from the reformulated objective. We implement the framework using a generative neural network and a sequential optimization method, and show in synthetic and real-world studies that it consistently reduces expected regret compared to existing benchmarks. Our framework provides decision-makers with a principled way to design algorithms that complement, rather than replace, human judgment. By generating portfolios of diverse yet high-quality options, decision-support tools can better accommodate unmodeled factors such as stakeholder preferences, political feasibility, or community acceptance.

To address this, we define a novel continual learning task for CBMs: simultaneously handling concept-incremental and class-incremental learning. This task requires models to continuously acquire new concepts (often representing cross-modal attributes) and classes while robustly preserving previously learned knowledge. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose CONceptual Continual Incremental Learning (CONCIL), a novel framework that fundamentally re-imagines concept and decision layer updates as linear regression problems. This reformulation eliminates the need for gradient-based optimization, thereby effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, CONCIL relies solely on recursive matrix operations, rendering it highly computationally efficient and well-suited for real-time and large-scale multimodal data applications. Experimental results compellingly demonstrate that CONCIL achieves \"absolute knowledge memory\" and significantly surpasses the performance of traditional CBM methods in both concept- and class-incremental settings, thus establishing a new paradigm for continual learning in CBMs, particularly valuable for dynamic multimodal understanding."}

Within this framework, one can distinguish several sources of CI: either intrinsic, train or test imbalance. Our analysis reveals that the optimal train imbalance is generally different from 50%, with a non trivial dependence on the intrinsic imbalance, the abundance of data and on the noise in the learning.

Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models."}

Our systematic analysis reveals a critical representation processing region -- primarily in the early layers -- where semantic and structural pattern learning takes place before generation can occur. To address this, we propose Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW), a plug-and-play framework where in the first stage we get the ERW module serves as a warmup that initializes the early layers of the diffusion model with high-quality, pretrained representations. This warmup minimizes the burden of learning representations from scratch, thereby accelerating convergence and boosting performance. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that ERW's efficacy depends on its precise integration into specific neural network layers -- termed the representation processing region -- where the model primarily processes and transforms feature representations for later generation.

Engineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines) connected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the relationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints must effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates predictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate CAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design intent, we label this problem 'design alignment'. A critical first step towards aligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain all geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch geometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation model with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain 93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a naive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without SFT.

Specifically, we address the problem of impact localization on shell-like structures, where knowledge of impact locations aids in assessing structural integrity. Impacts on thin-walled structures excite Lamb waves, which can be measured with piezoelectric sensors. Their dispersive characteristics make it difficult to detect and localize impacts by conventional methods. In the present contribution, we explore the localization of impacts using neural networks. In particular, we propose to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to estimate impact positions end-to-end, i.e., directly from sequential sensor data. We deal with comparatively long sequences of thousands of samples, since high sampling rate are needed to accurately capture elastic waves. For this reason, the proposed approach builds upon Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which are less prone to vanishing gradients as compared to conventional RNNs. Quality and quantity of data are crucial when training neural networks. Often, synthetic data is used, which inevitably introduces a reality gap. Here, by contrast, we train our networks using physical data from experiments, which requires automation to handle the large number of experiments needed.

However, despite these advances, the field currently lacks comprehensive, practical and extensible benchmarks to assess the utility of the public foundation models across diverse BCI tasks, hindering their widespread adoption.

Unreliable Results of Reinforcement Learning Due to Data Contamination", "abstract": "Reasoning in large language models has long been a central research focus, and recent studies employing reinforcement learning (RL) have introduced diverse methods that yield substantial performance gains with minimal or even no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance performance. However, these breakthroughs are predominantly observed for the mathematically strong Qwen2.5 series on benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, and seldom transfer to models like Llama, which warrants a more in-depth investigation. In this work, our empirical analysis reveals that pre-training on massive web-scale corpora leaves Qwen2.5 susceptible to data contamination in widely used benchmarks. Consequently, conclusions derived from contaminated benchmarks on Qwen2.5 series may be unreliable. To obtain trustworthy evaluation results, we introduce a generator that creates fully clean arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, dubbed RandomCalculation. Using this leakage-free dataset, we show that only accurate reward signals yield steady improvements that surpass the base model's performance boundary in mathematical reasoning, whereas random or incorrect rewards do not. Moreover, we conduct more fine-grained analyses to elucidate the factors underlying the different performance observed on the MATH-500 and RandomCalculation benchmarks. Consequently, we recommend that future studies evaluate models on uncontaminated benchmarks and, when feasible, test various model series to ensure trustworthy conclusions about RL and related methods."}

Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical applications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing imputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the varying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to unreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph Completion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known neighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to iteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering information to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware Feature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting propagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently, Hierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing nodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood attributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups with nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster structure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors. Finally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information across multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node representations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show that DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC methods under attribute-missing graphs."}

Although recent studies have explored heterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying resource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and local model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address these limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split Learning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device systems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a personalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to achieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models tailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and privacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers clients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without sharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources, environmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach balances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high model accuracy. We implement and evaluate P3SL on a testbed consisting of 7 devices including 4 Jetson Nano P3450 devices, 2 Raspberry Pis, and 1 laptop, using diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental conditions."}

While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines.

Our findings indicate that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem. In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates in standard classification tasks is related to addressing hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.

Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed representations.

Savitzky-Golay filtering is then employed for spectral smoothing, serving a dual role first to stabilize trends during band selection, and second to preserve fine-grained spectral features during preprocessing.

However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction. We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied, transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations.

To address this gap in the literature, we present a new hierarchical switching-state model that can be trained in an unsupervised fashion to simultaneously learn both system-level and individual-level dynamics. We employ a latent system-level discrete state Markov chain that provides top-down influence on latent entity-level chains which in turn govern the emission of each observed time series. Recurrent feedback from the observations to the latent chains at both entity and system levels allows recent situational context to inform how dynamics unfold at all levels in bottom-up fashion. We hypothesize that including both top-down and bottom-up influences on group dynamics will improve interpretability of the learned dynamics and reduce error when forecasting. Our hierarchical switching recurrent dynamical model can be learned via closed-form variational coordinate ascent updates to all latent chains that scale linearly in the number of entities. This is asymptotically no more costly than fitting a separate model for each entity. Analysis of both synthetic data and real basketball team movements suggests our lean parametric model can achieve competitive forecasts compared to larger neural network models that require far more computational resources.

However, many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements for efficient image reconstruction, where the signal statistics are expressed by the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising (known as a \"diffusion model\"). We demonstrate that the optimal measurements derived for two natural image datasets differ from those of PCA, ICA, or CS, and result in substantially lower mean squared reconstruction error. Interestingly, the marginal distributions of the measurement values are asymmetrical (skewed), substantially more so than those of previous methods. We also find that optimizing with respect to perceptual loss, as quantified by structural similarity (SSIM), leads to measurements different from those obtained when optimizing for MSE. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements."}

By jointly considering power and bandwidth allocation, transmission parameters, and AP network topology across layers, we optimize weighted resource efficiency with statistical QoS provisioning. To address the coupling among parameters, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is Collaborative Optimization among Heterogeneous Actors with Experience Sharing (COHA-ES). Power and sub-channel (SC) Actors representing multiple APs are jointly optimized under the unified guidance of a common critic.

Existing studies mainly focus on performing attacks by corrupting targeted objects (physical attack) or images (digital attack), which is intuitively acceptable and understandable in terms of the attack's effectiveness. In contrast, our focus lies in conducting background adversarial attacks in both digital and physical domains, without causing any disruptions to the targeted objects themselves. Specifically, an effective background adversarial attack framework is proposed to attack anything, by which the attack efficacy generalizes well between diverse objects, models, and tasks. Technically, we approach the background adversarial attack as an iterative optimization problem, analogous to the process of DNN learning. Besides, we offer a theoretical demonstration of its convergence under a set of mild but sufficient conditions. To strengthen the attack efficacy and transferability, we propose a new ensemble strategy tailored for adversarial perturbations and introduce an improved smooth constraint for the seamless connection of integrated perturbations. We conduct comprehensive and rigorous experiments in both digital and physical domains across various objects, models, and tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of attacking anything of the proposed method. The findings of this research substantiate the significant discrepancy between human and machine vision on the value of background variations, which play a far more critical role than previously recognized, necessitating a reevaluation of the robustness and reliability of DNNs.

Data obfuscation empowered by generative models is a promising approach to generate synthetic data such that useful information contained in the original data is preserved while sensitive information is obscured. This newly generated data will then be shared with service providers instead of the original sensor data. In this work, we propose PrivDiffuser, a novel data obfuscation technique based on a denoising diffusion model that achieves a superior trade-off between data utility and privacy by incorporating effective guidance techniques. Specifically, we extract latent representations that contain information about public and private attributes from sensor data to guide the diffusion model, and impose mutual information-based regularization when learning the latent representations to alleviate the entanglement of public and private attributes, thereby increasing the effectiveness of guidance. Evaluation on three real-world datasets containing different sensing modalities reveals that PrivDiffuser yields a better privacy-utility trade-off than the state-of-the-art in data obfuscation, decreasing the utility loss by up to $1.81\\%$ and the privacy loss by up to $3.42\\%$.

Leveraging the regularization properties of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process, we show that weak log-concavity of the data distribution evolves into log-concavity over time.

To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process.

In contrast, recent diffusion-based control policies have shown promise in generating physically realizable motion sequences, but the lack of kinematics prediction limits their steerability. Diffuse-CLoC addresses these challenges through a key insight: modeling the joint distribution of states and actions within a single diffusion model makes action generation steerable by conditioning it on the predicted states. This approach allows us to leverage established conditioning techniques from kinematic motion generation while producing physically realistic motions. As a result, we achieve planning capabilities without the need for a high-level planner.

Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains."}

Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\\% in F1-score and 16.6\\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging, novel scenarios."}

These workflows depend critically on the prompts used to provide the roles models play in such workflows. Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability. To address this important problem of inference-time prompt optimization, we introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time optimization method that uses an agentic loop of LLMs to generate and apply textual feedback. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to approach the performance of their larger counterparts. This highlights its potential for building more cost-effective and powerful hybrid AI systems, thereby democratizing access to high-performing AI."}

Unlike existing approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\\ell_0$-norm regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns.

Using a principled, partially axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct utility-based objectives."}

To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address for distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths.

With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning."}

This engineering experience paper details the application of design, development, and performance testing to an APR tool we built that repairs C/C++ code associated with 3 categories of alerts produced by multiple SA tools. Its repairs are simple and local. Furthermore, our findings convinced the maintainers of the CERT Coding Standards to re-assess and update the metrics used to assess when violations of guidelines are detectable or repairable. We discuss engineering design choices made to support goals of trustworthiness and acceptability to developers. Our APR tool repaired 8718 out of 9234 alerts produced by one SA tool on one codebase. It can repair 3 flaw categories. For 2 flaw categories, 2 SA tools, and 2 codebases, our tool repaired or dismissed as false positives over 80% of alerts, on average. Tests showed repairs did not appreciably degrade the performance of the code or cause new alerts to appear (with the possible exception of sqlite3.c). This paper describes unique contributions that include a new empirical analysis of SA data, our selection method for flaw categories to repair, publication of our APR tool, and a dataset of SA alerts from open-source SA tools run on open-source codebases. It discusses positive and negative results and lessons learned."}

REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with expected ordering.A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps.While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks. These nuance sensitive evaluators are now actively used by model training teams to support model release decisions."}

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating code with programming languages and could potentially aid in system model development, no benchmarks currently exist for evaluating their ability to generate system models with specific description languages. We present SysMBench, which comprises 151 human-curated scenarios spanning a wide range of popular domains and varying difficulty levels.

Despite the advancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high financial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when handling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for deploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires extensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the computational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective scheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse tasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies periodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an Adaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic Update Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed queries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and minimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler dynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted performance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific features as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and scheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to enhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based software engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The results show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving an average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time reduction of 63.28%."}

Despite these advantages, the process of constructing GUI prototypes remains resource-intensive and time-consuming, frequently demanding substantial effort and expertise. Recent research has sought to alleviate this burden through NL-based GUI retrieval approaches, which typically rely on embedding-based retrieval or tailored ranking models for specific GUI repositories. However, these methods often suffer from limited retrieval performance and struggle to generalize across arbitrary GUI datasets. In this work, we present GUI-ReRank, a novel framework that integrates rapid embedding-based constrained retrieval models with highly effective MLLM-based reranking techniques.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise by generating explanations of program structure and logic.

Second, retrieval inefficiency and attention saturation degrade performance in RAG pipelines, where long, unaligned contexts overwhelm attention. Third, repository specific training data is scarce and often outdated. Finally, proprietary LLMs hinder industrial adoption due to privacy and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose Key-Augmented Neural Triggers (KANT), a novel approach that embeds knowledge anchors into both training and inference. Unlike prior methods, KANT enables internal access to repository specific knowledge, reducing fragmentation and grounding inference in localized context. Moreover, we synthesize specialized data directly from code. At inference, knowledge anchors replace verbose context, reducing token overhead and latency while supporting efficient, on premise deployment. We evaluate KANT via: a qualitative human evaluation of the synthesized dataset's intent coverage and quality across five dimensions; compare against SOTA baselines across five qualitative dimensions and inference speed; and replication across different LLMs to assess generalizability. Results show that the synthetic training data aligned with information-seeking needs. KANT achieved over 60% preference from human annotators and a LocalStack expert (preferring 79% of cases). Also, KANT reduced inference latency by up to 85% across all models. Overall, it is well-suited for scalable, low-latency, on-premise deployments, providing a strong foundation for code comprehension."}

We evaluate the effectiveness of LaTCoder using multiple backbone MLLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-VL2, Gemini, and GPT-4o) on both a public benchmark and a newly introduced, more challenging benchmark (CC-HARD) that features complex layouts. The experimental results on automatic metrics demonstrate significant improvements.

This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy and efficiency."}

In fact, we investigate the design and evaluation of an AI-powered educational tool designed to enhance Arabic language learning for non-native speakers with beginner-to-intermediate proficiency level. The tool leverages advanced AI models to generate interactive visual quizzes, deploying Visual Question Answering as the primary activity. Adopting a constructivist learning approach, the system encourages active learning through real-life visual quizzes, and image-based questions that focus on improving vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension. The system integrates Vision-Language Pretraining models to generate contextually relevant image description from which Large Language Model generate assignments based on customized Arabic language Learning quizzes thanks to prompting.The effectiveness of the tool is evaluated through a manual annotated benchmark consisting of 1266 real-life visual quizzes, with human participants providing feedback. The results show a suitable accuracy rates, validating the tool's potential to bridge the gap in Arabic language education and highlighting the tool's promise as a reliable, AI-powered resource for Arabic learners, offering personalized and interactive learning experiences."}

While these problems can be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE), which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to 39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based on open models."}

However, existing methods struggle to leverage the semantic complementarity across different types of flows for representing program behaviors, and their context-unaware nature further hinders the accuracy of cross-flow semantic integration. We propose and implement MalFlows, a novel technique that achieves context-aware fusion of heterogeneous flow semantics for Android malware detection. Our goal is to leverage complementary strengths of the three types of flow-related information for precise app profiling. We adopt a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to model the rich semantics across these program flows. We further propose flow2vec, a context-aware HIN embedding technique that distinguishes the semantics of HIN entities as needed based on contextual constraints across different flows and learns accurate app representations through the joint use of multiple meta-paths. The representations are finally fed into a channel-attention-based deep neural network for malware classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively aggregate the strengths of diverse flow-related information for assessing maliciousness within apps. We evaluate MalFlows on a large-scale dataset comprising over 20 million flow instances extracted from more than 31,000 real-world apps. Experimental results demonstrate that MalFlows outperforms representative baselines in Android malware detection, and meanwhile, validate the effectiveness of flow2vec in accurately learning app representations from the HIN constructed over the heterogeneous flows."}

One of the most widely-used extensions endows Turing machines with multiple tapes. Although multitape Turing machines are an abstraction to simplify Turing machine design, students find them no less challenging. To aid students in understanding these machines, the FSM programming language provides support for their definition and execution. This, however, has proven insufficient for many students to understand the operational semantics of such machines and to understand why such machines accept or reject a word. To address this problem, three visualization tools have been developed. The first is a dynamic visualization tool that simulates machine execution. The second is a static visualization tool that automatically renders a graphic for a multitape Turing machine's transition diagram. The third is a static visualization tool that automatically renders computation graphs for multitape Turing machines. This article presents these tools and illustrates how they are used to help students design and implement multitape Turing machines. In addition, empirical data is presented that suggests these tools are well-received and found useful by students."}

In many cases, this means that it is challenging for them to comprehend the operational semantics of such machines and, as a consequence, determine why a word is accepted or rejected. This is not entirely surprising, because students are mostly trained to design and implement deterministic programs. Comprehension of pushdown automata is further complicated, because reasoning about the stack is necessary. A common difficulty students face, for example, is understanding that two different computations on the same word may reach the same state with different stack values. To aid student understanding, we present two novel dynamic visualization tools for FSM -- a domain-specific programming language for the Automata Theory classroom -- to support the design of such machines. These tools visualize all computations that may be performed, respectively, by a nondeterministic finite-state machine or by a pushdown automata in a stepwise manner. In addition, these tools aid the machine verification process by allowing users to visually validate whether the properties a state represents hold when a machine transitions into it."}

Their application to quantum software development remains limited, in part because of the lack of high-quality datasets both for LLM training and as dependable knowledge sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce PennyLang, an off-the-shelf, high-quality dataset of 3,347 PennyLane-specific quantum code samples with contextual descriptions, curated from textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the creation and open-source release of PennyLang, a purpose-built dataset for quantum programming with PennyLane; (2) a framework for automated quantum code dataset construction that systematizes curation, annotation, and formatting to maximize downstream LLM usability; and (3) a baseline evaluation of the dataset across multiple open-source models, including ablation studies, all conducted within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Using PennyLang with RAG substantially improves performance: for example, Qwen 7B's success rate rises from 8.7% without retrieval to 41.7% with full-context augmentation, and LLaMa 4 improves from 78.8% to 84.8%, while also reducing hallucinations and enhancing quantum code correctness. Moving beyond Qiskit-focused studies, we bring LLM-based tools and reproducible methods to PennyLane for advancing AI-assisted quantum development."}

This study evaluates models with relatively small parameter counts - Llama-3.2-3B, Gemma-2-9B, DeepSeek-R1-14B, and Phi-4-14B - for their ability to detect and refactor test smells using agent-based workflows. We assess workflows with one, two, and four agents over 150 instances of 5 common smells from real-world Java projects. Our approach generalizes to Python, Golang, and JavaScript. All models detected nearly all instances, with Phi-4-14B achieving the best refactoring accuracy (pass@5 of 75.3%). Phi-4-14B with four-agents performed within 5% of proprietary LLMs (single-agent). Multi-agent setups outperformed single-agent ones in three of five smell types, though for Assertion Roulette, one agent sufficed. We submitted pull requests with Phi-4-14B-generated code to open-source projects and six were merged."}

However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing."}
