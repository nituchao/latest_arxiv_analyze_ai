Currently, existing GUI agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.

We focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is, each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder). We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.

Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a \"unimodal bias\" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic constraints, often resulting in \"decision deadlocks.\" To overcome this limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC), a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions (NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline, significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers."}

To address this, we introduce a conceptual framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives. Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems."}

Our analysis reveals that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments\", ``length-scaling'' and entropy dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this, we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy."}

To address this, recent studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference. Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series (UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation quality than the specific segmentation method.

While automated red-teaming approaches promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming, that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either \"red-teaming expert\" personas or \"regular AI user\" personas. We then develop a dynamic persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new metrics to explicitly measure the \"mutation distance\" to complement existing diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method.

Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior. Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect on actual behavior.

We introduce Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive exploration toward uncharted regions.

Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent) tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR interpretation."}

Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first, heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for solving planning problems involving control parameters."}

To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential."}

Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion, ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral, task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation, present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and multi?agent extensions."}

By analyzing this process from both a noise perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents."}

We designed an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior, but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds) is roughly the same.

These possibilities raise a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans, a successor \"digital species\", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain, joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans.

We study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\\delta$-approximate 0-1 law'' for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible worlds than the uniform distribution does."}

EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios.

Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings.

We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute.

Although recent advances in financial sentiment analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models, failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education, and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to multi-modal discourse representation.

We present a cheap, scalable method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach targets \\emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates, citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks, indicating generalization beyond entities.

In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$ substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen, challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for enhancing LLM generalization."}

Choi,Kai Shu", "title": "Improving Factuality in LLMs via Inference-Time Knowledge Graph Construction", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time. However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable manner."}

By taking this geometric perspective literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity comparable to that of Adam."}

While the original treeX algorithm was developed for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso, RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn).

We introduce a curated dataset that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\\%, substantially outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.

To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches -- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness.

To develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender** agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active, goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e., configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders' weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics.

We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them with human dyads.

This variable is calculated for each user through comparisons between their posting history and their responses to posts of a wide range of viewpoints.Incorporating this factor produces a confirmation-bias-integrated gravity well model that more accurately identifies echo chambers and reveals community-level markers of information health. We validated the approach on nineteen Reddit communities, demonstrating improved detection of echo chambers.Our contribution is a framework for systematically capturing the role of confirmation bias in online group dynamics, enabling more effective identification of echo chambers.

We present a game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities."}

Prior systems often flatten garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates. These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in folding and hanging tasks.

While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the \"column-cell communication\" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA).

While supervised fine-tuning, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities. Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.

To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types, spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks: MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust and fair model evaluation."}

These clues may vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task, models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations, where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research efforts.

In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34 state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly.

To investigate this problem, we introduce two novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews: MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems."}

This is not adequately addressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges with diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To fill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale, highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10 vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio clips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive experiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods trained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio samples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice, underscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods trained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and significantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error rate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild dataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.

To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally.

While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto 3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image. Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First, we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints. Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree environments.

Simulated AI bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group, people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13% if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work, design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias in collaborative decision-making tasks.

Aiming to alleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform combinatorial problem descriptions into executable constraint models. However, the existing evaluation datasets for constraint modelling are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific instances, which do not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap by introducing CP-Bench, a novel benchmark that includes a diverse set of well-known combinatorial problems sourced from the CP community, structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven CP modelling. With this dataset, and given the variety of constraint modelling frameworks, we compare and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct constraint modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying syntax. Notably, the results show higher performance when modelling with a high-level Python-based framework. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the use of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods across different LLMs, which further increase accuracy, reaching up to 70% on this highly challenging benchmark."}

In our framework, ToM-equipped agents maintain distinct representations of their own and others' beliefs and goals. ToM agents then use an extended and adapted version of the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. We evaluate our approach through collision avoidance and foraging simulations. Results suggest that ToM agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM counterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts.

In such cases, the model's response can strongly influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat, escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe and helpful results.

On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels.

To produce these scores, each model judges the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges may disagree on the correct label.

This limits their generalization to diverse PDEs, preventing them from being practical surrogate models of numerical solvers. In this paper, we present Unisolver, a novel Transformer model trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs, aiming towards a universal neural PDE solver capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs.

Prior generative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of dexterous hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in partial point clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We propose FFHFlow, a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse, robust multi-finger grasps while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty in the partial point clouds. Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based deep latent variable model to learn a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming the mode collapse and rigid prior limitations of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility and exact likelihoods of flows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial observations and identifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis. To further enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with the flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that prioritizes grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (including diffusion models) in grasp diversity and success rate, while achieving run-time efficient sampling. We also showcase its practical value in cluttered and confined environments, where diversity-driven sampling excels by mitigating collisions (Project Page:this https URL)."}

We address this challenge by introducing oriented affordance frames, a structured representation for state and action spaces that improves spatial and intra-category generalisation and enables policies to be learned efficiently from only 10 demonstrations. More importantly, we show how this abstraction allows for compositional generalisation of independently trained sub-policies to solve long-horizon, multi-object tasks. To seamlessly transition between sub-policies, we introduce the notion of self-progress prediction, which we directly derive from the duration of the training demonstrations.

Recent studies identified early cognitive traits in LLM agents (reflection, revision, and self-correction) suggesting foundational elements of human-like experiential learning. Thus the key question: Can we design LLM agents capable of structured, cognitively grounded learning similar to human processes? In response, we propose a computational framework of Kolb's learning cycle with Vygotsky's ZPD for autonomous agents. Our architecture separates extrinsic (environment interaction) and intrinsic (internal reflection/abstraction) functions, enabling cognitively grounded scaffolded learning, where the agent initially learns within structured environments, followed by open-ended generalisation. This approach empowers agents to master complex tasks ; domains that traditional fine-tuning or simple reflective methods could not tackle effectively. Its potential is powerfully demonstrated via direct comparison with humans in real-world Kaggle data science competitions. Learning fully automated data science code generation across 81 tasks, our system, Agent K, demonstrated the ability to perform the entire workflow autonomously, achieving an Elo-MMR score of 1694, beyond median score of the Kaggle Masters (the top 2% among 200,000 users) of our study.

Instead of directly using responses from partial images for voting, we investigate using them to supervise the LVLM's responses to the original images. We propose a black-box, training-free method called DPS (Defense through Partial-Perception Supervision). In this approach, the model is prompted using the responses generated by a model that perceives only a partial image. With DPS, the model can adjust its response based on partial image understanding when under attack, while confidently maintaining its original response for clean input. Our findings show that the weak model can supervise the strong model: when faced with an attacked input, the strong model becomes less confident and adjusts its response based on the weak model's partial understanding, effectively defending against the attack. With clean input, it confidently maintains its original response. Empirical experiments show our method outperforms the baseline, cutting the average attack success rate by 76.3% across six datasets on three popular models."}

To obtain such long foresight, models must be both efficient and effective in processing long sequence. Recent advancements have enhanced the efficiency of these models; however, the challenge of effectively leveraging longer sequences persists. This is primarily due to the tendency of these models to overfit when presented with extended inputs, necessitating the use of shorter input lengths to maintain tolerable error margins. In this work, we investigate the multiscale modeling method and propose the Logsparse Decomposable Multiscaling (LDM) framework for the efficient and effective processing of long sequences. We demonstrate that by decoupling patterns at different scales in time series, we can enhance predictability by reducing non-stationarity, improve efficiency through a compact long input representation, and simplify the architecture by providing clear task assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that LDM not only outperforms all baselines in long-term forecasting benchmarks, but also reducing both training time and memory costs."}

This survey presents a systematic analysis of Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), a new paradigm that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications. GraphRAG addresses traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations: (i) graph-structured knowledge representation that explicitly captures entity relationships and domain hierarchies, (ii) efficient graph-based retrieval techniques that enable context-preserving knowledge retrieval with multihop reasoning ability, and (iii) structure-aware knowledge integration algorithms that leverage retrieved knowledge for accurate and logical coherent generation of LLMs. In this survey, we systematically analyze the technical foundations of GraphRAG and examine current implementations across various professional domains, identifying key technical challenges and promising research directions.

This extension allows EHBOS to identify contextual and dependency-driven anomalies that HBOS fails to detect. We evaluate EHBOS on 17 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across diverse anomaly detection scenarios. EHBOS outperforms HBOS on several datasets, particularly those where feature interactions are critical in defining the anomaly structure, achieving notable improvements in ROC AUC.

Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems.

Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive systems, our key insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided by historical patch knowledge. KNighter implements this vision through a multi-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against original patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively reduce false positives. Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that KNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug patterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers.

Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research."}

These statements use a glossary of terms to define a semantic feature space that can be leveraged for test input generation.

Training data matching these feature combinations can be used to fine-tune a generative model to reliably produce test inputs satisfying the precondition.

Since self-attention mechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to key objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture, scale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain adaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with dynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in transferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic segmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial transferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive Cluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images into structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized transferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA) module that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs' attention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low transferability and high semantic uncertainty.

To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies."}

The vast majority of TD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single action-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less attention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value functions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in learning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether such approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze these algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We find that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the prediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over Q-learning in the control setting. Finally, we introduce a new AV-learning algorithm called Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ), which significantly outperforms Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark."}

Computer vision presents a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. This study addresses the problem using a multifaceted approach: framing it as a fine-grained recognition task, fusing patient metadata with X-rays, and leveraging weights from a separate fine-grained dataset rather than from a coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet. Unlike prior work, this is the first application of metadata integration for wrist pathology recognition. Our results show that combining fine-grained transformer approach, fine-grained pre-training, and metadata integration improves diagnostic accuracy by 2% on small custom curated dataset and over 10% on a larger fracture dataset."}

Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds), significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding. Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 58\\%, while achieving a 6.52\\% improvement in the 3D detection task and a 6.25\\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task."}

Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness.

There is a rich history underlying how principles of local justice determine how society decides on prioritization mechanisms in such domains. In this paper, we examine how well LLM judgments align with human judgments, as well as with socially and politically determined vulnerability scoring systems currently used in the domain of homelessness resource allocation. Crucially, we use real data on those needing services (maintaining strict confidentiality by only using local large models) to perform our analyses. We find that LLM prioritizations are extremely inconsistent in several ways: internally on different runs, between different LLMs, and between LLMs and the vulnerability scoring systems. At the same time, LLMs demonstrate qualitative consistency with lay human judgments in pairwise testing. Findings call into question the readiness of current generation AI systems for naive integration in high-stakes societal decision-making."}

We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR."}

This strategy allows the model to create more diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text.

While early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts, which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other first-order MBRL methods.

A major unsolved problem, addressed in this paper, is how to devise representational-system (RS) agnostic techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a novel calculus, called structure transfer, that enables representation transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a source representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us to generate a target representation for a target RS. The generality of structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source representation and the generated target representation satisfy any specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting schemas, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can express preservation of information across relations between any pair of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We formalise this using Representational Systems Theory, building on the key concept of a construction space.

Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the best scores.

However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA), designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data."}

Although recent advances in financial sentiment analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models, failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education, and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation, while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains involving high-stakes communication."}

In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it: predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage, remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end, we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a SIB post.

Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach targets \\emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates, citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks, indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection."}

Frameworks designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB, can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time. However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable manner."}

Recent work has leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of suggesting responsible further research in this direction.

With the continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However, current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG, a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving 10.3\\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the \"column-cell communication\" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\\% of the baseline methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this framework is available atthis https URL."}

A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60 F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry.

While supervised fine-tuning, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities. Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning. Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse fine-tuning scenarios.

To address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to generate correct SQL.

These systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First, existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments, featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261 movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character. Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency."}

This paper addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language, specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing Italian-Ladin translation baselines.

However, real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34 state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios."}

To fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach). The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1 score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C). Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent studies."}

However, current research lacks both evaluation benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory, which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought.

To investigate this problem, we introduce two novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews: MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems."}

These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and (2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance, and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks."}

Our analysis reveals that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments\", ``length-scaling'' and entropy dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this, we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning.

Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior. Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and interpretability."}

Unfortunately, this design introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent, neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful evidence is also present in the retrieval pool.

The training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations.

We investigate people's preferences for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been investigated in human-AI collaboration.

Existing evaluations consider these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss; (ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii) Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and evaluate on seven recent models.

Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of their shared representations.

External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.

We analyzed two complete regional datasets from the Lombardy Region (Italy), covering all referrals between 2019 and 2021 for venous echocolordoppler of the lower limbs (ECD;n=496,971; development) and flexible endoscope colonoscopy (FEC; n=407,949; testing only).

However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models.

Blindly prioritizing \"customer experience\" in such scenarios leads to creditor vulnerabilities: revenue leakage, moral hazard, and systemic exploitation. To address this, we propose EQ-Knight, an LLM agent that dynamically optimizes emotional strategy to defend creditor interests. Unlike naive empathy-centric bots, EQ-Knight integrates emotion memory and game-theoretic reasoning, powered by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to track and predict debtor emotional states.

Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of short-videos.

A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies."}

Disentangling Trainable Components in the Transformer", "abstract": "The transformer architecture is central to the success of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), in part due to its surprising ability to perform a wide range of tasks - including mathematical reasoning, memorization, and retrieval - using only gradient-based learning on next-token prediction. While the core component of a transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard transformers to variants in which either the MLP layers or the attention weights are frozen at initialization. Surprisingly, we find that attention with frozen key and query weights is not only able to form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling. We formalize this by proving a new expressivity result for transformer models with frozen key and query weights. To further isolate the contribution of attention, we design MixiT, an architecture with entirely random attention scores, with provably stable signal propagation that overcomes prior depth-wise scaling challenges in random transformers. We use the successes and failures of MixiT to understand the role each transformer component plays, such as attention being largely responsible for in-context reasoning, and MLPs being responsible for, but collaborates with attention, on knowledge storage. Our results suggest that the transformer architecture has a built-in inductive bias towards forming specialized circuits, as it does even without learnable attention weights."}

Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g., self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat, escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process. Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels.

To produce these scores, each model judges the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual quantifies the disposition of the model itself."}

In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14 state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the development of more secure systems."}

Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency. However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets, including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation model within a multi-task learning paradigm.

Addressing these biases individually proves inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL) deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end multibias solution for visual recognition.

We evaluated the method on six public datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso, RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn).

To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches -- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness.

Addressing them requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However, existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly, lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context.

However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on fine-grained datasets."}

Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures.

To address these issues, we propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments.

This problem is valuable in a variety of applications, including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of each module.

These frames are fused into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review."}

Unlike conventional person search, this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g., falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1 accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code and models will be released for future research."}

In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities. However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC. Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks.

While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto 3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image. Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First, we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints. Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree environments.

Though few-step distillation methods, particularly Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex 3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective: distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD), to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD) further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s (2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high visual and geometric fidelity.

To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations, despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision.

We achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained segmentation masks.

While UMs can also support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss; (ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii) Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of their shared representations.

This survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for analyzing the structural disparities.

A large model thus requires powerful GPUs with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed 3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models, directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.

Applied to twelve historic quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction, color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions: tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business formats.

Most of the existing approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach, approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters, but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations. Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous scattering in a feed-forward manner."}

The goal of this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control, limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than ``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i) human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion. Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized motion generation."}

Recent advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars. However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand, generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time, controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars.

Enhancing Image Retrieval with Efficient Local Search and Effective Global Re-ranking", "abstract": "The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local, stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.

We address this challenge by introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across all evaluated step counts.

A multi-receptive-field non-local network (MRFNLN) consisting of the multi-stream feature attention block (MSFAB) and the cross non-local block (CNLB) is presented in this paper to further enhance the performance. We start with extracting richer features for dehazing. Specifically, a multi-stream feature extraction (MSFE) sub-block, which contains three parallel convolutions with different receptive fields (i.e., $1\\times 1$, $3\\times 3$, $5\\times 5$), is designed for extracting multi-scale features. Following MSFE, an attention sub-block is employed to make the model adaptively focus on important channels/regions. These two sub-blocks constitute our MSFAB. Then, we design a cross non-local block (CNLB), which can capture long-range dependencies beyond the query. Instead of the same input source of query branch, the key and value branches are enhanced by fusing more preceding features. CNLB is computation-friendly by leveraging a spatial pyramid down-sampling (SPDS) strategy to reduce the computation and memory consumption without sacrificing the performance. Last but not least, a novel detail-focused contrastive regularization (DFCR) is presented by emphasizing the low-level details and ignoring the high-level semantic information in a representation space specially designed for dehazing. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MRFNLN model outperforms recent state-of-the-art dehazing methods with less than 1.5 Million parameters."}

More specifically, during training, StraightFM creates couplings of images and noise via one diffusion model as a coupling prior to straighten trajectories for few-step generation. Our coupling strategy can also integrate with the existing coupling direction from real data to noise, improving image quality in few-step generation. Experimental results on pixel space and latent space show that StraightFM yields attractive samples within 5 steps.

In addition to this large benchmarking attempt, we also reproduce the following models from scratch using PyTorch on the MS COCO 2017 dataset: DETR, RTMDet, ViTDet and YOLOv7. More importantly, we propose a unified training and evaluation pipeline, based on MMDetection's features, to better compare models. Our implementation of DETR and ViTDet could not achieve accuracy or speed performances comparable to what is declared in the original papers. On the other hand, reproduced RTMDet and YOLOv7 could match such performances. Studied papers are also found to be generally lacking for reproducibility purposes. As for MMDetection pretrained models, speed performances are severely reduced with limited computing resources (larger, more accurate models even more so).

Extensive efforts have been made to explore unique representations of generative models and use them to attribute a synthetic image to the model that produced it. Most of the methods classify the models or the architectures among those in a closed set without considering the possibility that the system is fed with samples produced by unknown architectures. With the continuous progress of AI technology, new generative architectures continuously appear, thus driving the attention of researchers towards the development of tools capable of working in open-set scenarios. In this paper, we propose a framework for open set attribution of synthetic images, named BOSC (Backdoor-based Open Set Classification), that relies on the concept of backdoor attacks to design a classifier with rejection option. BOSC works by purposely injecting class-specific triggers inside a portion of the images in the training set to induce the network to establish a matching between class features and trigger features. The behavior of the trained model with respect to triggered samples is then exploited at test time to perform sample rejection using an ad-hoc score. Experiments show that the proposed method has good performance, always surpassing the state-of-the-art. Robustness against image processing is also very good. Although we designed our method for the task of synthetic image attribution, the proposed framework is a general one and can be used for other image forensic applications."}

The symmetrized point-to-plane distance relies on both the positions and normals of the corresponding points, resulting in a more accurate approximation of the underlying geometry and can achieve higher accuracy than existing methods. To solve this optimization problem efficiently, we introduce an as-rigid-as-possible regulation term to estimate the deformed normals and propose an alternating minimization solver using a majorization-minimization strategy.

To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point.

In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state.

Existing defense methods show that such vision attacks are sensitive to image modifications especially cropping, using majority voting across responses of modified images as corrected responses. However, these modifications often result in partial images and distort the semantics, which reduces response quality on clean images after voting. Instead of directly using responses from partial images for voting, we investigate using them to supervise the LVLM's responses to the original images. We propose a black-box, training-free method called DPS (Defense through Partial-Perception Supervision). In this approach, the model is prompted using the responses generated by a model that perceives only a partial image. With DPS, the model can adjust its response based on partial image understanding when under attack, while confidently maintaining its original response for clean input. Our findings show that the weak model can supervise the strong model: when faced with an attacked input, the strong model becomes less confident and adjusts its response based on the weak model's partial understanding, effectively defending against the attack. With clean input, it confidently maintains its original response. Empirical experiments show our method outperforms the baseline, cutting the average attack success rate by 76.3% across six datasets on three popular models."}

However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays, the fusion of information across agents often results in feature representations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors. Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose CoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the potential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception. Specifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of a powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent information serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This process denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused features. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay information of agents is with high-level noise.

While global and patch-level domain adaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with dynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in transferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic segmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial transferability analysis.

The analysis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer architecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recognition. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models."}

However, generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images. Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction, our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to obtain their results as references, finally \"looks again\" the image and rethinks about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate hallucinations. We evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, the results indicate that enhancing expert models, which are typically small and easy to iterate, enable performance improvements for VLMs."}

To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms, with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning, pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a ``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\\rightarrow$ abstract attributes $\\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\\rightarrow$ pattern consistency $\\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option, fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:"}

While existing methods have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods.

The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design.

To address this, we present BuzzSet v1.0, a large-scale dataset of high-resolution pollinator images collected under real field conditions. BuzzSet contains 7,856 manually verified images with more than 8,000 annotated instances across three classes: honeybees, bumblebees, and unidentified insects. Initial annotations were produced using a YOLOv12 model trained on external data and refined through human verification with open-source tools. All images were preprocessed into 256 x 256 tiles to improve the detection of small insects. We provide baselines using the RF-DETR transformer-based object detector. The model achieves strong classification accuracy with F1 scores of 0.94 and 0.92 for honeybees and bumblebees, with minimal confusion between these categories. The unidentified class remains more difficult due to label ambiguity and fewer samples, yet still contributes insights for robustness evaluation. Overall detection performance (mAP at 0.50 of 0.559) illustrates the challenging nature of the dataset and its potential to drive advances in small object detection under realistic ecological conditions. Future work focuses on expanding the dataset to version 2.0 with additional annotations and evaluating further detection strategies.

Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid, progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs.

We demonstrate that when equipped with an encoder-decoder structure, the empirically successful disentangled methods can be reformulated as an optimal quantization problem, where a finite set of points is found to approximate the underlying probability measure by minimizing the expected projection distance.

However, gradients of deeper neurons are notoriously misaligned, which obscures the network's internal representations. We posit that models do align gradients with data, yet this is concealed by the intrinsic noise of the ReLU hard gating. We validate this intuition by applying soft gating in the backward pass only, reducing the local impact of weakly excited neurons. The resulting modified gradients, which we call \"excitation pullbacks\", exhibit striking perceptual alignment on a number of ImageNet-pretrained architectures, while the rudimentary pixel-space gradient ascent quickly produces easily interpretable input- and target-specific features. Inspired by these findings, we formulate the \"path stability\" hypothesis, claiming that the binary activation patterns largely stabilize during training and get encoded in the pre-activation distribution of the final model. When true, excitation pullbacks become aligned with the gradients of a kernel machine that mainly determines the network's decision. This provides a theoretical justification for the apparent faithfulness of the feature attributions based on these pullbacks, potentially even leading to mechanistic interpretability of deeper models. Incidentally, we give a possible explanation for the effectiveness of Batch Normalization and Deep Features, together with a novel perspective on the network's internal memory and generalization properties. We release the code and an interactive app for easier exploration of the excitation pullbacks."}

Such bias can negatively affect model fairness, model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes (gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets."}

Empirically, we conclude that this new class of optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric perspective.

The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also show how NMF can be employed for data denoising."}

We refer to this problem as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as $\\Omega(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ rate in episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness.

To develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender** agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active, goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e., configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders' weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics.

Current time series online learning methods focus on two main aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently, updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

The scattering behavior of a surface is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories, using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior. A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity, including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio, were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks."}

We present a game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities."}

The increasing availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios. Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the ray-tracing outputs.

In this paper, we present a reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation."}

In this work, we provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification, and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm.

Visual Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase, where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage scenarios.

In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay, which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input data."}

Our analysis reveals that several existing approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise injection schemes in deep models."}

Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552 unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics, survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results: SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset, exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices: 0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76).

Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure: a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines."}

The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally.

We address this challenge by introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps.

Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent underlying human decision-making processes.

Our approach targets \\emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates, citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities.

Frameworks designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB, can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters.

In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$ substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen, challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for enhancing LLM generalization."}

We introduce an alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and resulting transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of lag time. We derive an additional expression for the transition rate, relate the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics based on the mean-squared residual, and discuss further numerical considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes."}

To address these shortcomings, we introduce Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM), a novel training objective enabling continuous normalizing flows to model Boltzmann distributions using only energy function evaluations. Our objective reformulates conditional flow matching via importance sampling, allowing training with samples from arbitrary proposal distributions.

Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior. Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and interpretability."}

FMs are largely unexplored in climate research. A pre-trained encoder-decoder from a 2.3 billion parameter FM (NASA and IBM Research's Prithvi WxC) -- which contains a latent probabilistic representation of atmospheric evolution -- is fine-tuned (or reused) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity waves (GWs).

A comparison of monthly averages and instantaneous evolution with a machine learning model baseline (an Attention U-Net) reveals superior predictive performance of the FM parameterization throughout the atmosphere, even in regions excluded from pre-training. This performance boost is quantified using the Hellinger distance, which is 0.11 for the baseline and 0.06 for the fine-tuned model.

A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60 F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry.

Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings. Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective, learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning, which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on two of the datasets."}

This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types, spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks: MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench.

Most of the existing approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach, approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters, but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations. Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous scattering in a feed-forward manner."}

In this paper, we theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm -- Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient fine-tuning process.

We present a biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning, which uses high-dimensional embeddings as reference vectors to identify behavior changes of individual users. We evaluate our model against two alternative approaches: a (non-learned) motion analysis based on central tendencies of movement patterns and subjective post-exposure embodiment questionnaires frequently used in various XR exposures. In a within-subject study, participants performed a fruit collection task while embodying avatars of different body heights (short, actual-height, and tall). Subjective assessments confirmed the effective manipulation of perceived body schema, while the (non-learned) objective analyses of head and hand movements revealed significant differences across conditions.

In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement.

Each agent independently learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized, safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints, using only data and convex optimization tools."}

We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences.

We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.

The key challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments. To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions, making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation."}

Motivated by this, a series of robust models are crafted to enhance the adversarial robustness of graph-based learning systems on homophilic graphs. However, the security of graph-based learning systems on heterophilic graphs remains a mystery to us. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we start to explore the vulnerability of graph-based learning systems regardless of the homophily degree, and theoretically prove that the update of the negative classification loss is negatively correlated with the pairwise similarities based on the powered aggregated neighbor features. The theoretical finding inspires us to craft a novel robust graph structural learning strategy that serves as a useful graph mining module in a robust model that incorporates a dual-kNN graph constructions pipeline to supervise the neighbor-similarity-preserved propagation, where the graph convolutional layer adaptively smooths or discriminates the features of node pairs according to their affluent local structures.

Our experiments demonstrate that Pareto-ISL accurately models the tails of the distributions while still effectively capturing their central characteristics.The original ISL function was conceived for 1D data sets.

We address this by exploring an underexplored area of DRL for inventory management: training generally capable agents (GCAs) under zero-shot generalization (ZSG). Here, GCAs are advanced DRL policies designed to handle a broad range of sampled problem instances with diverse inventory challenges.

Recent studies identified early cognitive traits in LLM agents (reflection, revision, and self-correction) suggesting foundational elements of human-like experiential learning.

However, naively caching and reusing past responses leads to a big quality drop. In this paper, we introduce IC-Cache, a caching system that enables live LLM capability augmentation to improve serving efficiency: by leveraging historical request-response pairs from larger models as in-context examples, IC-Cache empowers small LLMs to imitate and even exceed the compositional abilities (e.g., reasoning) of their larger counterparts, enabling selective offloading of requests to reduce cost and latency. Achieving this live augmentation at scale introduces intricate trade-offs between response quality, latency, and system throughput. For a new request, IC-Cache efficiently selects similar, high-utility examples to prepend them to the new request's input. At scale, it adaptively routes requests across LLMs of varying capabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. IC-Cache employs a cost-aware cache replay mechanism that refines example quality offline to maximize online cache utility and efficiency.

Synthetic values generated by imputation models often raise concerns about data quality and the reliability of data-driven outcomes. To address these concerns, this article proposes an imputation-free incremental attention learning (IFIAL) method for tabular data. A pair of attention masks is derived and retrofitted to a transformer to directly streamline tabular data without imputing or initializing missing values. The proposed method incrementally learns partitions of overlapping and fixed-size feature sets to enhance the efficiency and performance of the transformer. The average classification performance rank order across 17 diverse tabular data sets highlights the superiority of IFIAL over 11 state-of-the-art learning methods with or without missing value imputations. Further experiments substantiate the robustness of IFIAL against varying missing value types and rates compared to methods involving missing value imputation. Our analysis reveals that a feature partition size of half the original feature space is, both computationally and in terms of accuracy, the best choice for the proposed incremental learning. The proposed method is one of the first solutions to enable deep attention learning of tabular data without requiring missing-value imputation. The source code for this paper is publicly available."}

A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies."}

While the core component of a transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard transformers to variants in which either the MLP layers or the attention weights are frozen at initialization. Surprisingly, we find that attention with frozen key and query weights is not only able to form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling. We formalize this by proving a new expressivity result for transformer models with frozen key and query weights. To further isolate the contribution of attention, we design MixiT, an architecture with entirely random attention scores, with provably stable signal propagation that overcomes prior depth-wise scaling challenges in random transformers. We use the successes and failures of MixiT to understand the role each transformer component plays, such as attention being largely responsible for in-context reasoning, and MLPs being responsible for, but collaborates with attention, on knowledge storage.

In this work, we introduce \\textit{Stochastic Parameter Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models.

In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class imbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of imbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior obfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation, we propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate Message imbalance in Fraud Detection (MimbFD). Specifically, we design a topological message reachability module for high-quality node representation learning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient propagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust node representations, enhancing the stable association between node representations and labels to balance the influence of different classes.

Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether such approaches are theoretically sound in general.

This new tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can emerge and organise in autoencoder models, through a controlled ablation study in which only the activation function is altered. Using this technique, the validity of whether function-driven symmetries can act as implicit inductive biases on representations is determined. Representations are found to tend to discretise when the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic permutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a continuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. This confirms the hypothesis that the symmetries of network primitives can carry unintended inductive biases, which produce task-independent artefactual structures in representations. The discrete symmetry of contemporary forms is shown to be a strong predictor for the production of discrete representations emerging from otherwise continuous distributions -- a quantisation effect. This motivates further reassessment of functional forms in common usage due to such unintended consequences. Moreover, this supports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations may form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability phenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general linear features and possibly Superposition. Hence, this tool and proposed mechanism for the influence of functional form on representations may provide insights into interpretability research. Finally, preliminary results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to correlate with a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing previous conjectures that this collapse can be detrimental."}

As a result, established platforms in other domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges.

However, gradients of deeper neurons are notoriously misaligned, which obscures the network's internal representations. We posit that models do align gradients with data, yet this is concealed by the intrinsic noise of the ReLU hard gating. We validate this intuition by applying soft gating in the backward pass only, reducing the local impact of weakly excited neurons. The resulting modified gradients, which we call \"excitation pullbacks\", exhibit striking perceptual alignment on a number of ImageNet-pretrained architectures, while the rudimentary pixel-space gradient ascent quickly produces easily interpretable input- and target-specific features. Inspired by these findings, we formulate the \"path stability\" hypothesis, claiming that the binary activation patterns largely stabilize during training and get encoded in the pre-activation distribution of the final model. When true, excitation pullbacks become aligned with the gradients of a kernel machine that mainly determines the network's decision. This provides a theoretical justification for the apparent faithfulness of the feature attributions based on these pullbacks, potentially even leading to mechanistic interpretability of deeper models. Incidentally, we give a possible explanation for the effectiveness of Batch Normalization and Deep Features, together with a novel perspective on the network's internal memory and generalization properties.

We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.

We investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established image-based cognitive assessments, such as the \"Cookie Theft\" picture description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were evaluated.

Advanced prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating creative outputs.

Such bias can negatively affect model fairness, model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes (gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art.

We demonstrate this method on compressible Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational workflows in physics and engineering."}

We prove that RTGs at random initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional smoothness.

Cheng", "title": "Structure Transfer: an Inference-Based Calculus for the Transformation of Representations", "abstract": "Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this paper, is how to devise representational-system (RS) agnostic techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a novel calculus, called structure transfer, that enables representation transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a source representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us to generate a target representation for a target RS. The generality of structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source representation and the generated target representation satisfy any specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting schemas, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can express preservation of information across relations between any pair of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We formalise this using Representational Systems Theory, building on the key concept of a construction space. The abstract nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative representations in a wide range of practical settings."}

This paper introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator) and evolutionary search.

Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn, soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage, CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent, and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness, particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop type applications across globally diverse regions."}

More specifically, during training, StraightFM creates couplings of images and noise via one diffusion model as a coupling prior to straighten trajectories for few-step generation. Our coupling strategy can also integrate with the existing coupling direction from real data to noise, improving image quality in few-step generation. Experimental results on pixel space and latent space show that StraightFM yields attractive samples within 5 steps.

To simulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have been developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically. However, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is not enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute time-integrals of BM such as $\\int_s^t W_r \\, dr$. With the aim of using high order SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of BM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our construction is included in the popular Diffrax library (this https URL).Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a single PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which results in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and strong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is logarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT algorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our construction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and its time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\\varepsilon$ apart.We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new VBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve more than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an adaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem, where our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth of its function evaluations."}

Prior generative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of dexterous hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in partial point clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We propose FFHFlow, a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse, robust multi-finger grasps while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty in the partial point clouds. Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based deep latent variable model to learn a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming the mode collapse and rigid prior limitations of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility and exact likelihoods of flows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial observations and identifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis. To further enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with the flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that prioritizes grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (including diffusion models) in grasp diversity and success rate, while achieving run-time efficient sampling. We also showcase its practical value in cluttered and confined environments, where diversity-driven sampling excels by mitigating collisions (Project Page:this https URL)."}

However, existing analyses of the algorithm for strongly log-concave distributions suggest that, as the dimension $d$ of the problem increases, the number of iterations required to ensure convergence within a desired error in the $W_2$ metric scales in proportion to $d$ or $\\sqrt{d}$. In this paper, we argue that, despite this poor scaling of the $W_2$ error for the full set of variables, the behavior for a small number of variables can be significantly better: a number of iterations proportional to $K$, up to logarithmic terms in $d$, often suffices for the algorithm to converge to within a desired $W_2$ error for all $K$-marginals. We refer to this effect as delocalization of bias. We show that the delocalization effect does not hold universally and prove its validity for Gaussian distributions and strongly log-concave distributions with certain sparse interactions. Our analysis relies on a novel $W_{2,\\ell^\\infty}$ metric to measure convergence. A key technical challenge we address is the lack of a one-step contraction property in this metric. Finally, we use asymptotic arguments to explore potential generalizations of the delocalization effect beyond the Gaussian and sparse interactions setting."}

ConServe is a new LLM co-serving system that achieves high throughput and strong online latency guarantees by managing resources at finer granularities. ConServe introduces three techniques: (1) a latency-aware token-level scheduler that precisely sizes offline batches and tokens to fit within online latency objectives; (2) sub-iteration, layer-wise preemption that allows offline tasks to yield to online load spikes; and (3) incremental KV cache management that enables preempting and resuming offline requests at near-zero cost.

Specifically, we tackle three key tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an open-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether a given audio sample was generated by a specific target neural speech synthesis system (with access only to data from that system); (2) multi-model attribution in a closed-world setting, where the objective is to identify the generating system from a known pool of candidates; and last but not least (3) detection of synthetic versus real speech. Our approach leverages standardized average residuals-the difference between an input audio signal and its filtered version using either a low-pass filter or the EnCodec audio autoencoder. We demonstrate that these residuals consistently capture artifacts introduced by diverse speech synthesis systems, serving as distinctive, model-agnostic fingerprints for attribution. Across extensive experiments, our approach achieves AUROC scores exceeding 99% in most scenarios, evaluated on augmented benchmark datasets that pair real speech with synthetic audio generated by multiple synthesis systems.

This training is repeated on many new words to develop a general word-learning ability. We find that training models from scratch with Minnow on human-scale child-directed language enables strong few-shot word learning, comparable to a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on orders of magnitude more data. Furthermore, through discriminative and generative evaluations, we demonstrate that finetuning pre-trained LLMs with Minnow improves their ability to discriminate between new words, identify syntactic categories of new words, and generate reasonable new usages and definitions for new words, based on one or a few in-context examples. These findings highlight the data efficiency of Minnow and its potential to improve language model performance in word learning tasks."}

An effective binding between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and pathogen-derived peptides presented on Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHCs) mediate an immune response. However, predicting these interactions remains challenging due to limited functional data on T-cell reactivities. Here, we introduce a computational approach to predict TCR interactions with peptides presented on MHC class I alleles, and to design novel immunogenic peptides for specified TCR-MHC complexes. Our method leverages HERMES, a structure-based, physics-guided machine learning model trained on the protein universe to predict amino acid preferences based on local structural environments. Despite no direct training on TCR-pMHC data, the implicit physical reasoning in HERMES enables us to make accurate predictions of both TCR-pMHC binding affinities and T-cell activities across diverse viral epitopes and cancer neoantigens, achieving up to 0.72 correlation with experimental data. Leveraging our TCR recognition model, we develop a computational protocol for de novo design of immunogenic peptides. Through experimental validation in three TCR-MHC systems targeting viral and cancer peptides, we demonstrate that our designs -- with up to five substitutions from the native sequence -- activate T-cells at success rates of up to 50%. Lastly, we use our generative framework to quantify the diversity of the peptide recognition landscape for various TCR-MHC complexes, offering key insights into T-cell specificity in both humans and mice. Our approach provides a platform for immunogenic peptide and neoantigen design, as well as for evaluating TCR specificity, offering a computational framework to inform design of engineered T-cell therapies and vaccines."}

First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video) dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926 samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs).

When such systems include deep neural networks (DNNs), Testing becomes challenging, as DNNs approximate functions for which the formalization of functional requirements is intractable. This prevents the application of well-developed approaches to requirements-based testing to DNNs.To address this, we propose a requirements-based testing method (RBT4DNN) that uses natural language requirements statements. These statements use a glossary of terms to define a semantic feature space that can be leveraged for test input generation. RBT4DNN formalizes preconditions of functional requirements as logical combinations of those semantic features. Training data matching these feature combinations can be used to fine-tune a generative model to reliably produce test inputs satisfying the precondition. Executing these tests on a trained DNN enables comparing its output to the expected requirement postcondition behavior. We propose two use cases for RBT4DNN: (1) given requirements defining DNN correctness properties, RBT4DNN comprises a novel approach for detecting faults, and (2) during development, requirements-guided exploration of model behavior can provide developers with feedback on model generalization. Our further evaluation shows that RBT4DNN-generated tests are realistic, diverse, and aligned with requirement preconditions, enabling targeted analysis of model behavior and effective fault detection."}

Existing methods usually solve the problem with limited resolution of spatial discretization, and/or cannot deal with complex practical constraints well. We propose to enhance the practical applicability of online 3D-BPP via learning on a novel hierarchical representation, packing configuration tree (PCT). PCT is a full-fledged description of the state and action space of bin packing which can support packing policy learning based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The size of the packing action space is proportional to the number of leaf nodes, making the DRL model easy to train and well-performing even with continuous solution space. We further discover the potential of PCT as tree-based planners in deliberately solving packing problems of industrial significance, including large-scale packing and different variations of BPP setting. A recursive packing method is proposed to decompose large-scale packing into smaller sub-trees while a spatial ensemble mechanism integrates local solutions into global. For different BPP variations with additional decision variables, such as lookahead, buffering, and offline packing, we propose a unified planning framework enabling out-of-the-box problem solving. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing online BPP baselines and is versatile in incorporating various practical constraints. The planning process excels across large-scale problems and diverse problem variations. We develop a real-world packing robot for industrial warehousing, with careful designs accounting for constrained placement and transportation stability.

In this paper, we learn the empirical flexibility of gas units from their electricity generation, revealing how real-world limitations can lead to substantial differences between units with similar technical characteristics. Using a novel deep clustering approach, we transform 5 years (2019-2023) of unit-level hourly generation data for 49 German units from 100 MWp of installed capacity into low-dimensional embeddings. Our unsupervised approach identifies two clusters of peaker units (high flexibility) and two clusters of non-peaker units (low flexibility). The estimated ramp rates of non-peakers, which constitute half of the sample, display a low empirical flexibility, comparable to coal units. Non-peakers, predominantly owned by industry and municipal utilities, show limited response to low residual load and negative prices, generating on average 1.3 GWh during those hours. As the transition to renewables increases market variability, regulatory changes will be needed to unlock this flexibility potential."}

However, complex schemas can introduce noise, increase hallucinations, and raise computational costs. Schema filtering addresses these challenges by including only relevant schema elements, improving query generation while reducing token costs. This work explores various schema filtering methods for Text2Cypher task and analyzes their impact on token length, performance, and cost. Results show that schema filtering effectively optimizes Text2Cypher, especially for smaller models. Consistent with prior research, we find that larger models benefit less from schema filtering due to their longer context capabilities.

Recently, a few attempts were made to formalise Goodhart's law, either by categorising variants of it, or by looking at how optimising a proxy metric affects the optimisation of an intended goal. In this work, we alleviate the simplifying independence assumption, made in previous works, and the assumption on the learning paradigm made in most of them, to study the effect of the coupling between the proxy metric and the intended goal on Goodhart's law. Our results show that in the case of light tailed goal and light tailed discrepancy, dependence does not change the nature of Goodhart's effect. However, in the light tailed goal and heavy tailed discrepancy case, we exhibit an example where over-optimisation occurs at a rate inversely proportional to the heavy tailedness of the discrepancy between the goal and the metric. %"}

We build general tools to prove lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of replicable testers, unifying and quantitatively improving upon existing results.We identify a set of canonical properties, and prove that any replicable testing algorithm can be modified to satisfy these properties without worsening accuracy or sample complexity. A canonical replicable algorithm computes a deterministic function of its input (i.e., a test statistic) and thresholds against a uniformly random value in $[0,1]$. It is invariant to the order in which the samples are received, and, if the testing problem is ``symmetric,'' then the algorithm is also invariant to the labeling of the domain elements, resolving an open question by Liu and Ye [NeurIPS'24]. We prove new lower bounds for uniformity, identity, and closeness testing by reducing to the case where the replicable algorithm satisfies these canonical properties.We systematize and improve upon a common strategy for replicable algorithm design based on test statistics with known expectation and bounded variance.

Moreover, we show that the characterizations for different entropy notions can be simultaneously achieved by a single, universal function that simultaneously witnesses computational hardness and computational randomness. A key technical insight of our work is that the notion of weight-restricted calibration from the recent literature on algorithm fairness, along with standard computational indistinguishability (known as multiaccuracy in the fairness literature), suffices for proving pseudoentropy characterizations for general entropy notions. This demonstrates the power of weight-restricted calibration to enhance the classic Complexity-Theoretic Regularity Lemma (Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan, 2009) and Leakage Simulation Lemma (Jetchev and Pietrzak, 2014) and allows us to achieve an exponential improvement in the complexity dependency on the alphabet size compared to the pseudoentropy characterizations by Casacuberta, Dwork, and Vadhan (2024) based on the much stronger notion of multicalibration.

Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. This study addresses the problem using a multifaceted approach: framing it as a fine-grained recognition task, fusing patient metadata with X-rays, and leveraging weights from a separate fine-grained dataset rather than from a coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet. Unlike prior work, this is the first application of metadata integration for wrist pathology recognition. Our results show that combining fine-grained transformer approach, fine-grained pre-training, and metadata integration improves diagnostic accuracy by 2% on small custom curated dataset and over 10% on a larger fracture dataset."}

While early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts, which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot, across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks."}

With many open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods, and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible. Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while saving approximately 20-fold in training time."}

In such settings, traditional positioning techniques relying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe multipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel generative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional diffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted electromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling strategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at the geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information and mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack of known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to the maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant radio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the full RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization is then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM. Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based localization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical knowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach achieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost, offering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS emitter localization."}

To address the lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual quantifies the disposition of the model itself."}

In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14 state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the development of more secure systems."}

This tendency has led to a focus on audio tokenization for Large Models (LMs). Unlike semantic-only text tokens, audio tokens must both capture global semantic content and preserve fine-grained acoustic details. Moreover, they provide a discrete method for speech and music that can be effectively integrated into MLLMs. However, existing research is unsuitable in the definitions of semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. In addition, the evaluation of different codecs typically concentrates on specific domains or tasks, such as reconstruction or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task, which prevents fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address these problems, this paper provides suitable definitions for semantic and acoustic tokens and introduces a systematic evaluation framework. This framework allows for a comprehensive assessment of codecs' capabilities which evaluate across four dimensions: audio reconstruction metric, codebook index (ID) stability, decoder-only transformer perplexity, and performance on downstream probe tasks. Our results show the correctness of the provided suitable definitions and the correlation among reconstruction metrics, codebook ID stability, downstream probe tasks and perplexity."}

Our proposed ANOVA-BART enhances interpretability, preserves and extends the theoretical guarantees of BART, and achieves superior predictive performance. Specifically, we establish that the posterior concentration rate of ANOVA-BART is nearly minimax optimal, and further provides the same convergence rates for each interaction that are not available for BART. Moreover, comprehensive experiments confirm that ANOVA-BART surpasses BART in both accuracy and uncertainty quantification, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in component selection. These results suggest that ANOVA-BART offers a compelling alternative to BART by balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and theoretical consistency."}

Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in various ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings, character deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much time students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our inability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as abstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states.Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first algorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this algorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual tracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student programming behavior that can now be done at scale.Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree nodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code states. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student coursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse trees.Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that code is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops, a third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with which students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle.Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to understanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of structural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what syntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and attention shifting within the code."}

Existing studies acknowledge transparency as essential for trust, fairness, and engagement, yet its relationship with DX has not been systematically conceptualized. Hence, this work aims to advance the understanding of transparency in SECO from a developer-centered perspective. To this end, we propose SECO-TransDX (Transparency in Software Ecosystems from a Developer Experience Perspective), a conceptual model that introduces the notion of DX-driven transparency. The model identifies 63 interrelated concepts, including conditioning factors, ecosystem procedures, artifacts, and relational dynamics that influence how transparency is perceived and constructed during developer interactions. SECO-TransDX was built upon prior research and refined through a Delphi study with experts from academia and industry. It offers a structured lens to examine how transparency mediates DX across technical, social, and organizational layers.

Previously, researchers have proposed automatic approaches to facilitate identifying these vulnerability-related IRs, but these works focus on textual descriptions but lack the comprehensive analysis of IR's rich-text information. In this paper, we propose VulRTex, a reasoning-guided approach to identify vulnerability-related IRs with their rich-text information. In particular, VulRTex first utilizes the reasoning ability of the Large Language Model (LLM) to prepare the Vulnerability Reasoning Database with historical IRs. Then, it retrieves the relevant cases from the prepared reasoning database to generate reasoning guidance, which guides LLM to identify vulnerabilities by reasoning analysis on target IRs' rich-text information. To evaluate the performance of VulRTex, we conduct experiments on 973,572 IRs, and the results show that VulRTex achieves the highest performance in identifying the vulnerability-related IRs and predicting CWE-IDs when the dataset is imbalanced, outperforming the best baseline with +11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, and +10.5% Macro-F1, and 2x lower time cost than baseline reasoning approaches.

In this study, we aim to confirm previous observations and investigate whether and how the distribution of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify the interactions, comparing interactions among code smells and interactions between code smells and non-code smells. Our results suggest that while interactions between code smell pairs are associated with increases in certain dependencies and decreases in others, overall, they are associated with an increase in total dependencies. For example, the median number of dependencies between Feature Envy methods and Data Classes is seven times as many as when the methods are non-Feature Envy methods, increasing from 1 to 7. This implies that developers should prioritize addressing code smells that interact with each other, rather than code smells that exist only in isolation."}

This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to Python packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools remains underexplored.

An LLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy, achieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul as the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further carry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that vulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and exhibit a wide variety of types.

This paper presents the design and development of a Blood Donation Web Platform, a web-based system that connects patients, donors, and administrators within a centralized digital space. The platform allows interested donors to register their personal information, including blood group, contact details, and availability. Patients can search for donors based on blood group and location, and the system provides a list of nearby donors who are ready to donate. The platform design was guided by use case, database, class, and sequence diagrams to ensure a well-structured and efficient system architecture. Modern web technologies, including PHP (Laravel framework), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and MySQL, supported by XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, were employed to implement a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform. By streamlining donor refgistration, blood requests, and communication, the proposed system reduces delays and complexities in emergencies, improving timely accessibility of blood and enhancing overall efficiency in blood donation services."}

Davis,Antonio Bianchi,Aravind Machiry", "title": "Reactive Bottom-Up Testing", "abstract": "Modern computing systems remain rife with software vulnerabilities. Engineers apply many means to detect them, of which dynamic testing is one of the most common and effective. However, most dynamic testing techniques follow a top-down paradigm, and struggle to reach and exercise functions deep within the call graph. While recent works have proposed Bottom-Up approaches to address these limitations, they face challenges with false positives and generating valid inputs that adhere to the context of the entire program.In this work, we introduce a new paradigm that we call Reactive Bottom-Up Testing. Our insight is that function-level testing is necessary but not sufficient for the validation of vulnerabilities in functions. What we need is a systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also validates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that detected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a three-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions and generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and extract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by combining constraints to remove false positives. We implemented an automated prototype, which we call Griller. We evaluated Griller in a controlled setting using a benchmark of 48 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects, where we successfully detected 28 known vulnerabilities. Additionally, we evaluated Griller on several real-world applications such as Pacman, and it discovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities. Our findings suggest that Reactive Bottom-Up Testing can significantly enhance the detection of vulnerabilities in complex systems, paving the way for more robust security practices."}

Among them, image-based approaches are considered potential alternatives due to their efficiency and scalability. Recent studies have reported that these approaches suffer significant performance declines when confronted with obfuscation or concept drift. However, existing solutions often treat these two challenges as different problems, offering independent solutions. These techniques overlook the fact that both challenges share a common statistical root, out-of-distribution, and research from this perspective remains limited. In response, we propose BIDO, a hybrid image-based malware detector designed to enhance robustness against both obfuscation and concept drift simultaneously. Specifically, to improve the discriminative power of image features, we introduce a local feature selection module that identifies informative subregions within malware images. Second, to enhance feature robustness, we model pairwise cross-modal dependencies in an outer product space, enabling the extraction of stable co-occurrence patterns. Third, to ensure feature compactness, we design a learnable metric that pulls samples with identical labels closer while pushing apart those with different labels, regardless of obfuscation or concept drift. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets demonstrate that BIDO significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher robustness against both concept drift and obfuscation.

This study evaluates the performance of several leading large language models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Mistral-AI's Large2, in understanding and analyzing concurrency issues within software programs. Given that relaxed memory models, such as Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), are widely implemented and adapted in modern systems, supported even by commodity architectures like ARM and x86, our evaluation focuses not only on sequentially consistent memory models but also on these relaxed memory models. Specifically, we assess two main aspects: the models' capacity to detect concurrency problems under a sequentially consistent memory model and their ability to verify the correctness conditions of concurrent programs across both sequentially consistent and relaxed memory models. To do this, we leverage SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus tests designed to evaluate Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO) memory models. The experimental results reveal that GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Mistral-AI's Large2 demonstrate a robust understanding of concurrency issues, effectively identifying data races and deadlocks when assessed under a sequentially consistent memory model. However, despite its superior performance, all selected LLMs face significant challenges verifying program correctness under relaxed memory models. These LLMs exhibit limitations in accurately capturing memory ordering constraints, and their current capabilities fall short in verifying even small programs in these complex scenarios."}

However, designing and implementing static analyzers is challenging, time-consuming, and typically limited to predefined bug patterns. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for static analysis, directly applying them to scan large systems remains impractical due to computational constraints and contextual limitations.We present KNighter, the first approach that unlocks scalable LLM-based static analysis by automatically synthesizing static analyzers from historical bug patterns. Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive systems, our key insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided by historical patch knowledge. KNighter implements this vision through a multi-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against original patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively reduce false positives. Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that KNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug patterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers. To date, KNighter-synthesized checkers have discovered 92 new, critical, long-latent bugs (average 4.3 years) in the Linux kernel; 77 are confirmed, 57 fixed, and 30 have been assigned CVE numbers. This work establishes an entirely new paradigm for scalable, reliable, and traceable LLM-based static analysis for real-world systems via checker synthesis."}

Dwyer", "title": "RBT4DNN: Requirements-based Testing of Neural Networks", "abstract": "Testing allows developers to determine whether a system functions as expected. When such systems include deep neural networks (DNNs), Testing becomes challenging, as DNNs approximate functions for which the formalization of functional requirements is intractable. This prevents the application of well-developed approaches to requirements-based testing to DNNs.To address this, we propose a requirements-based testing method (RBT4DNN) that uses natural language requirements statements. These statements use a glossary of terms to define a semantic feature space that can be leveraged for test input generation. RBT4DNN formalizes preconditions of functional requirements as logical combinations of those semantic features. Training data matching these feature combinations can be used to fine-tune a generative model to reliably produce test inputs satisfying the precondition. Executing these tests on a trained DNN enables comparing its output to the expected requirement postcondition behavior. We propose two use cases for RBT4DNN: (1) given requirements defining DNN correctness properties, RBT4DNN comprises a novel approach for detecting faults, and (2) during development, requirements-guided exploration of model behavior can provide developers with feedback on model generalization. Our further evaluation shows that RBT4DNN-generated tests are realistic, diverse, and aligned with requirement preconditions, enabling targeted analysis of model behavior and effective fault detection."}

Recent methods emphasize using large language models (LLMs) for automated logging statement generation, but these present privacy and resource issues, hindering their suitability for enterprise use. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study evaluating small open-source language models (SOLMs) for automated logging statement generation. We evaluate four prominent SOLMs using various prompt strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our results show that fine-tuned SOLMs with LoRA and RAG prompts, particularly Qwen2.5-coder-14B, outperform existing tools and LLM baselines in predicting logging locations and generating high-quality statements, with robust generalization across diverse repositories. These findings highlight SOLMs as a privacy-preserving, efficient alternative for automated logging."}

A Comparison of Interviews, Focus Groups, and Surveys", "abstract": "As software systems grow increasingly complex, explainability has become a crucial non-functional requirement for transparency, user trust, and regulatory compliance. Eliciting explainability requirements is challenging, as different methods capture varying levels of detail and structure. This study examines the efficiency and effectiveness of three commonly used elicitation methods - focus groups, interviews, and online surveys - while also assessing the role of taxonomy usage in structuring and improving the elicitation process. We conducted a case study at a large German IT consulting company, utilizing a web-based personnel management software. A total of two focus groups, 18 interviews, and an online survey with 188 participants were analyzed. The results show that interviews were the most efficient, capturing the highest number of distinct needs per participant per time spent. Surveys collected the most explanation needs overall but had high redundancy. Delayed taxonomy introduction resulted in a greater number and diversity of needs, suggesting that a two-phase approach is beneficial. Based on our findings, we recommend a hybrid approach combining surveys and interviews to balance efficiency and coverage. Future research should explore how automation can support elicitation and how taxonomies can be better integrated into different methods."}

Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair.In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B.We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair."}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system.In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy."}

Besides, the existing benchmarks usually focus on limited code completion scenarios, which cannot reflect the repository-level code completion abilities well of existing methods. To address these limitations, we propose the R2C2-Coder to enhance and benchmark the real-world repository-level code completion abilities of code Large Language Models, where the R2C2-Coder includes a code prompt construction method R2C2-Enhance and a well-designed benchmark R2C2-Bench. Specifically, first, in R2C2-Enhance, we first construct the candidate retrieval pool and then assemble the completion prompt by retrieving from the retrieval pool for each completion cursor position. Second, based on R2C2 -Enhance, we can construct a more challenging and diverse R2C2-Bench with training, validation and test splits, where a context perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate the real-world repository-level code completion well.
