However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases."}

In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage. Multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate well-reasoned verdicts with explicit justifications.

In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools.

We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models.

Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication.

Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research", "abstract": "While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, \"aligned\" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just."}

We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale."}

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data."}

This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy."}

Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy.

To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively."}

General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions."}

A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models. Our work turns ratio-of-densities steering with heterogeneous experts from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation."}

Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines."}

To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods."}

Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing stud- ies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling.

We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns.

However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches.

However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks.

To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking.

General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001).

Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through \"concept deliberation\", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort."}

We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control.

A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $\\rho\\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\\geq 0.5$ after 10\\% outlier removal).

Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories."}

This makes verification difficult, especially because personalized models must forget the targeted samples while preserving local utility, and verification must remain lightweight on edge devices.We introduce ZK APEX, a zero-shot personalized unlearning method that operates directly on the personalized model without retraining. ZK APEX combines sparse masking on the provider side with a small Group OBS compensation step on the client side, using a blockwise empirical Fisher matrix to create a curvature-aware update designed for low overhead. Paired with Halo2 zero-knowledge proofs, it enables the provider to verify that the correct unlearning transformation was applied without revealing any private data or personalized parameters.On Vision Transformer classification tasks, ZK APEX recovers nearly all personalization accuracy while effectively removing the targeted information.

A random forest classifier trained on a carefully curated benchmark dataset of known metamorphic and single-fold proteins achieves a mean AUC of 0.869 with cross-validation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our integrated approach. Furthermore, by applying our classifier to 600 randomly sampled proteins from the Protein Data Bank, we identified several potential metamorphic protein candidates -- including the 40S ribosomal protein S30, whose conformational change is crucial for its secondary function in antimicrobial defense. By combining AI-driven protein structure prediction with statistical learning, our work provides a powerful new approach for discovering metamorphic proteins and deepens our understanding of their role in their molecular function."}

On the Stochastic Nature and Abductive Appearance of Large Language Models", "abstract": "This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation."}

This paper addresses this gap by proposing the first axiomatic theory that formally defines the essential structure, scope, and limitations of LA. Derived from the psychological definition of learning and the methodological requirements of LA, the framework consists of five axioms specifying discrete observation, experience construction, state transition, and inference. From these axioms, we derive a set of theorems and propositions that clarify the epistemological stance of LA, including the inherent unobservability of learner states, the irreducibility of temporal order, constraints on reachable states, and the impossibility of deterministically predicting future learning. We further define LA structure and LA practice as formal objects, demonstrating the sufficiency and necessity of the axioms and showing that diverse LA approaches -- such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and dashboards -- can be uniformly explained within this framework. The theory provides guiding principles for designing analytic methods and interpreting learning data while avoiding naive behaviorism and category errors by establishing an explicit theoretical inference layer between observations and states. This work positions LA as a rigorous science of state transition systems based on observability, establishing the theoretical foundation necessary for the field's maturation as a scholarly discipline."}

Modeling a DP as deterministic time evolution over a topologically ordered DAG with frontier width $\\omega$ and bounded in-degree, and assuming a max-type semiring with deterministic tie breaking, we prove that in a standard offline random-access model any such DP admits deterministic traceback in space $O(\\omega \\log T + (\\log T)^{O(1)})$ cells over a fixed finite alphabet, where $T$ is the number of states.

The framework yields near-optimal traceback bounds for asymmetric and banded sequence alignment, one-dimensional recurrences, and dynamic-programming formulations on graphs of bounded pathwidth.

At the same time, engineering education needs scalable AI tools capable of generating accurate solutions for tasks such as automated homework feedback and question-answering. This paper presents an enhanced, end-to-end circuit problem solver built on Gemini 2.5 Pro. We first benchmark Gemini on a representative set of undergraduate circuit problems and identify two major failure modes: 1) circuit-recognition hallucinations, particularly incorrect source polarity detection, and 2) reasoning-process hallucinations, such as incorrect current directions. To address recognition errors, we integrate a fine-tuned YOLO detector and OpenCV processing to isolate voltage and current sources, enabling Gemini to re-identify source polarities from cropped images with near-perfect accuracy. To reduce reasoning errors, we introduce an ngspice-based verification loop in which Gemini generates a .cir file, ngspice simulates the circuit, and discrepancies trigger iterative regeneration with optional human-in-the-loop review.

Our approach is grounded in two key insights. First, informal proofs tend to proceed via a sequence of logical transitions - often implications or equivalences - without explicitly specifying intermediate results or auxiliary lemmas. In contrast, formal systems like Lean require an explicit representation of each proof state and the tactics that connect them. Second, each informal reasoning step can be viewed as an abstract transformation between proof states, but identifying the corresponding formal tactics often requires nontrivial domain knowledge and precise control over proof context. To bridge this gap, we propose a two stage framework. Rather than generating formal tactics directly, we first extract a Chain of States (CoS), a sequence of intermediate formal proof states aligned with the logical structure of the informal argument. We then generate tactics to transition between adjacent states in the CoS, thereby constructing the full formal proof. This intermediate representation significantly reduces the complexity of tactic generation and improves alignment with informal reasoning patterns. We build dedicated datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluation, and introduce an interactive framework to support tactic generation from formal states. Empirical results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher proof success rates."}

This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies."}

Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations."}

While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: \"Contextual Blindness\". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness."}

These HID embeddings effectively learn collaborative information from historical user-item interactions, making them vulnerable to situations where most items are rarely consumed (the long-tail problem). Recent methods that incorporate auxiliary information often suffer from noisy collaborative sharing caused by co-occurrence signals or semantic homogeneity caused by flat dense embeddings. Semantic IDs (SIDs), with their capability of code sharing and multi-granular semantic modeling, provide a promising alternative. However, the collaborative overwhelming phenomenon hinders the further development of SID-based methods. The quantization mechanisms commonly compromise the uniqueness of identifiers required for modeling head items, creating a performance seesaw between head and tail items.

Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%).

However, this paradigm fundamentally shifts the auction object from discrete ad slots to the distribution over LLM outputs, posing new challenges for designing auction mechanisms. Existing mechanisms for LLM-native advertising adopt frameworks that decouple auction and generation, which either ignore externalities or require multiple LLM inferences for ad allocation, rendering them impractical for industrial scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Auction, which to the best of our knowledge is the first learning-based generative auction mechanism that integrates auction and LLM generation for LLM-native advertising. By formulating the allocation optimization as a preference alignment problem between LLM outputs and the mechanism's objective which reflects both advertisers' expected value and user experience, we introduce Iterative Reward-Preference Optimization (IRPO) algorithm that alternately optimizes the reward model and the LLM. This approach enables the LLM to inherently model allocation externalities without any extra inference cost. We further identify the allocation monotonicity and continuity of LLM-Auction, which allows us to prove that a simple first-price payment rule exhibits favorable incentive properties. Additionally, we design an LLM-as-a-judge simulation environment to facilitate large-scale data construction and enable comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the mechanism's performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LLM-Auction significantly outperforms existing baselines in allocation efficiency, while achieving the desired mechanism properties."}

To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models.

In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator."}

While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant \"popularity direction\" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

In light of this, we investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be leveraged to improve safety in multi-vehicle-following scenarios involving emergency braking. Specifically, we investigate how DRL with vehicle-to-vehicle communication can be used to ethically select an emergency breaking profile in scenarios where overall, or collective, three-vehicle harm reduction or collision avoidance shall be obtained instead of single-vehicle such. As an algorithm, we provide a hybrid approach that combines DRL with a previously published method based on analytical expressions for selecting optimal constant deceleration. By combining DRL with the previous method, the proposed hybrid approach increases the reliability compared to standalone DRL, while achieving superior performance in terms of overall harm reduction and collision avoidance."}

We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute.

Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation.

This paper presents a theoretically grounded framework for designing AI-resilient assessments, supported by formal analysis and multi-year empirical validation.We make three contributions. First, we establish two theoretical results: (1) assessments composed of interconnected problems, where outputs feed into subsequent stages, are more AI-resilient than modular assessments because current language models struggle with sustained multi-step reasoning and context; and (2) semi-structured problems with deterministic success criteria provide more reliable measures of student competency than fully open-ended projects, which allow AI systems to default to familiar solution patterns. These results challenge common policy and institutional guidance that promotes open-ended assessments as the primary safeguard for academic integrity.Second, we validate these results using data from four university data science courses (N = 138). While students achieve near-perfect scores on AI-assisted modular homework, performance drops by roughly 30 percentage points on proctored exams, indicating substantial AI score inflation. Interconnected projects remain strongly correlated with modular assessments, suggesting they measure the same underlying skills while resisting AI misuse. Proctored exams show weaker alignment, implying they may assess test-taking ability rather than intended learning outcomes.Third, we translate these findings into a practical assessment design framework. The proposed approach enables educators to create assessments that promote integrative thinking, reflect real-world AI-augmented workflows, and naturally resist trivial delegation to generative AI, thereby helping restore academic integrity."}

Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems.

Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains. We expect our benchmark to establish a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence."}

However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures."}

Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences (\"chunks\") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks.

This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes.

In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps.

In the movement process, robots need to avoid collisions with other moving robots while minimizing their travel distance. Previous methods for this problem either continuously replan paths using heuristic search methods to avoid conflicts or choose appropriate collision avoidance strategies based on learning approaches. The former may result in long travel distances due to frequent replanning, while the latter may have low learning efficiency due to low sample exploration and utilization, and causing high training costs for the model. To address these issues, we propose a path planning method, MAPPOHR, which combines heuristic search, empirical rules, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method consists of two layers: a real-time planner based on the multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, MAPPO, which embeds empirical rules in the action output layer and reward functions, and a heuristic search planner used to create a global guiding path. During movement, the heuristic search planner replans new paths based on the instructions of the real-time planner. We tested our method in 10 different conflict scenarios. The experiments show that the planning performance of MAPPOHR is better than that of existing learning and heuristic methods. Due to the utilization of empirical knowledge and heuristic search, the learning efficiency of MAPPOHR is higher than that of existing learning methods."}

In this work, we present a new constrained generation framework that takes multiple constraints as input and enables the generation of crystal structures with specific chemical and properties. In this framework, intermediate constraints, such as symmetry information and composition ratio, are generated by a constraint generator based on large language models (LLMs), which considers the target properties. These constraints are then used by a subsequent crystal structure generator to ensure that the structure generation process is under control.

These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \\to B) \\land (\\neg A \\to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \\to B) \\land (A \\to C) \\vdash A \\to (B \\land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation.

We investigate whether LLMs can predict an individual's gender based solely on online shopping histories and whether these predictions are influenced by gender biases and stereotypes. Using a dataset of historical online purchases from users in the United States, we evaluate the ability of six LLMs to classify gender and we then analyze their reasoning and products-gender co-occurrences. Results indicate that while models can infer gender with moderate accuracy, their decisions are often rooted in stereotypical associations between product categories and gender. Furthermore, explicit instructions to avoid bias reduce the certainty of model predictions, but do not eliminate stereotypical patterns. Our findings highlight the persistent nature of gender biases in LLMs and emphasize the need for robust bias-mitigation strategies."}

In this paper, we present SCAN (SemantiC Document Layout ANalysis), a novel approach that enhances both textual and visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that work with visually rich documents. It is a VLM-friendly approach that identifies document components with appropriate semantic granularity, balancing context preservation with processing efficiency. SCAN uses a coarse-grained semantic approach that divides documents into coherent regions covering contiguous components. We trained the SCAN model by fine-tuning object detection models on an annotated dataset. Our experimental results across English and Japanese datasets demonstrate that applying SCAN improves end-to-end textual RAG performance by up to 9.4 points and visual RAG performance by up to 10.4 points, outperforming conventional approaches and even commercial document processing solutions."}

Scientific tables, as core carriers of knowledge representation, combine text, symbols, and graphics, forming a typical multimodal reasoning scenario. However, existing benchmarks are mostly focused on general domains, failing to reflect the unique structural complexity and domain-specific semantics inherent in scientific research. Chemical tables are particularly representative: they intertwine structured variables such as reagents, conditions, and yields with visual symbols like molecular structures and chemical formulas, posing significant challenges to models in cross-modal alignment and semantic parsing. To address this, we propose ChemTable-a large scale benchmark of chemical tables constructed from real-world literature, containing expert-annotated cell layouts, logical structures, and domain-specific labels. It supports two core tasks: (1) table recognition (structure and content extraction); and (2) table understanding (descriptive and reasoning-based question answering). Evaluation on ChemTable shows that while mainstream multimodal models perform reasonably well in layout parsing, they still face significant limitations when handling critical elements such as molecular structures and symbolic conventions. Closed-source models lead overall but still fall short of human-level performance. This work provides a realistic testing platform for evaluating scientific multimodal understanding, revealing the current bottlenecks in domain-specific reasoning and advancing the development of intelligent systems for scientific research."}

This paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI research asking \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what conditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action, and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling \"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems, supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive principles structurally."}

AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts, extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition, explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored insights, improving transfer across tasks.

PaTAS operates in parallel with standard neural computation through Trust Nodes and Trust Functions that propagate input, parameter, and activation trust across the network. The framework defines a Parameter Trust Update mechanism to refine parameter reliability during training and an Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA) method to compute instance-specific trust at inference. Experiments on real-world and adversarial datasets demonstrate that PaTAS produces interpretable, symmetric, and convergent trust estimates that complement accuracy and expose reliability gaps in poisoned, biased, or uncertain data scenarios. The results show that PaTAS effectively distinguishes between benign and adversarial inputs and identifies cases where model confidence diverges from actual reliability. By enabling transparent and quantifiable trust reasoning within neural architectures, PaTAS provides a foundation for evaluating model reliability across the AI lifecycle."}

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel cognitive-guided MCTS framework (CogMCTS). CogMCTS tightly integrates the cognitive guidance mechanism of LLMs with MCTS to achieve efficient automated heuristic optimization. The framework employs multi-round cognitive feedback to incorporate historical experience, node information, and negative outcomes, dynamically improving heuristic generation. Dual-track node expansion combined with elite heuristic management balances the exploration of diverse heuristics and the exploitation of high-quality experience. In addition, strategic mutation modifies the heuristic forms and parameters to further enhance the diversity of the solution and the overall optimization performance.

In practice, however, DETRs generate hundreds of predictions that far outnumber the actual objects present in an image. This raises a critical question: which of these predictions could be trusted? Addressing this concern, we provide empirical and theoretical evidence that predictions within the same image play distinct roles, resulting in varying reliability levels. Our analysis reveals that DETRs employ an optimal specialist strategy: one prediction per object is trained to be well-calibrated, while the remaining predictions are trained to suppress their foreground confidence to near zero, even when maintaining accurate localization. We show that this strategy emerges as the loss-minimizing solution to the Hungarian matching algorithm, fundamentally shaping DETRs' outputs. While selecting the well-calibrated predictions is ideal, they are unidentifiable at inference time. This means that any post-processing algorithm poses a risk of outputting a set of predictions with mixed calibration levels. Therefore, practical deployment necessitates a joint evaluation of both the model's calibration quality and the effectiveness of the post-processing algorithm. However, we demonstrate that existing metrics like average precision and expected calibration error are inadequate for this task. To address this issue, we further introduce Object-level Calibration Error (OCE): This object-centric design penalizes both retaining suppressed predictions and missed ground truth foreground objects, making OCE suitable for both evaluating models and identifying reliable prediction subsets.

In this work we propose a deep learning-based framework to enable real-time video motion transfer which is critical for enabling bandwidth-efficient applications such as video conferencing, remote health monitoring, virtual reality interaction, and vision-based anomaly detection. This is done using keypoints which serve as semantically meaningful, compact representations of motion across time. To enable bandwidth savings during video transmission we perform forecasting of keypoints using two generative time series models VRNN and GRU-NF. The predicted keypoints are transformed into realistic video frames using an optical flow-based module paired with a generator network, thereby enabling efficient, low-frame-rate video transmission. Based on the application this allows the framework to either generate a deterministic future sequence or sample a diverse set of plausible futures. Experimental results demonstrate that VRNN achieves the best point-forecast fidelity (lowest MAE) in applications requiring stable and accurate multi-step forecasting and is particularly competitive in higher-uncertainty, multi-modal settings. This is achieved by introducing recurrently conditioned stochastic latent variables that carry past contexts to capture uncertainty and temporal variation. On the other hand the GRU-NF model enables richer diversity of generated videos while maintaining high visual quality. This is realized by learning an invertible, exact-likelihood mapping between the keypoints and their latent representations which supports rich and controllable sampling of diverse yet coherent keypoint sequences. Our work lays the foundation for next-generation AI systems that require real-time, bandwidth-efficient, and semantically controllable video generation."}

We identify four key research problems inherent to enabling such a decentralized infrastructure: 1) overlay network organization; 2) LLM communication privacy; 3) overlay forwarding for resource efficiency; and 4) verification of serving quality. This work presents the first systematic study of these fundamental problems in the context of decentralized LLM serving. Evaluation results from a prototype implemented on a set of decentralized nodes demonstrate that GenTorrent achieves a latency reduction of over 50% compared to the baseline design without overlay forwarding. Furthermore, the security features introduce minimal overhead to serving latency and throughput. We believe this work pioneers a new direction for democratizing and scaling future AI serving capabilities."}

The primary challenge in OCIL lies in maintaining a good balance between the knowledge of old and new classes within the continually updated model. Most existing methods rely on explicit knowledge interaction through experience replay, and often employ exclusive training separation to address bias problems. Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to achieve a well-balanced learner, as these methods often exhibit either reduced plasticity or limited stability due to difficulties in continually integrating knowledge in the OCIL setting. In this paper, we propose a novel replay-based method, called Balanced Inclusive Separation for Online iNcremental learning (BISON), which can achieve both high plasticity and stability, thus ensuring more balanced performance in OCIL. Our BISON method proposes an inclusive training separation strategy using dual classifiers so that knowledge from both old and new classes can effectively be integrated into the model, while introducing implicit approaches for transferring knowledge across the two classifiers. Extensive experimental evaluations over three widely-used OCIL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of BISON, showing more balanced yet better performance compared to state-of-the-art replay-based OCIL methods."}

However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies, time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 97.8% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available framework upon acceptance."}

Strictly equivariant models may struggle to fit the data, while unconstrained models lack a principled way to leverage partial symmetries. Even when the data is fully symmetric, enforcing equivariance can hurt training by limiting the model to a restricted region of the parameter space. Guided by homotopy principles, where an optimization problem is solved by gradually transforming a simpler problem into a complex one, we introduce Adaptive Constrained Equivariance (ACE), a constrained optimization approach that starts with a flexible, non-equivariant model and gradually reduces its deviation from equivariance. This gradual tightening smooths training early on and settles the model at a data-driven equilibrium, balancing between equivariance and non-equivariance. Across multiple architectures and tasks, our method consistently improves performance metrics, sample efficiency, and robustness to input perturbations compared with strictly equivariant models and heuristic equivariance relaxations."}

We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective? We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a clipped-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip improves accuracy by up to $+6$ absolute percentage points over DAPO. We extend our experiments to 8K context length, and RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip achieves 52% accuracy on AIME25, surpassing the official Qwen3-4B-Instruct model (47%).

Reproducibility in machine learning evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans, among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more samples from multiple raters for each example greatly increases the per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$ configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N \\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and $N$, or if one even existed, depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget."}

To address these issues we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which prevents conflicting gradients on valuable tokens by skipping negative updates while amplifying positive ones and filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold, to prevent policy collapse.

While recent approaches successfully combine Goal-Conditioned RL (GCRL) for graph construction with Conflict-Based Search (CBS) for planning, they typically rely on static edge pruning to enforce safety. This binary strategy is overly conservative, precluding feasible missions that require traversing high-risk regions, even when the aggregate risk is acceptable. To address this, we introduce a framework for Risk-Bounded Multi-Agent Path Finding (\\problem{}), where agents share a user-specified global risk budget ($\\Delta$). Rather than permanently discarding edges, our framework dynamically distributes per-agent risk budgets ($\\delta_i$) during search via an Iterative Risk Allocation (IRA) layer that integrates with a standard CBS planner. We investigate two distribution strategies: a greedy surplus-deficit scheme for rapid feasibility repair, and a market-inspired mechanism that treats risk as a priced resource to guide improved allocation. This yields a tunable trade-off wherein agents exploit available risk to secure shorter, more efficient paths, but revert to longer, safer detours under tighter budgets.

Unlike existing resources, NRCD includes detailed course metadata, allowing us to develop two standardized performance metrics: Converted Only (distance correction) and Standardized (distance, weather, and elevation adjusted). Using these standardized measures, we find that athletes with slower initial performances exhibit the greatest improvement within a season, and that race frequency is the strongest predictor of improvement. Using six machine learning models, random forest achieves the highest accuracy (r squared equals 0.92), revealing that athletes who race more frequently progress significantly faster than those who do not.

A Case Study with In-Context Representation Learning", "abstract": "The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced with test-time computation, which relies on external tools and even other deep learning models. However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality representations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised training, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization."}

We have designed our RL framework to work with channel representation of unitaries, that enables us to perform matrix operations efficiently, using integers only. We have also incorporated pruning heuristics and a canonicalization of operators, in order to reduce the search complexity. As a result, compared to previous works, we are able to implement significantly larger unitaries, in less time, with much better success rate and improvement factor. Our results for Clifford+T synthesis on two qubit unitaries achieve close-to-optimal decompositions for up to 100 T gates, 5 times more than previous RL algorithms and to the best of our knowledge, the largest instances achieved with any method to date. Our RL algorithm is able to recover previously-known optimal linear complexity algorithm for T-count-optimal decomposition of 1 qubit unitaries. We illustrate significant reduction in the asymptotic T-count estimate of important primitives like controlled cyclic shift (43%), controlled adder (14.3%) and multiplier (14%), without adding any extra ancilla.

However, the growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task. Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most effective."}

This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group, SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network, whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark. It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans, lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\\ell1$ on OmniObject3D by 14%.

Existing approaches typically embed node, edge, and graph-level features into a unified latent space, modeling prediction tasks including classification and regression as a form of conditional generation. However, due to the non-Euclidean nature of graph data, features of different curvatures are entangled in the same latent space without releasing their geometric potential. To address this issue, we aim to construt an ideal Riemannian diffusion model to capture distinct manifold signatures of complex graph data and learn their distribution. This goal faces two challenges: numerical instability caused by exponential mapping during the encoding proces and manifold deviation during diffusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GeoMancer: a novel Riemannian graph diffusion framework for both generation and prediction tasks. To mitigate numerical instability, we replace exponential mapping with an isometric-invariant Riemannian gyrokernel approach and decouple multi-level features onto their respective task-specific manifolds to learn optimal representations. To address manifold deviation, we introduce a manifold-constrained diffusion method and a self-guided strategy for unconditional generation, ensuring that the generated data remains aligned with the manifold signature.

Two activities were conducted with 33 Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore school teachers to (1) compare AI-generated scores with TA grading across three key dimensions: empathy and user understanding, identification of pain points and opportunities, and visual communication, and (2) examine teacher preferences for AI-assigned, TA-assigned, and hybrid scores. Results showed low statistical agreement between instructor and AI scores for empathy and pain points, with slightly higher alignment for visual communication. Teachers preferred TA-assigned scores in six of ten samples. Qualitative feedback highlighted the potential of AI for formative feedback, consistency, and student self-reflection, but raised concerns about its limitations in capturing contextual nuance and creative insight.

Existing methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks. Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally, the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving.

Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design."}

This intractability is worsened by the $\\textit{Lucretius problem}$, or the tendency to infer future risks only from past experience. We propose a process of $\\textit{dark speculation}$, in which systematically generating and refining catastrophic scenarios (\"qualitative\" work) is coupled with estimating their likelihoods and associated damages (quantitative underwriting analysis). The idea is neither to predict the future nor to enable insurance for its own sake, but to use narrative and underwriting tools together to generate probability distributions over outcomes. We formalize this process using a simplified catastrophic Lévy stochastic framework and propose an iterative institutional design in which (1) speculation (including scenario planning) generates detailed catastrophic event narratives, (2) insurance underwriters assign probabilistic and financial parameters to these narratives, and (3) decision-makers synthesize the results into summary statistics to inform judgment. Analysis of the model reveals the value of (a) maintaining independence between speculation and underwriting, (b) analyzing multiple risk categories in parallel, and (c) generating \"thick\" catastrophic narrative rich in causal (counterfactual) and mitigative detail.

Moreover, we exploit tangent sets to characterize optimality conditions for low-rank optimization and prove that verifying second-order optimality is NP-hard. In a separate line of analysis, we investigate variational geometry of the graph of the normal cone to matrix varieties, deriving the explicit Bouligand tangent cone, Fréchet and Mordukhovich normal cones to the graph. These results are further applied to develop optimality conditions for low-rank bilevel programs."}

Richardson", "title": "Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs)", "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping computational and network biology by enabling new approaches to decode cellular communication networks. We introduce Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs), a novel framework that models cellular signaling as a specialized molecular language, where signaling molecules function as tokens, protein interactions define syntax, and functional consequences constitute semantics. HMLMs employ a transformer-based architecture adapted to accommodate graph-structured signaling networks through information transducers, mathematical entities that capture how molecules receive, process, and transmit signals. The architecture integrates multi-modal data sources across molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention mechanisms and scale-bridging operators that enable information flow across biological hierarchies. Applied to a complex network of cardiac fibroblast signaling, HMLMs outperformed traditional approaches in temporal dynamics prediction, particularly under sparse sampling conditions. Attention-based analysis revealed biologically meaningful crosstalk patterns, including previously uncharacterized interactions between signaling pathways. By bridging molecular mechanisms with cellular phenotypes through AI-driven molecular language representation, HMLMs establish a foundation for biology-oriented large language models (LLMs) that could be pre-trained on comprehensive pathway datasets and applied across diverse signaling systems and tissues, advancing precision medicine and therapeutic discovery."}

At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization.

The Item Response Theory (IRT) has recently emerged as a promising framework for evaluating LLMs via their response accuracy. Beyond simple response accuracy, LLMs' chain of thought (CoT) lengths serve as a vital indicator of their reasoning ability. To leverage the CoT length information to assist the evaluation of LLMs, we propose Latency-Response Theory (LaRT) to jointly model the response accuracy and CoT length by introducing the latent ability, latent speed, and a key correlation parameter between them. We derive an efficient estimation algorithm and establish rigorous identifiability results for the population parameters to ensure the statistical validity of estimation. Theoretical asymptotic analyses and simulation studies demonstrate LaRT's advantages over IRT in terms of higher estimation accuracy and shorter confidence intervals for latent traits. A key finding is that the asymptotic estimation precision of the latent ability under LaRT exceeds that of IRT whenever the latent ability and latent speed are correlated. We collect real responses from diverse LLMs on popular benchmark datasets. The application of LaRT reveals a strong negative correlation between the latent ability and latent speed in all benchmarks, with stronger correlation for more difficult benchmarks. This finding supports the intuition that higher reasoning ability correlates with slower speed and longer response latency. LaRT yields different LLM rankings than IRT and outperforms IRT across multiple key evaluation metrics including predictive power, item efficiency, ranking validity, and LLM evaluation efficiency.

Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences."}

It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation."}

Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale."}

Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving \"sink\" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios. Our code is available atthis https URL"}

To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances.

These tools generate \"tortured phrases\", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. \"counterfeit consciousness\" for \"artificial intelligence\"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance. SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents."}

Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales. We conclude by noting that for cost effective, short horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder decoder architectures with targeted finetuning are preferable."}

The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias."}

Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration."}

We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries.

R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (1937) using computational text analysis. Dialogue was extracted with regular expressions, then preprocessed, and scored using the NRC-VAD lexicon to quantify emotional dimensions. The results show that the dialogue maintains a generally positive (high valence) and calm (low arousal) tone, with a gradually increasing sense of agency (dominance) as the story progresses. These patterns reflect the novel's emotional rhythm: moments of danger and excitement are regularly balanced by humor, camaraderie, and relief. Visualizations -- including emotional trajectory graphs and word clouds -- highlight how Tolkien's language cycles between tension and comfort. By combining computational tools with literary interpretation, this study demonstrates how digital methods can uncover subtle emotional structures in literature, revealing the steady rhythm and emotional modulation that shape the storytelling in The Hobbit."}

As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in emotion analysis. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based analysis of emotional arousal in two complementary data sets of human-labeled video recordings. I find that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and show little to know indication of demographic bias. However, in recordings of speakers in real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences. This study therefore underscores the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and contributes a suitable replicable framework."}

Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality.

Resident doctors often conduct initial patient assessments and create summaries for senior doctors, but their availability is constrained, resulting in extended patient wait times.This study addresses the challenge of generating concise summaries from MSEs through the evaluation of various language models. Given the scarcity of relevant mental health conversation datasets, we developed a 12-item descriptive MSE questionnaire and collected responses from 405 participants, resulting in 9720 utterances covering diverse mental health aspects.

We argue for a separation of linguistic and visual levels of meaning and introduce a spatial gesture semantics that closes this gap. Iconicity is differentiated into three aspects: Firstly, an interpretation of the form of a gesture in terms of a translation from kinematic gesture annotations into vector sequences (iconic model). Secondly, a truth-functional evaluation of the iconic model within spatially extended domains (embedding). Since a simple embedding is too strong, we identify a number of transformations that can be applied to iconic models, namely rotation, scaling, perspective fixation, and quotation of handshape. Thirdly, the linguistic description or classification of an iconic model (informational evaluation). Since the informational evaluation of an iconic gesture is a heuristic act, it needs a place in a semantic theory of visual communication. Informational evaluation lifts a gesture to a quasi-linguistic level that can interact with verbal content.

A Probability-Informed Visual Enhancement (PVE) objective masks high-frequency tokens during training, steering the Resampler to concentrate on semantically rich regions-just as skilled reader gloss over function words.

Drawing inspiration from cognitive neuroscience, which suggests that human reasoning functions largely independently of language processing, we hypothesize that LLMs similarly encode reasoning and language as separable components that can be disentangled to enhance multilingual reasoning. To evaluate this, we perform a causal intervention by ablating language-specific representations at inference time. Experiments on 10 open-weight LLMs spanning 11 typologically diverse languages show that this language-specific ablation consistently boosts multilingual reasoning performance. Layer-wise analyses further confirm that language and reasoning representations can be effectively disentangled throughout the model, yielding improved multilingual reasoning capabilities, while preserving top-layer language features remains essential for maintaining linguistic fidelity. Compared to post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, our training-free language-reasoning disentanglement achieves comparable or superior results with minimal computational overhead. These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms underlying multilingual reasoning in LLMs and suggest a lightweight and interpretable strategy for improving cross-lingual generalization."}

While recent prompt-based and offline optimization methods offer preliminary solutions, they fall short in cold-start scenarios and long-term personalization due to their inherently static and shallow designs. In this work, we introduce the Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Alignment (RLPA) framework, in which an LLM interacts with a simulated user model to iteratively infer and refine user profiles through dialogue. The training process is guided by a dual-level reward structure: the Profile Reward encourages accurate construction of user representations, while the Response Reward incentivizes generation of responses consistent with the inferred profile. We instantiate RLPA by fine-tuning Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, resulting in Qwen-RLPA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in personalized dialogue. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Qwen-RLPA consistently outperforms prompting and offline fine-tuning baselines, and even surpasses advanced commercial models such as Claude-3.5 and GPT-4o. Further analysis highlights Qwen-RLPA's robustness in reconciling conflicting user preferences, sustaining long-term personalization and delivering more efficient inference compared to recent reasoning-focused LLMs. These results emphasize the potential of dynamic profile inference as a more effective paradigm for building personalized dialogue systems."}

Human-like chat requires modeling subtle latent traits, such as emotional tone, situational awareness, and evolving personality, which are difficult to predefine and cannot be easily learned from synthetic or distillation-based data. To address these limitations, we propose a Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework, containing a variational auto-encoding module and fine-grained control space which dynamically adapts dialogue behaviour based on fine-grained, interpretable latent variables across talking style, interaction patterns, and personal attributes. We also construct a high-quality dataset, HumanChatData, and benchmark HumanChatBench to address the scarcity of high-quality data in the human-like domain.

This capability has implications for security and accountability in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method -- prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace. This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving 2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on 16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than previously known."}

We propose a reliability estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks, we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation."}

In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization."}

Our benchmarks reveal that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe prompts while maintaining robust safety protections.

Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next, we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments. TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval models."}

We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that inserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all pre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies and increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original functionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation, which maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented initialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative Adaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to acquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as SCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and SCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing between preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography benchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion while still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean corpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and competitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best overall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when preservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and adaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning setups."}

Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts.

We investigate whether LLMs can predict an individual's gender based solely on online shopping histories and whether these predictions are influenced by gender biases and stereotypes. Using a dataset of historical online purchases from users in the United States, we evaluate the ability of six LLMs to classify gender and we then analyze their reasoning and products-gender co-occurrences. Results indicate that while models can infer gender with moderate accuracy, their decisions are often rooted in stereotypical associations between product categories and gender.

These features are highly interpretable because of their close relationship with human articulatory processes and are expected to be more difficult for deepfake models to replicate. The results demonstrate that certain segmental features commonly used in forensic voice comparison (FVC) are effective in identifying deep-fakes, whereas some global features provide little value. These findings underscore the need to approach audio deepfake detection using methods that are distinct from those employed in traditional FVC, and offer a new perspective on leveraging segmental features for this purpose. In addition, the present study proposes a speaker-specific framework for deepfake detection, which differs fundamentally from the speaker-independent systems that dominate current benchmarks. While speaker-independent frameworks aim at broad generalization, the speaker-specific approach offers advantages in forensic contexts where case-by-case interpretability and sensitivity to individual phonetic realization are essential."}

KL regularization is ubiquitous, yet the design surface, choice of KL direction (forward vs. reverse), normalization (normalized vs. unnormalized), and estimator ($k_1/k_2/k_3$), is scattered across the literature and often intertwined with off-policy estimation. We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective? We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a clipped-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip improves accuracy by up to $+6$ absolute percentage points over DAPO. We extend our experiments to 8K context length, and RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip achieves 52% accuracy on AIME25, surpassing the official Qwen3-4B-Instruct model (47%). Notably, RPG is a stable and scalable RL algorithm for LLM reasoning, realized via (a) a KL-correct objective, (b) clipped importance sampling, and (c) an iterative reference-policy update scheme."}

Scientific tables, as core carriers of knowledge representation, combine text, symbols, and graphics, forming a typical multimodal reasoning scenario. However, existing benchmarks are mostly focused on general domains, failing to reflect the unique structural complexity and domain-specific semantics inherent in scientific research. Chemical tables are particularly representative: they intertwine structured variables such as reagents, conditions, and yields with visual symbols like molecular structures and chemical formulas, posing significant challenges to models in cross-modal alignment and semantic parsing. To address this, we propose ChemTable-a large scale benchmark of chemical tables constructed from real-world literature, containing expert-annotated cell layouts, logical structures, and domain-specific labels. It supports two core tasks: (1) table recognition (structure and content extraction); and (2) table understanding (descriptive and reasoning-based question answering). Evaluation on ChemTable shows that while mainstream multimodal models perform reasonably well in layout parsing, they still face significant limitations when handling critical elements such as molecular structures and symbolic conventions. Closed-source models lead overall but still fall short of human-level performance. This work provides a realistic testing platform for evaluating scientific multimodal understanding, revealing the current bottlenecks in domain-specific reasoning and advancing the development of intelligent systems for scientific research."}

Homan", "title": "Forest vs Tree: The $(N, K)$ Trade-off in Reproducible ML Evaluation", "abstract": "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans, among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more samples from multiple raters for each example greatly increases the per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$ configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N \\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and $N$, or if one even existed, depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget."}

To address these issues we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which prevents conflicting gradients on valuable tokens by skipping negative updates while amplifying positive ones and filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold, to prevent policy collapse. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, as validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH, AIME 2024, AIME 2025 and AMC 2023."}

We present UltraCUA, a foundation model that transcends this limitation through hybrid action-seamlessly unifying primitive GUI operations with high-level tool execution.

Second, a synthetic data engine produces 17,000+ verifiable tasks capturing real-world computer-use complexity. Third, comprehensive hybrid action trajectory collection incorporates both GUI primitives and strategic tool calls.

This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect.

In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions.

However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. Notably, our conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models."}

Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\\sim$5 accuracy points.

However, directly predicting millions of Gaussian parameters at once remains highly error-sensitive: small inaccuracies in positions or other attributes lead to noticeable blurring, particularly in fine structures such as text. In parallel, implicit representation methods such as LVSM and LaCT have demonstrated significantly higher rendering fidelity by compressing scene information into model weights rather than explicit Gaussians, and decoding RGB frames using the full transformer or TTT backbone. However, this computationally intensive decompression process for every rendered frame makes real-time rendering infeasible.

We address these questions with Long-LRM++, a model that adopts a semi-explicit scene representation combined with a lightweight decoder. Long-LRM++ matches the rendering quality of LaCT on DL3DV while achieving real-time 14 FPS rendering on an A100 GPU, overcoming the speed limitations of prior implicit methods.

While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model.

How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction.

This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens.

While recent methods achieve impressive results, most rely on fixed skeletal templates, which prevent them from generalizing to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics. Given a text prompt and a target skeleton, our method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions, and further enables cross-species motion style transfer."}

While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: \"Contextual Blindness\". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers.

However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility. We evaluate CoherentGS through both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes, using as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views.

However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios."}

However, the autoregressive Transformer architecture used by MLLMs requries tokenization on input images, which limits their ability to accurately ground objects within the 2D image space. This raises an important question: how can sequential language tokens be improved to better ground objects in 2D spatial space for MLLMs? To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GETok achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings."}

However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, achieving nearly 30% accuracy on the unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data."}

Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment.

Specifically, we curate MMEndo, a multimodal endoscopic dataset comprising expert-annotated colonoscopy image-text pairs. We fine-tune the Qwen2-VL-7B backbone using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA) and align it with clinical standards via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments show that our LDP outperforms existing baselines on both automated metrics and rigorous clinical expert evaluations (achieving a Physician Score of 7.2/10), significantly reducing training computational costs by 833x compared to full fine-tuning. The proposed solution offers a scalable, clinically viable path for primary healthcare, with additional validation on the IU-XRay dataset confirming its robustness."}

However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches.

We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \\textit{global} \\revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \\emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved.

When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the robustness of existing methods but also exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility."}

Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence.

Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that 3D priors are necessary, demonstrating that a data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers a more scalable, efficient and effective path for future autonomous driving systems."}

To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations.

A Progressive Investigation", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation. Code is released atthis https URL."}

This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256.

The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data.

To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \\textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \\emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations.

In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism.

In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety.

We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints.

To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking.

We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets.

Through this exploration, we introduce $\\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \\mathrm{erf}(\\alpha x + s)$, where $\\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures."}

Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation (\"1-NFE\") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm."}

However, existing methods that use the individual features to momentum update the cluster memory will fluctuate over the training examples, especially for the outlier samples. Unlike the individual-based updating mechanism, the centroid-based updating mechanism that applies the mean feature of each cluster to update the cluster memory can reduce the impact of individual samples. Therefore, we formulate the individual-based updating and centroid-based updating mechanisms in a unified cluster contrastive framework, named Dual Cluster Contrastive framework (DCC), which maintains two types of memory banks: individual and centroid cluster memory banks. Significantly, the individual cluster memory considers just one individual at a time to take a single step for updating. The centroid cluster memory applies the mean feature of each cluster to update the corresponding cluster memory. During optimization, besides the vallina contrastive loss of each memory, a cross-view consistency constraint is applied to exchange the benefits of two memories for generating a discriminative description for the object ReID. Note that DCC can be easily applied for unsupervised or supervised object ReID by using ground-truth labels or the generated pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, \\emph{e.g.,} Market-1501, MSMT17, and VeRi-776, under \\textbf{supervised Object ReID} and \\textbf{unsupervised Object ReID} demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DCC."}

While convenient, ensuring the integrity and security of online exams remains challenging, as traditional invigilation struggles to effectively monitor multiple student video feeds in real time. In this paper, we present iExam, an effective online exam proctoring and analysis system that combines lightweight face detection and deep recognition. iExam employs real-time face detection to assist invigilators in continuously monitoring student presence, and leverages deep face recognition for post-exam video analysis to identify abnormal behaviors--including face disappearance, face rotation, and identity substitution. To realize this system, we address three core challenges: (i) designing a lightweight approach to efficiently capture and analyze exam video streams in real time; (ii) developing an enhanced OCR method to automatically extract student identities from dynamically positioned Zoom name tags, enabling reliable ground truth labeling without manual intervention; and (iii) optimizing the training and inference pipeline to significantlyreduce resource and time requirements on ordinary teacher devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that iExam achieves 90.4% accuracy for real-time face detection and 98.4% accuracy for post-exam face recognition, while maintaining low overhead.

It is also unclear which design principle -- architecture, training data, or training regime -- would have the greatest impact on these emergent properties. To investigate these issues, we systematically evaluated over 30 state-of-the-art networks with varying network architectures, training datasets, and training regimes for the presence or absence of brain-like properties. Our main findings are as follows. First, network architecture had the strongest impact on brain-like properties compared to dataset and training regime variations.

In this paper, we show that precise and controllable lighting can be achieved without any additional training, simply by supplying a coarse shadow hint for the object. Indeed, we show that injecting only the desired shadow of the object into a pre-trained diffusion-based neural renderer enables it to accurately shade the object according to the desired light position, while properly harmonizing the object (and its shadow) within the target background image. Our method, SpotLight, is entirely training-free and leverages existing neural rendering approaches to achieve controllable relighting. We show that SpotLight achieves superior object compositing results, both quantitatively and perceptually, as confirmed by a user study, outperforming existing diffusion-based models specifically designed for relighting.

In practice, however, DETRs generate hundreds of predictions that far outnumber the actual objects present in an image. This raises a critical question: which of these predictions could be trusted? Addressing this concern, we provide empirical and theoretical evidence that predictions within the same image play distinct roles, resulting in varying reliability levels. Our analysis reveals that DETRs employ an optimal specialist strategy: one prediction per object is trained to be well-calibrated, while the remaining predictions are trained to suppress their foreground confidence to near zero, even when maintaining accurate localization. We show that this strategy emerges as the loss-minimizing solution to the Hungarian matching algorithm, fundamentally shaping DETRs' outputs. While selecting the well-calibrated predictions is ideal, they are unidentifiable at inference time. This means that any post-processing algorithm poses a risk of outputting a set of predictions with mixed calibration levels. Therefore, practical deployment necessitates a joint evaluation of both the model's calibration quality and the effectiveness of the post-processing algorithm. However, we demonstrate that existing metrics like average precision and expected calibration error are inadequate for this task. To address this issue, we further introduce Object-level Calibration Error (OCE): This object-centric design penalizes both retaining suppressed predictions and missed ground truth foreground objects, making OCE suitable for both evaluating models and identifying reliable prediction subsets. Finally, we present a post hoc uncertainty quantification framework that predicts per-image model accuracy."}

In stage 1, an auto-encoder is trained to compress an image into a latent space; in stage 2, a generative model is trained to learn a distribution over that latent space. This reveals a fundamental trade-off, do we compress more aggressively to make the latent distribution easier for the stage 2 model to learn even if it makes reconstruction worse? We study this problem in the context of discrete, auto-regressive image generation. Through the lens of scaling laws, we show that smaller stage 2 models can benefit from more compressed stage 1 latents even if reconstruction performance worsens, demonstrating that generation modeling capacity plays a role in this trade-off. Diving deeper, we rigorously study the connection between compute scaling and the stage 1 rate-distortion trade-off. Next, we introduce Causally Regularized Tokenization (CRT), which uses knowledge of the stage 2 generation modeling procedure to embed useful inductive biases in stage 1 latents. This regularization improves stage 2 generation performance better by making the tokens easier to model without affecting the stage 1 compression rate and marginally affecting distortion: we are able to improve compute efficiency 2-3$\\times$ over baseline. Finally, we use CRT with further optimizations to the visual tokenizer setup to result in a generative pipeline that matches LlamaGen-3B generation performance (2.18 FID) with half the tokens per image (256 vs. 576) and a fourth the total model parameters (775M vs. 3.1B) while using the same architecture and inference procedure."}

In this work we propose a deep learning-based framework to enable real-time video motion transfer which is critical for enabling bandwidth-efficient applications such as video conferencing, remote health monitoring, virtual reality interaction, and vision-based anomaly detection. This is done using keypoints which serve as semantically meaningful, compact representations of motion across time. To enable bandwidth savings during video transmission we perform forecasting of keypoints using two generative time series models VRNN and GRU-NF. The predicted keypoints are transformed into realistic video frames using an optical flow-based module paired with a generator network, thereby enabling efficient, low-frame-rate video transmission. Based on the application this allows the framework to either generate a deterministic future sequence or sample a diverse set of plausible futures. Experimental results demonstrate that VRNN achieves the best point-forecast fidelity (lowest MAE) in applications requiring stable and accurate multi-step forecasting and is particularly competitive in higher-uncertainty, multi-modal settings. This is achieved by introducing recurrently conditioned stochastic latent variables that carry past contexts to capture uncertainty and temporal variation. On the other hand the GRU-NF model enables richer diversity of generated videos while maintaining high visual quality. This is realized by learning an invertible, exact-likelihood mapping between the keypoints and their latent representations which supports rich and controllable sampling of diverse yet coherent keypoint sequences. Our work lays the foundation for next-generation AI systems that require real-time, bandwidth-efficient, and semantically controllable video generation."}

Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to address this issue in an unsupervised manner, yet existing methods, which rely on self-supervision, are prone to an inherent self-referential feedback loop that amplifies initial prediction errors, leading to model drift. We revisit this limitation and propose Test-Time Distillation (TTD), which reframes adaptation as a distillation process guided by a frozen Vision-Language Model (VLM) as an external signal. While promising, we find that direct distillation is fraught with two pitfalls: the Generalist Trap, where the VLM's broad but non-specialized knowledge leads to suboptimal performance on specific tasks and shifts, and the Entropy Bias, where naive model fusion techniques based on entropy fail due to the disparate calibration of heterogeneous models. These pitfalls motivate our insight: the key is to build a robust supervisory signal and leverage it to guide the target model toward stable adaptation.

CoDiRe first constructs a robust blended teacher by dynamically fusing the predictions of the VLM and the target model. Critically, it circumvents the Entropy Bias by leveraging Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) as a more reliable confidence metric for weighting each model's expertise. Then applies an Optimal Transport based rectification to further align predictions with the blended teacher, enabling continuous and stable adaptation.

Inspired by our empirical observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text, visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2, Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also conducted to fully asses our method.

To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively evaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related to counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest detection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting result-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality assessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity assessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image acquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude. Notably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis method to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity assessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for pest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information related to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into a regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to comprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and quantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting confidence through a model.

This is because large inter-frame motions will increase the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively, the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label.

The proposed pipeline is evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape, on-campus and indoor scenarios. The experimental evaluation discusses the potential of these small models on edge devices, with particular emphasis on challenges, weaknesses, inherent model biases and the application of the gained information.

However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally, a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic inspection in industrial environments."}

However, simply cascading restoration and SR struggle to bridge their inherent conflict: removal aims to remove high-frequency weather-induced noise, while SR aims to hallucinate high-frequency textures from existing details, leading to inconsistent restoration contents.

In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework.

The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance."}

This study presents a controlled comparison of sixteen architectures spanning convolutional, hybrid, and transformer families for subclinical keratoconus detection from three-dimensional anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). The results demonstrate that hierarchical architectures achieve 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity, particularly in the difficult subclinical regime, outperforming both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and global-attention Vision Transformer (ViT) baselines. Mechanistic analyses indicate that this advantage arises from spatial scale alignment: hierarchical windowing produces effective receptive fields matched to the intermediate extent of subclinical abnormalities, avoiding the excessive locality observed in convolutional models and the diffuse integration characteristic of pure global attention. Attention-distance measurements show that subclinical cases require longer spatial integration than healthy or overtly pathological volumes, with hierarchical models exhibiting lower variance and more anatomically coherent focus. Representational similarity further indicates that hierarchical attention learns a distinct feature space that balances local structure sensitivity with flexible long-range interactions. Auxiliary age and sex prediction tasks demonstrate moderately high cross-task consistency, supporting the generalizability of these inductive principles.

To address these limitations, we propose EvoIR, an AiOIR-specific framework that introduces evolutionary frequency modulation for dynamic and adaptive image restoration. Specifically, EvoIR employs the Frequency-Modulated Module (FMM) that decomposes features into high- and low-frequency branches in an explicit manner and adaptively modulates them to enhance both structural fidelity and fine-grained details. Central to EvoIR, an Evolutionary Optimization Strategy (EOS) iteratively adjusts frequency-aware objectives through a population-based evolutionary process, dynamically balancing structural accuracy and perceptual fidelity. Its evolutionary guidance further mitigates gradient conflicts across degradation and accelerates convergence. By synergizing FMM and EOS, EvoIR yields greater improvements than using either component alone, underscoring their complementary roles. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that EvoIR outperforms state-of-the-art AiOIR methods."}

In this work, we revisit the WSI-language modeling paradigm and show that tile-level features exhibit strong global and local redundancy, whereas only a small subset of tiles are truly task-relevant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce an efficient MLLM framework, called LoC-Path, that replaces the expensive slide-level encoder with redundancy-reducing modules. We first design a Sparse Token Merger (STM) and an MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into a compact slide-level representation set.

We investigate whether embedding taxonomic hierarchy into neural network architectures can improve both accuracy and error locality.We introduce DiatomCascadeNet (H-COFGS), a hierarchical convolutional network with five cascaded heads that jointly predict class, order, family, genus, and species. Each head receives shared backbone features and probability distributions from higher levels, with binary masks restricting predictions to valid descendants during training and inference. Using a filtered dataset of 1,456 diatom images covering 82 species, we compare hierarchical and flat models under identical settings.H-COFGS matches flat baselines at the species level (69.4% accuracy) while outperforming at all upper taxonomic levels. When species predictions fail, errors remain taxonomically local: 92.5% of misclassified species are correctly predicted at the genus level, versus 67.2% for flat baselines. H-COFGS reduces mean taxonomic distance by 38.2% (1.209 vs. 1.955).Progressive training reveals bidirectional mechanisms: hierarchical constraint masks operate top-down to constrain prediction space, while gradients from fine-grained levels propagate bottom-up through the shared backbone, refining features.

Many defense methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, traditional poisoning attacks are not as threatening as commonly believed. This is because they often cause differences in how the model performs on the training set compared to the validation set. Such inconsistency can alert defenders that their data has been poisoned, allowing them to take the necessary defensive actions. In this paper, we introduce a more threatening type of poisoning attack called the Deferred Poisoning Attack. This new attack allows the model to function normally during the training and validation phases but makes it very sensitive to evasion attacks or even natural noise. We achieve this by ensuring the poisoned model's loss function has a similar value as a normally trained model at each input sample but with a large local curvature. A similar model loss ensures that there is no obvious inconsistency between the training and validation accuracy, demonstrating high stealthiness. On the other hand, the large curvature implies that a small perturbation may cause a significant increase in model loss, leading to substantial performance degradation, which reflects a worse robustness. We fulfill this purpose by making the model have singular Hessian information at the optimal point via our proposed Singularization Regularization term. We have conducted both theoretical and empirical analyses of the proposed method and validated its effectiveness through experiments on image classification tasks. Furthermore, we have confirmed the hazards of this form of poisoning attack under more general scenarios using natural noise, offering a new perspective for research in the field of security."}

These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control.

A Probability-Informed Visual Enhancement (PVE) objective masks high-frequency tokens during training, steering the Resampler to concentrate on semantically rich regions-just as skilled reader gloss over function words. On eleven in-context learning benchmarks, Vist achieves the same accuracy with 2.3 times fewer tokens, cutting FLOPs by 16% and memory by 50%. This method delivers remarkable results, outperforming the strongest text encoder-based compression method CEPE by 7.6% on average over benchmarks like TriviaQA, NQ, PopQA, NLUI, and CLIN, setting a new standard for token efficiency in LLMs. The project is atthis https URL."}

However, most work in gesture recognition remains rooted in reference frame-dependent representations. This poses a challenge when reference frames vary due to different work cell layouts, imprecise frame calibrations, or other environmental changes. This paper investigated the use of invariant trajectory descriptors for robust hand palm motion gesture recognition under reference frame changes. First, a novel dataset of recorded Hand Palm Motion (HPM) gestures is introduced. The motion gestures in this dataset were specifically designed to be distinguishable without dependence on specific reference frames or directional cues. Afterwards, multiple invariant trajectory descriptor approaches were benchmarked to assess how their performances generalize to this novel HPM dataset. After this offline benchmarking, the best scoring approach is validated for online recognition by developing a real-time Proof of Concept (PoC). In this PoC, hand palm motion gestures were used to control the real-time movement of a manipulator arm. The PoC demonstrated a high recognition reliability in real-time operation, achieving an $F_1$-score of 92.3%. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the invariant descriptor approach as a standalone solution. Moreover, we believe that the invariant descriptor approach can also be utilized within other state-of-the-art pattern recognition and learning systems to improve their robustness against reference frame variations."}

However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment.

In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems.

However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection.

This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources.

This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards. As a result, GenMimic can mimic human actions from noisy, generated videos. We curate GenMimicBench, a synthetic human-motion dataset generated using two video generation models across a spectrum of actions and contexts, establishing a benchmark for assessing zero-shot generalization and policy robustness.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a scalable solution for learning landing site features across diverse visual and environmental conditions. While perception-driven landing has been shown in simulation, real-world deployment introduces significant challenges.

This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones.

The global availability of large-scale viral sequence data presents significant opportunities for computational analysis; however, existing approaches face notable limitations. Phylogenetic tree-based methods are computationally intensive and do not scale efficiently to today's multi-million-sequence datasets. Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\\%.

In this paper, we argue that the i.i.d. setting can and should be reframed in terms of exchangeability, a strictly more general symmetry principle. We present the implications of this reframing, alongside two core arguments: (1) a conceptual argument, based on extending the dependency of experimental causal inference on exchangeability to causal discovery; and (2) an empirical argument, showing that many existing i.i.d. causal-discovery methods are predicated on exchangeability assumptions, and that the sole extensive widely-used real-world \"i.i.d.\" benchmark (the Tübingen dataset) consists mainly of exchangeable (and not i.i.d.) examples. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset that enforces only the exchangeability assumption, without imposing the stronger i.i.d. assumption. We show that our exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors the statistical structure of the real-world \"i.i.d.\" dataset more closely than all other i.i.d. synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the predictive capability of this dataset by proposing a neural-network-based causal-discovery algorithm trained exclusively on our synthetic dataset, and which performs similarly to other state-of-the-art i.i.d. methods on the real-world benchmark."}

Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. These results indicate that CIEGAD serves as a practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving alignment with real-world data."}

Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \\textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \\textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction.

In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline.

However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework. Physical insights is further incorporated as a regularization term to ensure that the alignment results adhere to known physical knowledge. Next, within the multi-source transfer GP model, a sparsity penalty is imposed on the transfer coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively select the most informative source outputs and suppress negative transfer. Extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of our R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics."}

Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction."}

Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences.

We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\\% in Hartford and 13.8\\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution.

Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors.Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion.Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations."}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process. Comprehensive experiments across several MuJoCo control problems validate the superior effectiveness of UACER, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall performance, stability, and efficiency."}

Standard methods, often relying on a fixed data-mixing ratio, struggle to manage the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences. Our extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves the final performance of various O2O RL algorithms, highlighting the importance of an adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design."}

Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space.

We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^{\\beta}$ with $\\beta<\\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $\\beta$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution.

Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms.

We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness.

Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date."}

However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior."}

Beyond their interpretability benefits, counterfactuals can also be leveraged for model reconstruction, where a surrogate model is trained to replicate the behavior of a target model. In this work, we demonstrate that model reconstruction can be significantly improved by recognizing that counterfactuals, which typically lie close to the decision boundary, can serve as informative though less representative samples for both classes. This is particularly beneficial in settings with limited access to labeled data. We propose a method that integrates original data samples with counterfactuals to approximate class prototypes using the Wasserstein barycenter, thereby preserving the underlying distributional structure of each class. This approach enhances the quality of the surrogate model and mitigates the issue of decision boundary shift, which commonly arises when counterfactuals are naively treated as ordinary training instances. Empirical results across multiple datasets show that our method improves fidelity between the surrogate and target models, validating its effectiveness."}

However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures."}

The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation.

Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences (\"chunks\") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks.

In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps.

BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures.

It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories."}

Despite its advantages, AUROC is not always ideal, particularly for problems that are invariant to local exchange of classes (LxC), a new form of metric invariance introduced in this work. To address this limitation, we propose LxCIM (LxC-invariant metric), which is not only rank-based and invariant under local exchange of classes, but also intuitive, logically consistent, and always computable, while enabling more detailed analysis through the cumulative accuracy-decision rate curve. Moreover, LxCIM exhibits clear theoretical connections to AUROC, accuracy, and the area under the accuracy-decision rate curve (AUDRC). These relationships allow for multiple complementary interpretations: as a symmetric form of AUROC, a rank-based analogue of accuracy, or a more representative and more interpretable variant of AUDRC.

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data."}

A key limitation is that ML methods struggle to incorporate the physics governing the scattering process, which are typically inferred implicitly from the training data or loosely enforced via architectural design. In this paper, we present a method that endows a machine learning framework with explicit knowledge of problem physics, in the form of a differentiable solver representing the forward model. The proposed method progressively refines reconstructions of the scattering potential using measurements at increasing wave frequencies, following a classical strategy to stabilize recovery.

Our approach augments a Whisper-based audio captioning model with a learned confidence prediction head that estimates uncertainty from decoder hidden states. We employ CLAP audio-text embeddings and sentence transformer similarities (FENSE) to define semantic correctness, enabling Expected Calibration Error (ECE) computation that reflects true caption quality rather than surface-level text overlap. Experiments on Clotho v2 demonstrate that confidence-guided beam search with semantic evaluation achieves dramatically improved calibration (CLAP-based ECE of 0.071) compared to greedy decoding baselines (ECE of 0.488), while simultaneously improving caption quality across standard metrics.

However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios.

The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations.

John", "title": "Design Space Exploration of DMA based Finer-Grain Compute Communication Overlap", "abstract": "As both ML training and inference are increasingly distributed, parallelization techniques that shard (divide) ML model across GPUs of a distributed system, are often deployed. With such techniques, there is a high prevalence of data-dependent communication and computation operations where communication is exposed, leaving as high as 1.7x ideal performance on the table. Prior works harness the fact that ML model state and inputs are already sharded, and employ careful overlap of individual computation/communication shards. While such coarse-grain overlap is promising, in this work, we instead make a case for finer-grain compute-communication overlap which we term FiCCO, where we argue for finer-granularity, one-level deeper overlap than at shard-level, to unlock compute/communication overlap for a wider set of network topologies, finer-grain dataflow and more. We show that FiCCO opens up a wider design space of execution schedules than possible at shard-level alone. At the same time, decomposition of ML operations into smaller operations (done in both shard-based and finer-grain techniques) causes operation-level inefficiency losses. To balance the two, we first present a detailed characterization of these inefficiency losses, then present a design space of FiCCO schedules, and finally overlay the schedules with concomitant inefficiency signatures. Doing so helps us design heuristics that frameworks and runtimes can harness to select bespoke FiCCO schedules based on the nature of underlying ML operations. Finally, to further minimize contention inefficiencies inherent with operation overlap, we offload communication to GPU DMA engines. We evaluate several scenarios from realistic ML deployments and demonstrate that our proposed bespoke schedules deliver up to 1.6x speedup and our heuristics provide accurate guidance in 81% of unseen scenarios."}

Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\\sim$5 accuracy points.

Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale."}

It is designed to model complex, uncertain systems whose random outputs are strongly non-Gaussian given deterministic inputs. The architecture itself is a random object stochastically generated by a latent anisotropic Gaussian random field defined on a compact, boundaryless, multiply-connected manifold. The goal is to establish a novel conceptual and mathematical framework in which neural architectures are realizations of a geometry-aware, field-driven generative process. Both the neural topology and synaptic weights emerge jointly from a latent random field. A reduced-order parameterization governs the spatial intensity of an inhomogeneous Poisson process on the manifold, from which neuron locations are sampled. Input and output neurons are identified via extremal evaluations of the latent field, while connectivity is established through geodesic proximity and local field affinity. Synaptic weights are conditionally sampled from the field realization, inducing stochastic output responses even for deterministic inputs. To ensure scalability, the architecture is sparsified via percentile-based diffusion masking, yielding geometry-aware sparse connectivity without ad hoc structural assumptions. Supervised learning is formulated as inference on the generative hyperparameters of the latent field, using a negative log-likelihood loss estimated through Monte Carlo sampling from single-observation-per-input datasets. The paper initiates a mathematical analysis of the model, establishing foundational properties such as well-posedness, measurability, and a preliminary analysis of the expressive variability of the induced stochastic mappings, which support its internal coherence and lay the groundwork for a broader theory of geometry-driven stochastic learning."}

These datasets are typically characterized by consistent data distributions and heuristic or partially noisy labels. In this study, we systematically evaluate two representative DL models-ReVeal and LineVul-across four representative datasets: Juliet, Devign, BigVul, and ICVul. Each model is trained independently on each respective dataset, and their code representations are analyzed using t-SNE to uncover vulnerability related patterns.

Assuming that the hyperspectral image follows the linear mixing model with the pure-pixel assumption, we develop a data reduction technique that removes pixels that do not contain endmembers. We analyze the theoretical properties of this reduction step and show that it preserves pixels that lie close to the endmembers.

However, this paradigm fundamentally shifts the auction object from discrete ad slots to the distribution over LLM outputs, posing new challenges for designing auction mechanisms. Existing mechanisms for LLM-native advertising adopt frameworks that decouple auction and generation, which either ignore externalities or require multiple LLM inferences for ad allocation, rendering them impractical for industrial scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Auction, which to the best of our knowledge is the first learning-based generative auction mechanism that integrates auction and LLM generation for LLM-native advertising. By formulating the allocation optimization as a preference alignment problem between LLM outputs and the mechanism's objective which reflects both advertisers' expected value and user experience, we introduce Iterative Reward-Preference Optimization (IRPO) algorithm that alternately optimizes the reward model and the LLM. This approach enables the LLM to inherently model allocation externalities without any extra inference cost. We further identify the allocation monotonicity and continuity of LLM-Auction, which allows us to prove that a simple first-price payment rule exhibits favorable incentive properties. Additionally, we design an LLM-as-a-judge simulation environment to facilitate large-scale data construction and enable comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the mechanism's performance.

We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales.

In particular, the scheme utilizes a backdoor learning framework to intrinsically lock a model's utility, such that it performs normally only in the presence of a specific trigger (e.g., a hardware fingerprint).

To further enhance the security of the proposed authority scheme, the certifiable robustness is integrated to prevent an adaptive attacker from removing the implanted backdoor.

Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture.

In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety.

We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints.

Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems.

In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably."}

Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation.

To cope with the increased luminosity, being able to efficiently group jets according to their origin along the beamline is crucial, particularly at the trigger level. In this work, a novel uncertainty-aware jet regression model based on a Deep Sets architecture is introduced, DIPz, to regress on a jet origin position along the beamline. The inputs to the DIPz algorithm are the charged particle tracks associated to each jet. An event-level discriminant, the Maximum Log Product of Likelihoods (MLPL), is constructed by combining the DIPz per-jet predictions.

We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort."}

However, the performance and efficiency of PC$^2$ can still be degraded with high-dimensional parameter spaces, limited data availability, or unrepresentative training data. To address this problem, this study explores two complementary enhancements to the PC$^2$ framework. First, a numerically efficient constrained optimization solver, straightforward updating of Lagrange multipliers (SULM), is adopted as an alternative to the conventional KKT solver. The SULM method significantly reduces computational cost when solving physically constrained problems with high-dimensionality and derivative boundary conditions that require a large number of virtual points. Second, a D-optimal sampling strategy is utilized to select informative virtual points to improve the stability and achieve the balance of accuracy and efficiency of the PC$^2$.

In this work, we pursue a new direction of modeling wireless network under randomized medium access control by developing an analytical network digital twin (NDT) that predicts link duty cycles from network context. We generalize randomized contention as finding a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) on the conflict graph using weighted Luby's algorithm, derive an analytical model of link duty cycles, and introduce an iterative procedure that resolves the circular dependency among duty cycle, link capacity, and contention probability.

We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings.

We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics.The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge."}

Many defense methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, traditional poisoning attacks are not as threatening as commonly believed. This is because they often cause differences in how the model performs on the training set compared to the validation set. Such inconsistency can alert defenders that their data has been poisoned, allowing them to take the necessary defensive actions. In this paper, we introduce a more threatening type of poisoning attack called the Deferred Poisoning Attack. This new attack allows the model to function normally during the training and validation phases but makes it very sensitive to evasion attacks or even natural noise. We achieve this by ensuring the poisoned model's loss function has a similar value as a normally trained model at each input sample but with a large local curvature. A similar model loss ensures that there is no obvious inconsistency between the training and validation accuracy, demonstrating high stealthiness. On the other hand, the large curvature implies that a small perturbation may cause a significant increase in model loss, leading to substantial performance degradation, which reflects a worse robustness. We fulfill this purpose by making the model have singular Hessian information at the optimal point via our proposed Singularization Regularization term. We have conducted both theoretical and empirical analyses of the proposed method and validated its effectiveness through experiments on image classification tasks. Furthermore, we have confirmed the hazards of this form of poisoning attack under more general scenarios using natural noise, offering a new perspective for research in the field of security."}

Chamon,Mathias Niepert", "title": "Learning (Approximately) Equivariant Networks via Constrained Optimization", "abstract": "Equivariant neural networks are designed to respect symmetries through their architecture, boosting generalization and sample efficiency when those symmetries are present in the data distribution. Real-world data, however, often departs from perfect symmetry because of noise, structural variation, measurement bias, or other symmetry-breaking effects. Strictly equivariant models may struggle to fit the data, while unconstrained models lack a principled way to leverage partial symmetries. Even when the data is fully symmetric, enforcing equivariance can hurt training by limiting the model to a restricted region of the parameter space. Guided by homotopy principles, where an optimization problem is solved by gradually transforming a simpler problem into a complex one, we introduce Adaptive Constrained Equivariance (ACE), a constrained optimization approach that starts with a flexible, non-equivariant model and gradually reduces its deviation from equivariance. This gradual tightening smooths training early on and settles the model at a data-driven equilibrium, balancing between equivariance and non-equivariance. Across multiple architectures and tasks, our method consistently improves performance metrics, sample efficiency, and robustness to input perturbations compared with strictly equivariant models and heuristic equivariance relaxations."}

KL regularization is ubiquitous, yet the design surface, choice of KL direction (forward vs. reverse), normalization (normalized vs. unnormalized), and estimator ($k_1/k_2/k_3$), is scattered across the literature and often intertwined with off-policy estimation. We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective? We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a clipped-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip improves accuracy by up to $+6$ absolute percentage points over DAPO. We extend our experiments to 8K context length, and RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip achieves 52% accuracy on AIME25, surpassing the official Qwen3-4B-Instruct model (47%).

We show that if trained with the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent \"entropic forces\" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in representation learning.

This study aims to dynamically manage drivers' acceptance of Discount Express from the perspective of an individual platform. The lack of historical data under the new business model necessitates online learning.

One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more samples from multiple raters for each example greatly increases the per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$ configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N \\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and $N$, or if one even existed, depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget."}

We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete action and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when to initiate the maneuver. The MDP models decision rewards using analytical models of collision risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. By deciding to maneuver earlier than conventional methods, the Markov policy effectively favors CAMs that achieve comparable rates of collision risk reduction while consuming less propellant. Using historical data of tracked conjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive parameter-sensitivity study. When evaluated on synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy consumes significantly less propellant overall and per maneuver in comparison to a conventional cut-off policy that initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA).

We study the role of the outer optimizer in Local SGD, and prove new convergence guarantees for the algorithm. In particular, we show that tuning the outer learning rate allows us to (a) trade off between optimization error and stochastic gradient noise variance, and (b) make up for ill-tuning of the inner learning rate. Our theory suggests that the outer learning rate should sometimes be set to values greater than $1$. We extend our results to settings where we use momentum in the outer optimizer, and we show a similar role for the momentum-adjusted outer learning rate. We also study acceleration in the outer optimizer and show that it improves the convergence rate as a function of the number of communication rounds, improving upon the convergence rate of prior algorithms that apply acceleration locally. Finally, we also introduce a novel data-dependent analysis of Local SGD that yields further insights on outer learning rate tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments with standard language models and various outer optimizers to validate our theory."}

While current AI-driven medical research predominantly focuses on knowledge graphs or natural text pretraining paradigms to incorporate medical knowledge, these approaches primarily rely on implicitly encoded knowledge within model parameters, neglecting task-specific knowledge required by diverse downstream tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis (RAD), a novel framework that explicitly injects external knowledge into multimodal models directly on downstream tasks. Specifically, RAD operates through three key mechanisms: retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from multiple medical sources, a guideline-enhanced contrastive loss that constrains the latent distance between multi-modal features and guideline knowledge, and the dual transformer decoder that employs guidelines as queries to steer cross-modal fusion, aligning the models with clinical diagnostic workflows from guideline acquisition to feature extraction and decision-making. Moreover, recognizing the lack of quantitative evaluation of interpretability for multimodal diagnostic models, we introduce a set of criteria to assess the interpretability from both image and text perspectives. Extensive evaluations across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, RAD enables the model to concentrate more precisely on abnormal regions and critical indicators, ensuring evidence-based, trustworthy diagnosis. Our code is available atthis https URL."}

However, the growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task. Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related data points are explained by only a few shared concepts.

Existing approaches typically embed node, edge, and graph-level features into a unified latent space, modeling prediction tasks including classification and regression as a form of conditional generation. However, due to the non-Euclidean nature of graph data, features of different curvatures are entangled in the same latent space without releasing their geometric potential. To address this issue, we aim to construt an ideal Riemannian diffusion model to capture distinct manifold signatures of complex graph data and learn their distribution. This goal faces two challenges: numerical instability caused by exponential mapping during the encoding proces and manifold deviation during diffusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GeoMancer: a novel Riemannian graph diffusion framework for both generation and prediction tasks. To mitigate numerical instability, we replace exponential mapping with an isometric-invariant Riemannian gyrokernel approach and decouple multi-level features onto their respective task-specific manifolds to learn optimal representations. To address manifold deviation, we introduce a manifold-constrained diffusion method and a self-guided strategy for unconditional generation, ensuring that the generated data remains aligned with the manifold signature.

To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features, enriching its predictions.

ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design."}

Prior work has proposed a range of heuristics to counteract this effect, but these methods are ad hoc: they frequently trade off correctness for diversity, their effectiveness varies across tasks, and in some cases they even contradict one another. In this work, we place these observations on a rigorous foundation. We first provide a formal proof of why RL fine-tuning exhibits diversity collapse via a selection and reinforcement bias. Next, we make a key observation that any reward modification to address diversity collapse only needs to be applied on the correct trajectories. Building directly on this analysis, we introduce a principled method -- differential smoothing -- that provably improves both correctness and diversity, outperforming vanilla RL as well as widely used entropy-based heuristics. Our theory precisely characterizes when existing heuristics help and why they fail, while showing that differential smoothing is universally superior. Extensive experiments with models from 1B to 7B parameters, across domains including CountDown and real-world mathematical reasoning, demonstrate consistent gains. Differential smoothing improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k, with up to 6.7% improvements on AIME24 dataset."}

Feature propagation (FP) is a well-known method that performs well for imputation of missing node features on graphs, but it still has the following three issues: 1) it struggles with graphs that are not fully connected, 2) imputed features face the over-smoothing problem, and 3) FP is tailored for transductive tasks, overlooking the feature distribution shift in inductive tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce DDFI, a Diverse and Distribution-aware Missing Feature Imputation method that combines feature propagation with a graph-based Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) in a nontrivial manner. It first designs a simple yet effective algorithm, namely Co-Label Linking (CLL), that randomly connects nodes in the training set with the same label to enhance the performance on graphs with numerous connected components. Then we develop a novel two-step representation generation process at the inference stage. Specifically, instead of directly using FP-imputed features as input during inference, DDFI further reconstructs the features through the whole MAE to reduce feature distribution shift in the inductive tasks and enhance the diversity of node features. Meanwhile, since existing feature imputation methods for graphs only evaluate by simulating the missing scenes with manually masking the features, we collect a new dataset called Sailing from the records of voyages that contains naturally missing features to help better evaluate the effectiveness. Extensive experiments conducted on six public datasets and Sailing show that DDFI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under both transductive and inductive settings."}

In the movement process, robots need to avoid collisions with other moving robots while minimizing their travel distance. Previous methods for this problem either continuously replan paths using heuristic search methods to avoid conflicts or choose appropriate collision avoidance strategies based on learning approaches. The former may result in long travel distances due to frequent replanning, while the latter may have low learning efficiency due to low sample exploration and utilization, and causing high training costs for the model. To address these issues, we propose a path planning method, MAPPOHR, which combines heuristic search, empirical rules, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method consists of two layers: a real-time planner based on the multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, MAPPO, which embeds empirical rules in the action output layer and reward functions, and a heuristic search planner used to create a global guiding path. During movement, the heuristic search planner replans new paths based on the instructions of the real-time planner. We tested our method in 10 different conflict scenarios.

Their relational schemas pose unique challenges to synthetic data generation for privacy-preserving data sharing, e.g., for collaborative analytical and data mining tasks, as well as software testing at various scales. Relational schemas typically include a set of primary and foreign key constraints to specify the intra-and inter-table entity relations, which also imply crucial intra-and inter-table data correlations in the RDBs. Existing synthetic RDB generation approaches often focus on the relatively simple and basic parent-child relations, failing to address the ubiquitous real-world complexities in relational schemas in key constraints like composite keys, intra-table correlations like sequential correlation, and inter-table data correlations like indirectly connected tables. In this paper, we introduce incremental relational generator (IRG), a modular framework designed to handle these real-world challenges. In IRG, each table is generated by learning context from a depth-first traversal of relational connections to capture indirect inter-table relationships and constructs different parts of a table through several classical generative and predictive modules to preserve complex key constraints and data correlations.

These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations.

In stage 1, an auto-encoder is trained to compress an image into a latent space; in stage 2, a generative model is trained to learn a distribution over that latent space. This reveals a fundamental trade-off, do we compress more aggressively to make the latent distribution easier for the stage 2 model to learn even if it makes reconstruction worse? We study this problem in the context of discrete, auto-regressive image generation. Through the lens of scaling laws, we show that smaller stage 2 models can benefit from more compressed stage 1 latents even if reconstruction performance worsens, demonstrating that generation modeling capacity plays a role in this trade-off. Diving deeper, we rigorously study the connection between compute scaling and the stage 1 rate-distortion trade-off. Next, we introduce Causally Regularized Tokenization (CRT), which uses knowledge of the stage 2 generation modeling procedure to embed useful inductive biases in stage 1 latents. This regularization improves stage 2 generation performance better by making the tokens easier to model without affecting the stage 1 compression rate and marginally affecting distortion: we are able to improve compute efficiency 2-3$\\times$ over baseline. Finally, we use CRT with further optimizations to the visual tokenizer setup to result in a generative pipeline that matches LlamaGen-3B generation performance (2.18 FID) with half the tokens per image (256 vs. 576) and a fourth the total model parameters (775M vs. 3.1B) while using the same architecture and inference procedure."}

Existing convergence bounds for SGMs in the W2-distance rely on stringent assumptions about the data distribution. In this work, we present a novel framework for analyzing W2-convergence in SGMs, significantly relaxing traditional assumptions such as log-concavity and score regularity. Leveraging the regularization properties of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process, we show that weak log-concavity of the data distribution evolves into log-concavity over time. This transition is rigorously quantified through a PDE-based analysis of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation governing the log-density of the forward process. Moreover, we establish that the drift of the time-reversed OU process alternates between contractive and non-contractive regimes, reflecting the dynamics of concavity. Our approach circumvents the need for stringent regularity conditions on the score function and its estimators, relying instead on milder, more practical assumptions. We demonstrate the wide applicability of this framework through explicit computations on Gaussian mixture models, illustrating its versatility and potential for broader classes of data distributions."}

This gap becomes critical as the quadratic complexity of full attention renders them impractical on large-scale graphs. Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as brain-inspired models, provided an energy-saving scheme to convert input intensity into discrete spike-based representations through event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired by these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer with Spiking Node Tokenization (GT-SNT) for node classification. By integrating multi-step feature propagation with SNNs, spiking node tokenization generates compact, locality-aware spike count embeddings as node tokens to avoid predefined codebooks and their utilization issues. The codebook guided self-attention leverages these tokens to perform node-to-token attention for linear-time global context aggregation.

Despite-or perhaps, because of-this workload diversity and unpredictable request information (e.g., response lengths and dependencies), existing request schedulers have focused on aggregate performance, unable to ensure application-level SLO needs.This paper presents JITServe, the first SLO-aware LLM serving system designed to maximize service goodput (e.g., the number of tokens meeting request SLOs) across diverse workloads. JITServe novelly schedules requests using imprecise request information and gradually relaxes this conservatism by refining request information estimates as generation progresses. It applies a grouped margin goodput maximization algorithm to allocate just enough serving bandwidth to satisfy each request's SLO just-in-time (JIT), maximizing residual capacity for others, while deciding the composition of requests in a batch to maximize efficiency and goodput with provable guarantees. Our evaluation across diverse realistic workloads, including chat, deep research, and agentic pipelines, shows that JITServe improves service goodput by 1.4x-6.3x, alternatively achieving 28.5%-83.2% resource savings, compared to state-of-the-art designs."}

This study introduces the Voice Quality Assessment Network (VOQANet), a deep learning framework that employs an attention mechanism and Speech Foundation Model (SFM) embeddings to extract high-level features. To further enhance performance, we propose VOQANet+, which integrates self-supervised SFM embeddings with low-level acoustic descriptors-namely jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR).

This challenge becomes even more complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning (CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building thermal dynamics is still missing.Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy.

To address this limitation, we introduce the National Running Club Database (NRCD), the first openly available dataset to aggregate 23,725 race results from 7,594 collegiate club athletes across the 2023-2025 seasons. Unlike existing resources, NRCD includes detailed course metadata, allowing us to develop two standardized performance metrics: Converted Only (distance correction) and Standardized (distance, weather, and elevation adjusted). Using these standardized measures, we find that athletes with slower initial performances exhibit the greatest improvement within a season, and that race frequency is the strongest predictor of improvement. Using six machine learning models, random forest achieves the highest accuracy (r squared equals 0.92), revealing that athletes who race more frequently progress significantly faster than those who do not. At the team level, programs whose athletes race at least four times during the regular season have substantially higher odds of placing in the top 15 at nationals (chi-squared less than 0.01). These results challenge common coaching practices that favor minimal racing before championship meets.

This is primarily because the dynamic programming foundations are technically challenging and only partially understood, with several fundamental questions remaining open. This paper steps toward a general framework for average-reward robust MDPs by analyzing the constant-gain setting. We study the average-reward robust control problem with possible information asymmetries between the controller and an S-rectangular adversary. Our analysis centers on the constant-gain robust Bellman equation, examining both the existence of solutions and their relationship to the optimal average reward. Specifically, we identify when solutions to the robust Bellman equation characterize the optimal average reward and stationary policies, and we provide one-sided weak communication conditions ensuring solutions' existence.

Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(\\sigma^4)$ and $O(\\sigma^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Ampère equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \\[ \\mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + \\sigma^2 \\nabla \\log q(y), \\] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \\[ \\mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\nabla \\log q(y), \\] \\[ \\mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\nabla \\log q(y) - \\frac{\\sigma^4}{8} \\nabla \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\| \\nabla \\log q(y) \\|^2 + \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla \\log q(y) \\right) . \\]"}

In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level. This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources. Experiments on the DAIC-WoZ dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, paving the way for broader clinical applications beyond mental health."}

Conventional evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and precision, fail to appropriately capture uncertainty or the reliability of model predictions, particularly under adversarial or degraded conditions. This paper introduces the Parallel Trust Assessment System (PaTAS), a framework for modeling and propagating trust in neural networks using Subjective Logic (SL). PaTAS operates in parallel with standard neural computation through Trust Nodes and Trust Functions that propagate input, parameter, and activation trust across the network. The framework defines a Parameter Trust Update mechanism to refine parameter reliability during training and an Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA) method to compute instance-specific trust at inference. Experiments on real-world and adversarial datasets demonstrate that PaTAS produces interpretable, symmetric, and convergent trust estimates that complement accuracy and expose reliability gaps in poisoned, biased, or uncertain data scenarios. The results show that PaTAS effectively distinguishes between benign and adversarial inputs and identifies cases where model confidence diverges from actual reliability. By enabling transparent and quantifiable trust reasoning within neural architectures, PaTAS provides a foundation for evaluating model reliability across the AI lifecycle."}

The framework also accommodates the intersection of a low-rank set and another set satisfying mild assumptions, thereby yielding a tangent intersection rule.

In these tasks we demonstrate speedups ranging from 3x to 100x over varying-sized neural baselines, and comparable to FastText model inference during the data curation task.

To study this, we test two Claude models that frequently appear in top-performing agents submitted to the benchmark. We ask them to find relevant files using only issue text, and then issue text plus file paths. We then run the same setup on BeetleBox and SWE-rebench. Despite both benchmarks involving popular open-source Python projects, models performed 3 times better on SWE-Bench-Verified. They were also 6 times better at finding edited files, without any additional context about the projects themselves. This gap suggests the models may have seen many SWE-Bench-Verified tasks during training. As a result, scores on this benchmark may not reflect an agent's ability to handle real software issues, yet it continues to be used in ways that can misrepresent progress and lead to choices that favour agents that use certain models over strong agent design.

To address these challenges, we propose UniCoR, a novel self-supervised framework that learns Unified Code Representations framework designed to learn unified and robust code representations.

What tortuous paths do users experience during the interaction process? How well do the LLMs follow instructions? Are users satisfied? In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis on human-LLM coding collaboration using LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat datasets to explore the human-LLM collaboration mechanism, LLMs' instruction following ability, and human satisfaction. This study yields interesting findings: 1) Task types shape interaction patterns(linear, star and tree), with code quality optimization favoring linear patterns, design-driven tasks leaning toward tree structures, and queries preferring star patterns; 2) Bug fixing and code refactoring pose greater challenges to LLMs' instruction following, with non-compliance rates notably higher than in information querying; 3) Code quality optimization and requirements-driven development tasks show lower user satisfaction, whereas structured knowledge queries and algorithm designs yield higher levels.

Specifically, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have forced the community to focus on users' data privacy. Despite the vast amount of data on developer issues available in GitHub repositories, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the issues developers of Open Source Software discuss to comply with privacy legislation. Method: In this work, we examine such discussions by mining and analyzing 32,820 issues from GitHub repositories. We partially analyzed the dataset automatically to identify law user rights and principles indicated, and manually analyzed a sample of 1,186 issues based on the type of concern addressed. Results: We devised 24 discussion categories placed in six clusters: features/bugs, consent-related, documentation, data storing/sharing, adaptability, and general compliance. Our results show that developers mainly focus on specific user rights from the legislation (right to erasure, right to opt-out, right to access), addressing other rights less frequently, while most discussions concern user consent, user rights functionality, bugs and cookies management. Conclusion: The created taxonomy can help practitioners understand which issues are discussed for law compliance, so that they ensure they address them first in their systems. In addition, the educational community can reshape curricula to better educate future engineers on the privacy law concerns raised, and the research community can identify gaps and areas for improvement to support and accelerate data privacy law compliance."}

To support this mapping, we employ a modular construction strategy in which vertically composed IP blocks implement the behavioral protocols expressed in software. A direct syntactic translation, however, cannot meet hardware-level efficiency or communication constraints. For this reason, we leverage formal type systems based on sequences that check whether interactions between hardware modules adhere to the communication patterns described in the software model. We further examine hardware interconnect strategies for composing many such modules and develop layout techniques suited to this object-aligned design style. Together, these contributions preserve mental continuity from software to chip design for new learners and enables practical layout generation, ultimately reducing the expertise required for software developers to participate in chip creation."}

Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale."}

Recent work suggests that both graph neural network (GNN)-based and transformer-based models, including large language models (LLMs), yield promising results when evaluated on curated benchmark datasets. These datasets are typically characterized by consistent data distributions and heuristic or partially noisy labels. In this study, we systematically evaluate two representative DL models-ReVeal and LineVul-across four representative datasets: Juliet, Devign, BigVul, and ICVul. Each model is trained independently on each respective dataset, and their code representations are analyzed using t-SNE to uncover vulnerability related patterns. To assess realistic applicability, we deploy these models along with four pretrained LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-o3-mini, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 on a curated dataset, VentiVul, comprising 20 recently (May 2025) fixed vulnerabilities from the Linux kernel. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle to distinguish vulnerable from non-vulnerable code in representation space and generalize poorly across datasets with differing distributions. When evaluated on VentiVul, our newly constructed time-wise out-of-distribution dataset, performance drops sharply, with most models failing to detect vulnerabilities reliably. These results expose a persistent gap between academic benchmarks and real-world deployment, emphasizing the value of our deployment-oriented evaluation framework and the need for more robust code representations and higher-quality datasets."}

Human visual attention refers to the mechanical processes by which we selectively process and prioritize information. Visual attention is important to study because it is central to what information people (who are sighted) use to solve a particular problem. Meanwhile, memory bugs are among the most common types of bugs in C programs that manifest as a variety of program faults. In this paper, we study human visual attention while people attempt to locate memory bugs in code. We recruit 21 programmers to locate between one and eight memory bugs in three C programs for 1.5-2 hours each. In total we collected observations of 31 hours of programmer effort. The bugs in our study cover memory leaks, overflows, and double frees, which are among the most common memory bugs. We analyze the task outcomes in terms of success rate and related factors, patterns of visual attention overall such as what lines and functions are read, and finally we explore differences of visual attention patterns during success versus failure cases."}

LLM-based autonomous agents in software engineering rely on large, proprietary models, limiting local deployment. This has spurred interest in Small Language Models (SLMs), but their practical effectiveness and efficiency within complex agentic frameworks for automated issue resolution remain poorly understood.Goal. We investigate the performance, energy efficiency, and resource consumption of four leading agentic issue resolution frameworks when deliberately constrained to using SLMs. We aim to assess the viability of these systems for this task in resource-limited settings and characterize the resulting trade-offs.Method. We conduct a controlled evaluation of four leading agentic frameworks (SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover) using two SLMs (Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B) on the SWE-bench Verified Mini benchmark. On fixed hardware, we measure energy, duration, token usage, and memory over 150 runs per configuration.Results. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption. The most energy-intensive framework, AutoCodeRover (Gemma), consumed 9.4x more energy on average than the least energy-intensive, OpenHands (Gemma). However, this energy is largely wasted. Task resolution rates were near-zero, demonstrating that current frameworks, when paired with SLMs, consume significant energy on unproductive reasoning loops. The SLM's limited reasoning was the bottleneck for success, but the framework's design was the bottleneck for efficiency.Conclusions. Current agentic frameworks, designed for powerful LLMs, fail to operate efficiently with SLMs. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption, but this energy is largely wasted due to the SLMs' limited reasoning. Viable low-energy solutions require shifting from passive orchestration to architectures that actively manage SLM weaknesses."}

However, applying them to arbitrary functions (especially internal functions) \\textit{at scale} remains challenging due to the requirement of sophisticated contextual information, such as specification, dependencies, and usage examples. State-of-the-art methods heavily rely on static or incomplete context provisioning, causing failure of generating functional harnesses. Furthermore, LLMs tend to exploit harness validation metrics, producing plausible yet logically useless code. % Therefore, harness generation across large and diverse projects continues to face challenges in reliable compilation, robust code retrieval, and comprehensive validation.To address these challenges, we present HarnessAgent, a tool-augmented agentic framework that achieves fully automated, scalable harness construction over hundreds of OSS-Fuzz targets. HarnessAgent introduces three key innovations: 1) a rule-based strategy to identify and minimize various compilation errors; 2) a hybrid tool pool for precise and robust symbol source code retrieval; and 3) an enhanced harness validation pipeline that detects fake definitions. We evaluate HarnessAgent on 243 target functions from OSS-Fuzz projects (65 C projects and 178 C++ projects). It improves the three-shot success rate by approximately 20\\% compared to state-of-the-art techniques, reaching 87\\% for C and 81\\% for C++. Our one-hour fuzzing results show that more than 75\\% of the harnesses generated by HarnessAgent increase the target function coverage, surpassing the baselines by over 10\\%. In addition, the hybrid tool-pool system of HarnessAgent achieves a response rate of over 90\\% for source code retrieval, outperforming Fuzz Introspector by more than 30\\%."}
