Reject-option prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios, limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable decisions."}

We introduce real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses, and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise, effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency.

This paper examines the interplay between KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window (e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence. Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial \"gist\") can yield more coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and view \"cache health\" holistically beyond mere size."}

Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first \"think\" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior."}

To overcome the challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for generating the final response.

Soft prompts, as carefully crafted modules that efficiently adapt vision-language models to specific tasks, necessitate effective copyright protection. In this paper, we investigate model copyright protection by auditing whether suspicious third-party models incorporate protected soft prompts. While this can be viewed as a special case of model ownership auditing, our analysis shows that existing techniques are ineffective due to prompt learning's unique characteristics. Non-intrusive auditing is inherently prone to false positives when independent models share similar data distributions with victim models. Intrusive approaches also fail: backdoor methods designed for CLIP cannot embed functional triggers, while extending traditional DNN backdoor techniques to prompt learning suffers from harmfulness and ambiguity challenges. We find that these failures in intrusive auditing stem from the same fundamental reason: watermarking operates within the same decision space as the primary task yet pursues opposing objectives. Motivated by these findings, we propose sequential watermarking for soft prompts (SWAP), which implants watermarks into a different and more complex space. SWAP encodes watermarks through a specific order of defender-specified out-of-distribution classes, inspired by the zero-shot prediction capability of CLIP.

Current training sample influence estimation methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work, we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR) that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect. Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior knowledge in the field."}

This paper is the first to systematically investigate MIA against CDMs. We introduce a novel and realistic grey box threat model that exploits the explainability features of these platforms, where a model's internal knowledge state vectors are exposed to users through visualizations such as radar charts. We demonstrate that these vectors can be accurately reverse-engineered from such visualizations, creating a potent attack surface. Based on this threat model, we propose a profile-based MIA (P-MIA) framework that leverages both the model's final prediction probabilities and the exposed internal knowledge state vectors as features. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets against mainstream CDMs show that our grey-box attack significantly outperforms standard black-box baselines.

To address this, this study introduces the Trustworthiness Calibration Framework (TCF), a reproducible methodology for evaluating phishing detectors across three dimensions: calibration, consistency, and robustness.

This work introduces a novel knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection.

To avoid the prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++ optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones ($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals, $\\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer $\\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \\textit{Condition Preference Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\\%$ error rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\\%$ in human pose, and consistent $2$--$5\\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps."}

However, two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation. Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering.

We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily induced and modulated."}

Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a 17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers, while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively."}

However, the generalizability of these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities, providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models.

This predict-then-optimize paradigm has motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer, often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c) as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity, and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training time.

We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything. Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks, BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700 question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens) documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits increase with document length.

Existing passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent. Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under challenging manipulation scenarios."}

To investigate this, we introduce the Moral RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful'' and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned models performing particularly poorly.

Public speaking is a necessary skill for future engineers as they have to communicate technical knowledge with diverse stakeholders. While universities offer courses or workshops, they are unable to offer sustained and personalized training to students. Providing comprehensive feedback on both verbal and non-verbal aspects of public speaking is time-intensive, making consistent and individualized assessment impractical. This study integrates research on verbal and non-verbal cues in public speaking to develop an AI-driven assessment model for engineering students. Our approach combines speech analysis, computer vision, and sentiment detection into a multi-modal AI system that provides assessment and feedback. The model evaluates (1) verbal communication (pitch, loudness, pacing, intonation), (2) non-verbal communication (facial expressions, gestures, posture), and (3) expressive coherence, a novel integration ensuring alignment between speech and body language. Unlike previous systems that assess these aspects separately, our model fuses multiple modalities to deliver personalized, scalable feedback. Preliminary testing demonstrated that our AI-generated feedback was moderately aligned with expert evaluations. Among the state-of-the-art AI models evaluated, all of which were Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini and OpenAI models, Gemini Pro emerged as the best-performing, showing the strongest agreement with human annotators. By eliminating reliance on human evaluators, this AI-driven public speaking trainer enables repeated practice, helping students naturally align their speech with body language and emotion, crucial for impactful and professional communication."}

Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks.

The benchmark comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating large language models, especially in underrepresented languages.

The rise of open-source RISC-V architectures has created new opportunities for domain-specific GPU design. Unlike traditional proprietary GPUs, emerging RISC-V-based GPUs provide flexible, programmable platforms suitable for custom computation models such as HDC. In this study, we design and implement custom GPU instructions optimized for HDC operations, enabling efficient processing for hybrid HDC-CNN workloads.

In the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain) adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE, particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments. To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.) from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation network, by removing static objects including background components. To further boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map. Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework, PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable performance improvements in MDE during TTA."}

They enable high-level architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation. Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation. This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability."}

For instance, NatureLM achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise.

While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies.

Rodrigues", "title": "A multimodal multiplex of the mental lexicon for multilingual individuals", "abstract": "Historically, bilingualism was often perceived as an additional cognitive load that could hinder linguistic and intellectual development. However, over the last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies have aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word recognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel activation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll et al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer network principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants' proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?"}

As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into everyday technologies, AI literacy - the ability to evaluate AI systems, communicate with them, and understand their broader impacts - has emerged as a critical skill across disciplines. Yet effective, scalable approaches for teaching these concepts in higher education remain limited, particularly for students outside STEM fields.To address this gap, we developed AI User, an interactive online curriculum that introduces core AI concepts through scenario - based activities set in real - world contexts. This study presents findings from four focus groups with instructors who engaged with AI User materials and participated in structured feedback activities. Thematic analysis revealed that instructors valued exploratory tasks that simulated real - world AI use cases and fostered experimentation, while also identifying challenges related to scaffolding, accessibility, and multi-modal support. A ranking task for instructional support materials showed a strong preference for interactive demonstrations over traditional educational materials like conceptual guides or lecture slides.These findings offer insights into instructor perspectives on making AI concepts more accessible and relevant for broad learner audiences. They also inform the design of AI literacy tools that align with diverse teaching contexts and support critical engagement with AI in higher education."}

For flexibility, agentic RAG employs autonomous, multi-round retrieval and reasoning to resolve queries. Although recent agentic RAG has improved via reinforcement learning, they often incur substantial token overhead from search and reasoning processes. This trade-off prioritizes accuracy over efficiency. To address this issue, this work proposes TeaRAG, a token-efficient agentic RAG framework capable of compressing both retrieval content and reasoning steps. 1) First, the retrieved content is compressed by augmenting chunk-based semantic retrieval with a graph retrieval using concise triplets. A knowledge association graph is then built from semantic similarity and co-occurrence. Finally, Personalized PageRank is leveraged to highlight key knowledge within this graph, reducing the number of tokens per retrieval. 2) Besides, to reduce reasoning steps, Iterative Process-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO) is proposed. Specifically, our reward function evaluates the knowledge sufficiency by a knowledge matching mechanism, while penalizing excessive reasoning steps. This design can produce high-quality preference-pair datasets, supporting iterative DPO to improve reasoning conciseness. Across six datasets, TeaRAG improves the average Exact Match by 4% and 2% while reducing output tokens by 61% and 59% on Llama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, respectively.

In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment. To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the number of interaction episodes.

This paper presents MPRF, a multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions.

This leaves a noticeable gap in assessing someone's AI literacy for real-world job use. We propose a work-task-oriented assessment model for AI literacy which is grounded in the competencies required for effective use of AI tools in professional settings. We describe the development of a novel AI literacy assessment instrument, and accompanying formative assessments, in the context of a US Navy robotics training program. The program included training in robotics and AI literacy, as well as a competition with practical tasks and a multiple choice scenario task meant to simulate use of AI in a job setting. We found that, as a measure of applied AI literacy, the competition's scenario task outperformed the tests we adopted from past research or developed ourselves. We argue that when training people for AI-related work, educators should consider evaluating them with instruments that emphasize highly contextualized practical skills rather than abstract technical knowledge, especially when preparing workers without technical backgrounds for AI-integrated roles."}

In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV, filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU.

Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result, LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5% (from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems and agentic AI research."}

We show that this is not an inherent failure but an artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying representational geometry of the knowledge being modified."}

Agent Spec defines a common set of components, control and data flow semantics, and schemas that allow an agent to be defined once and executed across different runtimes. Agent Spec also introduces a standardized Evaluation harness to assess agent behavior and agentic workflows across runtimes - analogous to how HELM and related harnesses standardized LLM evaluation - so that performance, robustness, and efficiency can be compared consistently across frameworks. We demonstrate this using four distinct runtimes (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and WayFlow) evaluated over three different benchmarks (SimpleQA Verified, $\\tau^2$-Bench and BIRD-SQL). We provide accompanying toolsets: a Python SDK (PyAgentSpec), a reference runtime (WayFlow), and adapters for popular frameworks (e.g., LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI). Agent Spec bridges the gap between model-centric and agent-centric standardization & evaluation, laying the groundwork for reliable, reusable, and portable agentic systems."}

Specifically, we assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents. Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence."}

While large language models now approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines, we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), which rethinks human reasoning simulation along three dimensions: (i) from averaged to individualized reasoning, (ii) from behavioral mimicry to cognitive alignment, and (iii) from vignette-based to open-ended data. The benchmark evaluates whether a model can predict a specific person's behavioral responses and the underlying reasoning dynamics in out-of-distribution scenarios, given partial evidence of their prior views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a human track that automates and scales the think-aloud method to collect ecologically valid human reasoning data, and a synthetic track for further scalability and systematic stress testing. This architecture enables low-cost, extensible expansion to new tasks and populations. Experiments with state-of-the-art language models reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the individuality of human thought.

We define PIF as a task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options, each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation, content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity."}

In this work, we study how agents do human work by presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering, computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and misuse of advanced tools.

We introduce a scalable framework that decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM).

Through a fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level, the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base.

The main finding is that by endowing both preys and predators with the capability of making predictions based on linear extrapolation a novel sort of dynamic equilibrium appears, where both species co-exist while both populations grow indefinitely. While this broadly confirms that, in general, relatively simple agents favor the emergence of complex collective behavior, it also suggests that one fundamental mechanism is that the capability of individuals to take first-order derivatives of one other's behavior can allow the collective computation of derivatives of any order."}

Days with similar demand patterns are grouped in clusters using an unsupervised learning algorithm and these clusters are used to partition the memory.

Our extensive evaluation highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation affordance achieves competitive performance and even outperforms some other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot action trajectories with flow matching leads to consistently favorable results in several robot manipulation benchmarks than some alternative behavior cloning methods.

To address this gap, this work introduces a new benchmark, named MMDocIR, that encompasses two distinct tasks: page-level and layout-level retrieval. The former evaluates the performance of identifying the most relevant pages within a long document, while the later assesses the ability of detecting specific layouts, providing a more fine-grained measure than whole-page analysis. A layout refers to a variety of elements, including textual paragraphs, equations, figures, tables, or charts. The MMDocIR benchmark comprises a rich dataset featuring 1,685 questions annotated by experts and 173,843 questions with bootstrapped labels, making it a valuable resource in multimodal document retrieval for both training and evaluation.

Traditional approaches often require extensive domain expertise and feature engineering. While large language models, with their vast scientific knowledge, circumvent the feature engineering limitations, they lack the calibrated uncertainty estimates required for high-stakes decision making. Hence, current optimization methods force a choice between domain knowledge and reliability, with no principled approach that affords both. In this work, we show that training language models through the uncertainty-aware objectives of traditional optimization methods enables their use as reliable optimizers guided by natural language. By teaching LLMs from experimental outcomes under uncertainty, we transform their overconfidence from a fundamental limitation into a precise calibration mechanism. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reactions, a cornerstone of pharmaceutical synthesis, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-yielding reaction conditions, from 24% to 43% in 50 experimental iterations starting from 10 unsuccessful conditions. Across 19 diverse optimization problems spanning organic synthesis, materials science and catalysis, process chemistry, and molecular design, our approach ranks first on average, establishing a new paradigm for reliable, uncertainty-guided optimization with LLMs. Our approach can accelerate discovery by lowering the barrier to using powerful optimization methods, replacing the need for domain-specific feature engineering with more accessible natural language interfaces.

For this reason, commercial LLMs typically undergo a sophisticated censoring mechanism to eliminate any harmful output they could possibly produce. These mechanisms maintain the integrity of LLM alignment by guaranteeing that the models respond safely and ethically. In response to this, attacks on LLMs are a significant threat to such protections, and many previous approaches have already demonstrated their effectiveness across diverse domains. Existing LLM attacks mostly adopt a generate-and-test strategy to craft malicious input. To improve the comprehension of censoring mechanisms and design a targeted attack, we propose an Explainable-AI solution that comparatively analyzes the behavior of censored and uncensored models to derive unique exploitable alignment patterns.

In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization.

To address these shortcomings, we propose RCCDA: a dynamic model update policy that optimizes ML training dynamics while ensuring compliance to predefined resource constraints, utilizing only past loss information and a tunable drift threshold. In developing our policy, we analytically characterize the evolution of model loss under concept drift with arbitrary training update decisions. Integrating these results into a Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework produces a lightweight greedy-optimal policy that provably limits update frequency and cost.

However, all existing diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at the scale of even simple molecular systems.

PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems, Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically lower energy function evaluations.

In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM proba- bilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability."}

This paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast, when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system. Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver mobility."}

Conventional empirical, physics-based, and standard machine learning models rely on oversimplified assumptions or intensive feature engineering, constraining their capacity to model long-term dependencies and intricate feature interactions. To address these issues, this study presents a new deep learning Hybrid LSTM-Trans-Mixer-Att framework that first processes input data through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling cycles. Subsequently, an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization refines the features. Concurrently, a parallel Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block introduced facilitates efficient cross-feature interaction modeling of static and categorical parameters, including lithological indices and mud properties. The feature representations extracted from the Enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer modules are integrated through a dedicated fusion layer. Finally, an adaptive attention mechanism then dynamically assigns contextual weights to salient features, enhancing discriminative representation learning and enabling high-fidelity ROP prediction. The proposed framework combines sequential memory, static feature interactions, global context learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution for the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Experimental validation on real-world drilling datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving an Rsquare of 0.9991 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly outperforming existing baseline and hybrid models."}

At the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level motion targets. A dynamic, risk-sensitive Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies learning from rare but critical, high-risk events.

To address these issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance understanding.

In this work, we provide a systematic study of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses.

This also limits large-scale benchmarking of such solutions. Automated vulnerability injection provides a way to directly address these dataset limitations, but existing techniques remain limited in coverage, contextual fidelity, or injection success rates. In this paper, we present AVIATOR, the first AI-agentic vulnerability injection workflow. It automatically injects realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities for high-fidelity, diverse, large-scale vulnerability dataset generation. Unlike prior monolithic approaches, AVIATOR orchestrates specialized AI agents, function agents and traditional code analysis tools that replicate expert reasoning. It combines semantic analysis, injection synthesis enhanced with LoRA-based fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, as well as post-injection validation via static analysis and LLM-based discriminators. This modular decomposition allows specialized agents to focus on distinct tasks, improving robustness of injection and reducing error propagation across the workflow. Evaluations across three distinct benchmarks demonstrate that AVIATOR achieves 91%-95% injection success rates, significantly surpassing existing automated dataset generation techniques in both accuracy and scope of software vulnerabilities."}

We propose Amortized Latent Steering (ALS), which collapses this iterative optimization into a single offline-computed vector applied at constant cost during inference. ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from successful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to calibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from the success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it.

Twins reproduced individual responses with 75% accuracy and seemingly low correlation with human answers (approximately 0.2).

To address these challenges, we introduce the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), the first large-scale self-supervised MAE framework pretrained exclusively on ultrasound data. The model was pre-trained on 370,000 2D and 3D ultrasound images curated from 46 open-source datasets, collectively termed OpenUS-46, spanning over twenty anatomical regions.

Current paradigms either myopically optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators, creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \\textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \\textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense, turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy, decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action, state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially, \\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations, our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts, proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible, real-world impact.

Although AI survey chatbots improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality. We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.076 mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving assessment systems."}

Recent studies suggest that incorporating sentiment information from both news content and user comments can enhance detection performance. However, existing approaches typically treat sentiment features as auxiliary signals, overlooking role differentiation, that is, the same sentiment polarity may originate from users with distinct roles, thereby limiting their ability to capture nuanced patterns for effective detection. To address this issue, we propose SARC, a Sentiment-Augmented Role Clustering framework which utilizes sentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles for improved fake news detection. The framework first generates user features through joint comment text representation (with BiGRU and Attention mechanism) and sentiment encoding. It then constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to automatically categorize user roles. Finally, unlike existing approaches which take fake news label as the unique supervision signal, we propose a joint optimization objective integrating role clustering and fake news detection to further improve the model performance.

Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first \"think\" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior."}

A natural strategy to increase the likelihood of retrieving relevant information is to expand the number of retrieved documents. However, involving more documents could introduce significant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby reducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does not require any model fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks.

Current training sample influence estimation methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work, we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR) that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect. Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior knowledge in the field."}

Following this line of reasoning, we introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2% performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence conditions in medical imaging."}

The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has demonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts, those with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently, fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces, introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals. Empirical results on the Qwen2.5 series demonstrate that ERPO consistently surpasses strong baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks."}

While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory relies on a general definition of \"B-calibration,\" which is a notion of calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why semantic calibration emerges in LLMs."}

This capability raises safety concerns as it may, for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent representations across tasks.

To establish a challenging and reliable evaluation set, we constructed 600 query-page-answer triples.

The queries span six major public domains and are systematically categorized by the reasoning modality required: text-based, visual-based (e.g., chart interpretation), and cross-modal. We evaluate SDS KoPub VDR on two complementary tasks that reflect distinct retrieval paradigms: (1) text-only retrieval, which measures a model's ability to locate relevant document pages based solely on textual signals, and (2) multimodal retrieval, which assesses retrieval performance when visual features (e.g., tables, charts, and layouts) are jointly leveraged alongside text. This dual-task evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly in multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art models.

We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything. Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks, BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700 question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens) documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits increase with document length.

However, prior efforts suffer from limited data coverage, as recommendation datasets primarily harvest candidates from public portals and omit many datasets actually used in published papers, and from an overreliance on content similarity that biases model toward superficial similarity and overlooks experimental suitability.

To investigate this, we introduce the Moral RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful'' and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned models performing particularly poorly.

In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE (PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs' capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn, interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300 realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to 84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions.

In contrast, we focus on the commonalities among LMs, which can deepen our understanding of LMs and even facilitate cross-model knowledge transfer. In this work, we introduce the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from the order-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout and reveal that the OLA at the same order across LMs exhibits significant similarities. Furthermore, we discover an implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge. Based on these two findings, we propose the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA), a training-free cross-LM adapter transfer method.

This report empirically assesses the performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral 24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46), while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability, discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary domain-adaptation issue for simplification."}

In this short paper, taking math as an example domain, we study the performance of different LLMs across languages. Experimental results show that there exists a non-negligible and consistent gap in the performance of the models across languages. Interestingly, and somewhat against expectations, the gap exists for both high- and low-resource languages. We hope that these results influence further research into cross-lingual capability generalization for next generation LLMs. If it weren't for the fact that they are false!

We conduct white-box KD experiments using LLMs from the Qwen and Llama2 families, employing CoT data from the CoT-Collection dataset. The distilled models are then evaluated on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from the BIG-Bench-Hard (BBH) benchmark, which presents complex challenges for smaller LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the role of CoT in improving white-box KD effectiveness, enabling the distilled models to achieve better average performance in natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from BBH."}

Existing approaches predominantly rely on context injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs. Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios."}

Their typically unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models, typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing podcast narratives at scale.To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a more robust framework for studying influence in digital media."}

We use two different approaches for retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression approach further focused on \"sparing\" and its normalization (insertion of spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description. The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and 99.5% when combined. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5% for the baseline.

To address this limitation, we present BengaliBPE, a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer specifically developed for the Bengali script. BengaliBPE applies Unicode normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules to maintain linguistic consistency and preserve subword integrity. We use a large-scale Bengali news classification dataset to compare BengaliBPE with three baselines: Whitespace, SentencePiece BPE, and HuggingFace BPE. The evaluation considers tokenization granularity, encoding speed, and downstream classification accuracy. While all methods perform reasonably well, BengaliBPE provides the most detailed segmentation and the best morphological interpretability, albeit with slightly higher computational cost.

Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer network principles introduced by Kivela et al.

Our experimental design extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants' proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?"}

To better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this direction to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities. We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an \"evil\" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that never manifest during training or evaluations."}

This paper examines the interplay between KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window (e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence. Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial \"gist\") can yield more coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and view \"cache health\" holistically beyond mere size."}

Providing comprehensive feedback on both verbal and non-verbal aspects of public speaking is time-intensive, making consistent and individualized assessment impractical. This study integrates research on verbal and non-verbal cues in public speaking to develop an AI-driven assessment model for engineering students. Our approach combines speech analysis, computer vision, and sentiment detection into a multi-modal AI system that provides assessment and feedback. The model evaluates (1) verbal communication (pitch, loudness, pacing, intonation), (2) non-verbal communication (facial expressions, gestures, posture), and (3) expressive coherence, a novel integration ensuring alignment between speech and body language. Unlike previous systems that assess these aspects separately, our model fuses multiple modalities to deliver personalized, scalable feedback. Preliminary testing demonstrated that our AI-generated feedback was moderately aligned with expert evaluations. Among the state-of-the-art AI models evaluated, all of which were Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini and OpenAI models, Gemini Pro emerged as the best-performing, showing the strongest agreement with human annotators. By eliminating reliance on human evaluators, this AI-driven public speaking trainer enables repeated practice, helping students naturally align their speech with body language and emotion, crucial for impactful and professional communication."}

We resolve a main open question in this line, proving a tight bound of $1/2$ on the best achievable lower density. We then strengthen the model to allow \\emph{partial enumeration}, where the adversary reveals only an infinite subset $C \\subseteq K$. We show that generation in the limit remains achievable, and if $C$ has lower density $\\alpha$ in $K$, the algorithm's output achieves density at least $\\alpha/2$, matching the upper bound. This generalizes the $1/2$ bound to the partial-information setting, where the generator must recover within a factor $1/2$ of the revealed subset's density. We further revisit the classical Gold--Angluin model of \\emph{language identification} under partial enumeration. We characterize when identification in the limit is possible -- when hypotheses $M_t$ eventually satisfy $C \\subseteq M \\subseteq K$ -- and in the process give a new topological formulation of Angluin's characterization, showing that her condition is precisely equivalent to an appropriate topological space having the $T_D$ separation property."}

As the significance of narratives for understanding current societal issues such as polarization and misinformation becomes increasingly evident, there is a growing demand for methods that support their empirical analysis. To this end, we propose a graph-based formalism and machine-guided method for extracting, representing, and analyzing selected narrative signals from digital textual corpora, based on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). The formalism and method introduced here specifically cater to the study of political narratives that figure in texts from digital media such as archived political speeches, social media posts, transcripts of parliamentary debates, and political manifestos on party websites. We approach the study of such political narratives as a problem of information retrieval: starting from a textual corpus, we first extract a graph-like representation of the meaning of each sentence in the corpus using AMR. Drawing on transferable concepts from narratology, we then apply a set of heuristics to filter these graphs for representations of 1) actors and their relationships, 2) the events in which these actors figure, and 3) traces of the perspectivization of these events. We approach these references to actors, events, and instances of perspectivization as core narrative signals that allude to larger political narratives. By systematically analyzing and re-assembling these signals into networks that guide the researcher to the relevant parts of the text, the underlying narratives can be reconstructed through a combination of distant and close reading. A case study of State of the European Union addresses (2010 -- 2023) demonstrates how the formalism can be used to inductively surface signals of political narratives from public discourse."}

We explored how model characteristics (size, multimodal capabilities, architectural generation) influence grounding performance, distributional factor dependencies (word frequency, embeddings, feature distances), and human-model processing differences. We evaluated 21 models from four families (GPT, Gemini, LLaMA, Qwen) using 3,611 words from the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms through correlation, distance metrics, and qualitative analysis. Results showed that larger (6 out of 8 comparisons), multimodal (5 of 7), and newer models (5 of 8) generally outperformed their smaller, text-based, and older counterparts. Top models achieved 85-90% accuracy and 0.58-0.65 correlations with human ratings, demonstrating substantial similarity. Moreover, distributional factors showed minimal impact, not exceeding human dependency levels. However, despite strong alignment, models were not identical to humans, as even top performers showed differences in distance and correlation measures, with qualitative analysis revealing processing patterns related to absent sensory grounding. Additionally, it remains questionable whether introducing multimodality resolves this grounding deficit. Although multimodality improved performance, it seems to provide similar information as massive text rather than qualitatively different data, as benefits occurred across unrelated sensory dimensions and massive text-only models achieved comparable results.

It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Extensive experiments across four models and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that CoQ achieves substantial accuracy improvements and significantly lowers invalid SQL rates compared to prior generic LLM-based, SQL-aided, and hybrid baselines, confirming its superior effectiveness in table understanding.

However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation (DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors."}

Many machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications, including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights."}

While the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs. This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to prompt changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of LLMs."}

Existing detection approaches, such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time, unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g., pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility), allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments."}

However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8$\\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference latency and memory load.

A self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively.

Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and imperceptibility under the practical setting. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve the attack transferability and imperceptibility.

Previous methods typically address this by maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of \\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy RL, sustaining continuous scaling across $3,000$ training steps and $81,204$ GPU-hours, where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.

In this work, we study how agents do human work by presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering, computation, writing, and design.

Using such induced workflows, we compare how humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the UI-centric methods typically used by humans.

This work introduces a novel knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection.

To avoid the prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++ optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones ($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals, $\\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer $\\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \\textit{Condition Preference Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\\%$ error rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\\%$ in human pose, and consistent $2$--$5\\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps."}

DARN integrates three key innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and (3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation.

However, two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation. Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer.

With a reported 27% misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively, marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases."}

Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions inherent in the built environment.

To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a 17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers, while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively."}

In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide path selection.

Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.

In this paper, we describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining, and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation. Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality."}

Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.) from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation network, by removing static objects including background components. To further boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.

However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes.

However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift. The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies), we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously. To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features. The code is available atthis https URL."}

The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously.

Automated segmentation could enhance precision and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference (RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718).

This paper presents MPRF, a multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation.

This field has witnessed numerous advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However, existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead. Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time. Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks.

To address this, we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing event-based information. We develop five classification models using both traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed, achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms.

In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).

Additionally, we construct datasets specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV, filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU.

Most existing methods rely on a single model to perform feature fusion and similarity matching. However, this paradigm faces two major challenges. First, one model alone can't see the whole picture and the tiny details at the same time; it has to handle different tasks with the same weights, so it often misses the small but important links between image and text. Second, the absence of dynamic weight allocation prevents adaptive leveraging of complementary model strengths, so the resulting embedding drifts away from the target and misleads the nearest-neighbor search in CIR. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) for multi-model collaboration in CIR. Rather than optimizing a single method in isolation, DAFM exploits the complementary strengths of heterogeneous models and adaptively rebalances their contributions. This not only maximizes retrieval accuracy but also ensures that the performance gains are independent of the fusion order, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Experiments on the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements. Our method achieves a Recall@10 of 93.21 and an Rmean of 84.43 on CIRR, and an average Rmean of 67.48 on FashionIQ, surpassing recent strong baselines by up to 4.5%.

Our analysis specifically addresses black-box evasion attacks, highlighting transfer-based attacks due to their practical significance and typically high transferability between neural network models. We underline the computational infeasibility of exhaustively exploring high-dimensional input spaces to achieve complete test coverage.

Models such as CLIP are currently widely used to bridge cross-modal representations, and text-to-image diffusion models are arguably the leading models in terms of realistic image generation. Image generative models are trained on massive datasets that provide them with powerful internal spatial representations. In this work, we explore the potential benefits of such representations, beyond image generation, in particular, for dense visual prediction tasks. We focus on the task of image segmentation, which is traditionally solved by training models on closed-vocabulary datasets, with pixel-level annotations. To avoid the annotation cost or training large diffusion models, we constraint our setup to be zero-shot and training-free. In a nutshell, our pipeline leverages different and relatively small-sized, open-source foundation models for zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. The pipeline is as follows: the image is passed to both a captioner model (i.e. BLIP) and a diffusion model (i.e., Stable Diffusion Model) to generate a text description and visual representation, respectively. The features are clustered and binarized to obtain class agnostic masks for each object. These masks are then mapped to a textual class, using the CLIP model to support open-vocabulary. Finally, we add a refinement step that allows to obtain a more precise segmentation mask. Our approach (dubbed FreeSeg-Diff), which does not rely on any training, outperforms many training-based approaches on both Pascal VOC and COCO datasets. In addition, we show very competitive results compared to the recent weakly-supervised segmentation approaches. We provide comprehensive experiments showing the superiority of diffusion model features compared to other pretrained models. Project page:this https URL"}

We introduce Grendel, a distributed system designed to partition 3DGS parameters and parallelize computation across multiple GPUs. As each Gaussian affects a small, dynamic subset of rendered pixels, Grendel employs sparse all-to-all communication to transfer the necessary Gaussians to pixel partitions and performs dynamic load balancing. Unlike existing 3DGS systems that train using one camera view image at a time, Grendel supports batched training with multiple views. We explore various optimization hyperparameter scaling strategies and find that a simple sqrt(batch size) scaling rule is highly effective. Evaluations using large-scale, high-resolution scenes show that Grendel enhances rendering quality by scaling up 3DGS parameters across multiple GPUs. On the Rubble dataset, we achieve a test PSNR of 27.28 by distributing 40.4 million Gaussians across 16 GPUs, compared to a PSNR of 26.28 using 11.2 million Gaussians on a single GPU.

This method can produce both global and local features that focus on discriminative landmarks to recognize places for two-stage VPR by a parameter-efficient adaptation approach. Although SelaVPR has achieved competitive results, we argue that the previous adaptation is inefficient in training time and GPU memory usage, and the re-ranking paradigm is also costly in retrieval latency and storage usage. In pursuit of higher efficiency and better performance, we propose an extension of the SelaVPR, called SelaVPR++. Concretely, we first design a parameter-, time-, and memory-efficient adaptation method that uses lightweight multi-scale convolution (MultiConv) adapters to refine intermediate features from the frozen foundation backbone. This adaptation method does not back-propagate gradients through the backbone during training, and the MultiConv adapter facilitates feature interactions along the spatial axes and introduces proper local priors, thus achieving higher efficiency and better performance. Moreover, we propose an innovative re-ranking paradigm for more efficient VPR. Instead of relying on local features for re-ranking, which incurs huge overhead in latency and storage, we employ compact binary features for initial retrieval and robust floating-point (global) features for re-ranking.

To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images.

It regulates the learning pace on unlabeled data using two signals: a temporally averaged signal from an in-group teacher and a cross-architectural signal from a student in a second, distinct model group. Specifically, a novel consensus label generator (CLG) creates the pseudo-labels from the agreement between these two signals, establishing an effective learning curriculum.

Our analysis reveals that linear CFG improves generation quality via three distinct components: (i) a mean-shift term that approximately steers samples in the direction of class means, (ii) a positive Contrastive Principal Components (CPC) term that amplifies class-specific features, and (iii) a negative CPC term that suppresses generic features prevalent in unconditional data. We then verify that these insights in real-world, nonlinear diffusion models: over a broad range of noise levels, linear CFG resembles the behavior of its nonlinear counterpart.

A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion, then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models, which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the parameter-efficient adaptation of binary-quantized generative models for image editing, and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose EditInfinity, which adapts \\emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our EditInfinity to perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark across `add', `change', and `delete' editing operations, demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines.

This has motivated collaborative training across institutions via federated learning (FL)-a privacy-preserving framework that aggregates model updates instead of sharing raw data. Conventional FL requires architectural homogeneity, restricting sites from using models tailored to their resources or needs. To address this limitation, we propose FedGAT, a model-agnostic FL technique that first collaboratively trains a global generative prior for MR images, adapted from a natural image foundation model composed of a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a transformer that generates images via spatial-scale autoregression. We fine-tune the transformer module after injecting it with a lightweight site-specific prompting mechanism, keeping the VAE frozen, to efficiently adapt the model to multi-site MRI data. In a second tier, each site independently trains its preferred reconstruction model by augmenting local data with synthetic MRI data from other sites, generated by site-prompting the tuned prior. This decentralized augmentation improves generalization while preserving privacy. Experiments on multi-institutional datasets show that FedGAT outperforms state-of-the-art FL baselines in both within- and cross-site reconstruction performance under model-heterogeneous settings."}

This paper examines the interplay between KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window (e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence. Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial \"gist\") can yield more coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and view \"cache health\" holistically beyond mere size."}

We focus on data-scarce regimes where the number of training samples falls below the critical threshold, making grokking unobservable, and on practical scenarios involving distribution shift. We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and accelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available data lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for deployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We then study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that while standard supervised training fails when either distribution has insufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual distributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual pretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find that KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting, achieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data. Together, our results provide new insights into the mechanics of grokking under knowledge transfer and underscore the central role of KD in enabling generalization in low-data and evolving distribution settings."}

We present DuetServe, a unified LLM serving framework that achieves disaggregation-level isolation within a single GPU. DuetServe operates in aggregated mode by default and dynamically activates SM-level GPU spatial multiplexing when TBT degradation is predicted. Its key idea is to decouple prefill and decode execution only when needed through fine-grained, adaptive SM partitioning that provides phase isolation only when contention threatens latency service level objectives (SLOs). DuetServe integrates (1) an attention-aware roofline model to forecast iteration latency, (2) a partitioning optimizer that selects the optimal SM split to maximize throughput under TBT constraints, and (3) an interruption-free execution engine that eliminates CPU-GPU synchronization overhead.

Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions, SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy. On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry.

To address these issues, we propose two distinct and complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format. Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks, including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle, demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based agents.

This study aims to understand whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives. Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates the robustness of this property.

Our empirical analysis reveals critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in determining success.

In the online setting, [NR23] proposed an inefficient algorithm that achieves $\\sqrt T$ $\\ell_2$-multicalibration error for a hypothesis class of group membership functions and an elicitable property $\\Gamma$, after $T$ rounds of interaction between a forecaster and adversary.In this paper, we generalize multicalibration for an elicitable property $\\Gamma$ from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis classes and introduce a stronger notion -- swap multicalibration, following [GKR23]. Subsequently, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm which, when given access to an online agnostic learner, achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$ $\\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability (for $r\\ge2$) for a hypothesis class with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and an elicitable property $\\Gamma$. For the special case of $r=2$, this implies an oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $T^{1/3}$ $\\ell_2$-swap multicalibration error, which significantly improves on the previously established bounds for the problem [NR23, GMS25, LSS25a], and completely resolves an open question raised in [GJRR24] on the possibility of an oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $\\sqrt{T}$ $\\ell_2$-mean multicalibration error by answering it in a strongly affirmative sense."}

This predict-then-optimize paradigm has motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer, often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c) as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity, and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training time.

Specifically, while evaluations of these `unlearned' models under deterministic (greedy) decoding often suggest successful knowledge removal using standard benchmarks (as has been done in the literature), we show that sensitive information reliably resurfaces when models are sampled with standard probabilistic decoding. To rigorously capture this vulnerability, we introduce \\texttt{leak@$k$}, a new meta-evaluation metric that quantifies the likelihood of forgotten knowledge reappearing when generating $k$ samples from the model under realistic decoding strategies. Using three widely adopted benchmarks, TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP, we conduct the first large-scale, systematic study of unlearning reliability using our newly defined \\texttt{leak@$k$} metric.

Recent studies have established global convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence in noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the theoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with its trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and regression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural properties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the trajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by establishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high SNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The trajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM estimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle between the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our analysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating EM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level.

To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by 70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without decomposition from the same baseline study.

Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific medications and comorbidities.

MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and $34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and computational cost, specifically achieving about $\\boldsymbol{\\times14.5}$ faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining good performance.

We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure, preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1% (PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions.

We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise.

This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate statistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated outputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove its theoretical feasibility and stealthiness.

This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

This study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns. Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range = 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment.

For decades, operationalizing this step for complex, non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework, a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity, individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries.

Deep reinforcement learning offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel, optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm. Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales (N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods.

Although these approaches result in impressive reductions in compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically in-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute tradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications require more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency and memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that artificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent state update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at specific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design process, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress & Attend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two simple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of tokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression results in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and memory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for efficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once, unlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without any retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive evaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and long-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing efficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different compute-memory budgets. Further, a single CAT matches dense transformer in language modeling across model scales while being 1.4-3x faster and requiring 2-9x lower total memory usage."}

However, existing models are typically trained for a single material type and fail to generalize across distinct constitutive behaviors, limiting their applicability in real-world engineering settings. Using granular flows as a running example, we propose a parameter-efficient conditioning mechanism that makes the GNS model adaptive to material parameters. We identify that sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the early message-passing (MP) layers, a finding we link to the local nature of constitutive models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) and their effects on information propagation. We empirically validate this by showing that fine-tuning only the first few (1-5) of 10 MP layers of a pretrained model achieves comparable test performance as compared to fine-tuning the entire network. Building on this insight, we propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) conditioning mechanism designed to specifically target these early layers. This approach produces accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or moderately extrapolated values (e.g., up to 2.5 degrees for friction angle and 0.25 kPa for cohesion) when trained exclusively on as few as 12 short simulation trajectories from new materials, representing a 5-fold data reduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method.

Critical to our method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an important role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench, show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across state-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemini.

Soft prompts, as carefully crafted modules that efficiently adapt vision-language models to specific tasks, necessitate effective copyright protection. In this paper, we investigate model copyright protection by auditing whether suspicious third-party models incorporate protected soft prompts. While this can be viewed as a special case of model ownership auditing, our analysis shows that existing techniques are ineffective due to prompt learning's unique characteristics. Non-intrusive auditing is inherently prone to false positives when independent models share similar data distributions with victim models. Intrusive approaches also fail: backdoor methods designed for CLIP cannot embed functional triggers, while extending traditional DNN backdoor techniques to prompt learning suffers from harmfulness and ambiguity challenges. We find that these failures in intrusive auditing stem from the same fundamental reason: watermarking operates within the same decision space as the primary task yet pursues opposing objectives. Motivated by these findings, we propose sequential watermarking for soft prompts (SWAP), which implants watermarks into a different and more complex space. SWAP encodes watermarks through a specific order of defender-specified out-of-distribution classes, inspired by the zero-shot prediction capability of CLIP. This watermark, which is embedded in a more complex space, keeps the original prediction label unchanged, making it less opposed to the primary task. We further design a hypothesis-test-guided verification protocol for SWAP and provide theoretical analyses of success conditions.

Current training sample influence estimation methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work, we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR) that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect. Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior knowledge in the field."}

To avoid the prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++ optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones ($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals, $\\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer $\\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \\textit{Condition Preference Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\\%$ error rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\\%$ in human pose, and consistent $2$--$5\\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps."}

We present a machine learning approach to extract $\\tau$ from simulated kSZ maps. We train advanced machine learning models, including swin transformers, on high-resolution seminumeric simulations of the kSZ signal. To robustly quantify prediction uncertainties of $\\tau$, we employ the Laplace Approximation (LA).

However, two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation. Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering.

While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory relies on a general definition of \"B-calibration,\" which is a notion of calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration.

Cognitive screening tools are disruptive, time-consuming, and only capture brief snapshots of activity. Wearable sensors offer an attractive alternative by continuously monitoring physiological signals. This study investigated whether physiological data can accurately predict scores on established cognitive tests. Research Design and Methods: We recorded physiological signals from 23 older adults completing three NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery tests, which assess working memory, processing speed, and attention. The Empatica EmbracePlus, a wearable device, measured blood volume pulse, skin conductance, temperature, and movement. Statistical features were extracted using wavelet-based and segmentation methods. We then applied supervised learning and validated predictions via cross-validation, hold-out testing, and bootstrapping. Results: Our models showed strong performance with Spearman's \\rho of 0.73-0.82 and mean absolute errors of 0.14-0.16, significantly outperforming a naive mean predictor. Sensor roles varied: heart-related signals combined with movement and temperature best predicted working memory, movement paired with skin conductance was most informative for processing speed, and heart in tandem with skin conductance worked best for attention. Discussion and Implications: These findings suggest that wearable sensors paired with AI tools such as supervised learning and feature engineering can noninvasively track specific cognitive functions in older adults, enabling continuous monitoring.

While previous studies have mainly focused on segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of 0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups. These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis, and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches."}

To detect network intrusions in a real-time, precision and low-false positives setup, the framework utilizes the application of advanced machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and CNN-BiLSTM. SmartSecChain-SDN is based on the Hyperledger Fabric, which is a permissioned blockchain technology, to provide secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving storage and, thus, guarantee that the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) records cannot be altered and can be analyzed comprehensively. The system also has Quality of Service (QoS) rules and traffic shaping based on applications, which enables prioritization of critical services, such as VoIP, video conferencing, and business applications, as well as de-prioritization of non-essential traffic, such as downloads and updates. Mininet can simulate real-time SDN scenarios because it is used to prototype whole architectures. It is also compatible with controllers OpenDaylight and Ryu. It has tested the framework using the InSDN dataset and proved that it can identify different kinds of cyberattacks and handle bandwidth allocation efficiently under circumstances of resource constraints.

Prior work showed that generation is always possible, and that some algorithms achieve positive lower density, revealing a \\emph{validity--breadth} trade-off between correctness and coverage. We resolve a main open question in this line, proving a tight bound of $1/2$ on the best achievable lower density. We then strengthen the model to allow \\emph{partial enumeration}, where the adversary reveals only an infinite subset $C \\subseteq K$. We show that generation in the limit remains achievable, and if $C$ has lower density $\\alpha$ in $K$, the algorithm's output achieves density at least $\\alpha/2$, matching the upper bound. This generalizes the $1/2$ bound to the partial-information setting, where the generator must recover within a factor $1/2$ of the revealed subset's density. We further revisit the classical Gold--Angluin model of \\emph{language identification} under partial enumeration. We characterize when identification in the limit is possible -- when hypotheses $M_t$ eventually satisfy $C \\subseteq M \\subseteq K$ -- and in the process give a new topological formulation of Angluin's characterization, showing that her condition is precisely equivalent to an appropriate topological space having the $T_D$ separation property."}

To better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this direction to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities. We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an \"evil\" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that never manifest during training or evaluations."}

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH.

To this end, we first propose an algorithm called Mild-OGD for the full-information case, where delayed gradients are available. The basic idea is to maintain multiple experts in parallel, each performing a gradient descent step with different learning rates for every delayed gradient according to their arrival order, and utilize a meta-algorithm to track the best one based on their delayed performance. Despite the simplicity of this idea, our novel analysis shows that the dynamic regret of Mild-OGD can be automatically bounded by $O(\\sqrt{\\bar{d}T(P_T+1)})$ under the in-order assumption and $O(\\sqrt{dT(P_T+1)})$ in the worst case, where $\\bar{d}$ and $d$ denote the average and maximum delay respectively, $T$ is the time horizon, and $P_T$ is the path-length of comparators.

With the rapid progress of deep tabular prediction methods, especially pretrained (foundation) models, there is a growing need to evaluate these methods systematically and to understand their behavior. We present an extensive study on TALENT, a collection of 300+ datasets spanning broad ranges of size, feature composition (numerical/categorical mixes), domains, and output types (binary, multi--class, regression). Our evaluation shows that ensembling benefits both tree-based and neural approaches. Traditional gradient-boosted trees remain very strong baselines, yet recent pretrained tabular models now match or surpass them on many tasks, narrowing--but not eliminating--the historical advantage of tree ensembles. Despite architectural diversity, top performance concentrates within a small subset of models, providing practical guidance for method selection. To explain these outcomes, we quantify dataset heterogeneity by learning from meta-features and early training dynamics to predict later validation behavior. This dynamics-aware analysis indicates that heterogeneity--such as the interplay of categorical and numerical attributes--largely determines which family of methods is favored. Finally, we introduce a two-level design beyond the 300 common-size datasets: a compact TALENT-tiny core (45 datasets) for rapid, reproducible evaluation, and a TALENT-extension suite targeting high-dimensional, many-class, and very large-scale settings for stress testing. In summary, these results offer actionable insights into the strengths, limitations, and future directions for improving deep tabular learning."}

As the trained model is used, data generation causes the model to evolve, leading to deviations from the original data distribution. The impact of such model-induced distribution shifts in federated learning is increasingly likely to transpire in real-life use cases. A recently proposed approach extends performative prediction to federated learning with the resulting model converging to a performative stable point, which may be far from the performative optimal point. Earlier research in centralized settings has shown that the performative optimal point can be achieved under model-induced distribution shifts, but these approaches require the performative risk to be convex and the training data to be noiseless, assumptions often violated in realistic federated learning systems. This paper overcomes all of these shortcomings and proposes Performative Robust Optimal Federated Learning, an algorithm that finds performative optimal points in federated learning from noisy and contaminated data. We present the convergence analysis under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which applies to non-convex objectives. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the advantage of Robust Optimal Federated Learning over the state-of-the-art."}

Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task.

Traditionally, these models are handcrafted, which requires significant domain knowledge, coding expertise, and time investment.

In particular, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for in-context pattern recognition, leveraging knowledge from diverse domains to solve complex problems, and generating executable code that can be used to facilitate the generation of cognitive models. Building on this potential, we introduce a pipeline for Guided generation of Computational Cognitive Models (GeCCo). Given task instructions, participant data, and a template function, GeCCo prompts an LLM to propose candidate models, fits proposals to held-out data, and iteratively refines them based on feedback constructed from their predictive performance. We benchmark this approach across four different cognitive domains -- decision making, learning, planning, and memory -- using three open-source LLMs, spanning different model sizes, capacities, and families. On four human behavioral data sets, the LLM generated models that consistently matched or outperformed the best domain-specific models from the cognitive science literature.

Such outputs only capture aleatoric uncertainty. To capture epistemic uncertainty, approximate Gaussian inference methods have been proposed. We develop a common formalism to describe such methods, which we view as outputting Gaussian distributions over the logit space. Predictives are then obtained as the expectations of the Gaussian distributions pushed forward through the softmax. However, such softmax Gaussian integrals cannot be solved analytically, and Monte Carlo (MC) approximations can be costly and noisy. We propose to replace the softmax activation by element-wise normCDF or sigmoid, which allows for the accurate sampling-free approximation of predictives. This also enables the approximation of the Gaussian pushforwards by Dirichlet distributions with moment matching. This approach entirely eliminates the runtime and memory overhead associated with MC sampling.

As such, developing tsGMs has become a prominent research focus within the time series forecasting community. However, the benefits of tsGMs may not always be realised if the given set of time series is heterogeneous.

Additionally, the definition of homogeneity remains ambiguous in the literature. To address these challenges, this paper explores how to define data heterogeneity and proposes a two-stage modelling framework: At stage one, a tsGM is learnt to identify homogeneous patterns; and at stage two, tsLMs (e.g., ARIMA) or sub-tsGMs tailored to different groups are learnt to capture the heterogeneity.

Hence, current optimization methods force a choice between domain knowledge and reliability, with no principled approach that affords both. In this work, we show that training language models through the uncertainty-aware objectives of traditional optimization methods enables their use as reliable optimizers guided by natural language. By teaching LLMs from experimental outcomes under uncertainty, we transform their overconfidence from a fundamental limitation into a precise calibration mechanism.

In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification.

On the DW-4, LJ-13, and alanine-dipeptide benchmarks, VT-DIS achieves effective sample sizes of approximately 80 %, 35 %, and 3.5 %, respectively, while using only a fraction of the computational budget required by vanilla diffusion + IS or PF-ODE-based IS."}

The problem becomes even more difficult when model performance must be maintained under adherence to strict resource constraints. Existing solutions often depend on drift-detection methods that produce high computational overhead for resource-constrained environments, and fail to provide strict guarantees on resource usage or theoretical performance assurances. To address these shortcomings, we propose RCCDA: a dynamic model update policy that optimizes ML training dynamics while ensuring compliance to predefined resource constraints, utilizing only past loss information and a tunable drift threshold. In developing our policy, we analytically characterize the evolution of model loss under concept drift with arbitrary training update decisions. Integrating these results into a Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework produces a lightweight greedy-optimal policy that provably limits update frequency and cost. Experimental results on four domain generalization datasets demonstrate that our policy outperforms baseline methods in inference accuracy while adhering to strict resource constraints under several schedules of concept drift, making our solution uniquely suited for real-time ML deployments."}

Current research predominantly focuses on two concepts of group fairness within FL: Global Fairness (overall model disparity across all clients) and Local Fairness (the disparity within each client). However, the non-decomposable, non-differentiable nature of fairness criteria poses two fundamental, unresolved challenges for fair FL: (i) Harmonizing global and local fairness, especially in multi-class setting; (ii) Enabling a controllable, optimal accuracy-fairness trade-off. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel controllable federated group-fairness calibration framework, named FedFACT. FedFACT identifies the Bayes-optimal classifiers under both global and local fairness constraints, yielding models with minimal performance decline while guaranteeing fairness. Building on the characterization of the optimal fair classifiers, we reformulate fair federated learning as a personalized cost-sensitive learning problem for in-processing and a bi-level optimization for post-processing. Theoretically, we provide convergence and generalization guarantees for FedFACT to approach the near-optimal accuracy under given fairness levels. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets across various data heterogeneity demonstrate that FedFACT consistently outperforms baselines in balancing accuracy and global-local fairness."}

However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8$\\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference latency and memory load.

We introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. By analyzing the distinct dynamics induced by this modification, we reveal a unique property we coin as auto-compression, the ability of a network to organically compress information during training with gradient descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression, information is dynamically \"pushed\" into early layers during training, enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise training patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to 18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT architectures.

A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems, Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically lower energy function evaluations.

LGES modifies the greedy step; rather than always applying the highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted search yields up to a \\(10\\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using prior knowledge, and can correct this knowledge when contradicted by data.

In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM proba- bilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability."}

Both models treat structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. They are pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX models across 11 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. LimiX-16M consistently surpasses strong baselines, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. Notably, LimiX-2M delivers strong results under tight compute and memory budgets.

Robust and precise fatigue life predictors are thus essential to ensure safety. Traditional engineering methods, while reliable, are time consuming and involve complex workflows, including steps such as conducting several Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, deriving the expected loading spectrum, and applying cycle counting techniques like peak-valley or rainflow counting. These steps often require collaboration between multiple teams and tools, added to the computational time and effort required to achieve fatigue life predictions. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising complement to traditional fatigue life estimation methods, enabling faster iterations and generalization, providing quick estimates that guide decisions alongside conventional simulations.In this paper, we present a ML-based pipeline that aims to estimate the fatigue life of different aircraft wing locations given the flight parameters of the different missions that the aircraft will be operating throughout its operational life.

We propose Amortized Latent Steering (ALS), which collapses this iterative optimization into a single offline-computed vector applied at constant cost during inference. ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from successful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to calibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from the success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it.

Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of social regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our WOFTRL recovers the good performances that social regret is constant in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies last-iterate converge to the Nash equilibrium in poly-matrix zero-sum games.

Previous methods typically address this by maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of \\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy RL, sustaining continuous scaling across $3,000$ training steps and $81,204$ GPU-hours, where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.

Considering that many robotic tasks - particularly those involving locomotion - require periodic behaviors across varying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is essential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a framework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key idea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space, thereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By capturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse periods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We further show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream tasks such as hurdling.

The core idea behind SCMs is to estimate treatment effects by predicting counterfactual outcomes for a treated unit using a weighted combination of observed outcomes from untreated units. The accuracy of these predictions is crucial for evaluating the treatment effect of a policy intervention. Subsequent research has therefore focused on estimating SC weights. In this study, we highlight a key endogeneity issue in existing SCMs-namely, the correlation between the outcomes of untreated units and the error term of the synthetic control, which leads to bias in both counterfactual outcome prediction and treatment effect estimation. To address this issue, we propose a novel SCM based on moment matching, assuming that the outcome distribution of the treated unit can be approximated by a weighted mixture of the distributions of untreated units. Under this assumption, we estimate SC weights by matching the moments of the treated outcomes with the weighted sum of the moments of the untreated outcomes. Our method offers three advantages: first, under the mixture model assumption, our estimator is asymptotically unbiased; second, this asymptotic unbiasedness reduces the mean squared error in counterfactual predictions; and third, our method provides full distributions of the treatment effect rather than just expected values, thereby broadening the applicability of SCMs. Finally, we present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

These workflows depend critically on the prompts used to provide the roles models play in such workflows. Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability. To address this important problem of inference-time prompt optimization, we introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time optimization method that uses an agentic loop of LLMs to generate and apply textual feedback. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to approach the performance of their larger counterparts. This highlights its potential for building more cost-effective and powerful hybrid AI systems, thereby democratizing access to high-performing AI."}

Traditional methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects. Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU). These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications."}

Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal variables."}

This paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast, when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system. Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver mobility."}

First, we introduce a closed-form estimator that reconstructs scaled beta distributions from limited statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, and median) via composite quantile and moment matching. The recovered parameters $(\\alpha,\\beta)$, when used as features in Random Forest classifiers, improve pairwise classification on time-series snapshots, validating the fidelity of the recovered distributions. Second, we establish a link between classification accuracy and distributional closeness by deriving error bounds that constrain total variation distance and Jensen-Shannon divergence, the latter exhibiting quadratic convergence. Third, we show that zero-variance features act as an implicit regularizer, increasing selection probability for mid-ranked predictors and producing deeper, more varied trees. A SeatGeek pricing dataset serves as the primary application, illustrating distributional recovery and event-level classification while situating these methods within the structure and dynamics of the secondary ticket marketplace. The UCI handwritten digits dataset confirms the broader regularization effect.

Failure of low-degree polynomials below the KS threshold was also proven when $K=o(\\sqrt{n})$.When $K\\geq \\sqrt{n}$, Chin et al.(2025) recently prove that, in a sparse regime, community recovery in polynomial time is possible below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths.

We show that this is not an inherent failure but an artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying representational geometry of the knowledge being modified."}

Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM).

We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual participants in real time.

These AI-powered systems function as autonomous teammates capable of planning and executing complex development tasks. Agents have become active participants in refactoring, a cornerstone of sustainable software development aimed at improving internal code quality without altering observable behavior. Despite their increasing adoption, there is a critical lack of empirical understanding regarding how agentic refactoring is utilized in practice, how it compares to human-driven refactoring, and what impact it has on code quality. To address this empirical gap, we present a large-scale study of AI agent-generated refactorings in real-world open-source Java projects, analyzing 15,451 refactoring instances across 12,256 pull requests and 14,988 commits derived from the AIDev dataset. Our empirical analysis shows that refactoring is a common and intentional activity in this development paradigm, with agents explicitly targeting refactoring in 26.1% of commits. Analysis of refactoring types reveals that agentic efforts are dominated by low-level, consistency-oriented edits, such as Change Variable Type (11.8%), Rename Parameter (10.4%), and Rename Variable (8.5%), reflecting a preference for localized improvements over the high-level design changes common in human refactoring. Additionally, the motivations behind agentic refactoring focus overwhelmingly on internal quality concerns, with maintainability (52.5%) and readability (28.1%). Furthermore, quantitative evaluation of code quality metrics shows that agentic refactoring yields small but statistically significant improvements in structural metrics, particularly for medium-level changes, reducing class size and complexity (e.g., Class LOC median $\\Delta$ = -15.25)."}

Still, restricted access to proprietary model architectures hinders their adaption to specific tasks like SDV code generation. In this study, we propose using prompts, a common and basic strategy to interact with LLMs and redirect their responses. Using only system prompts with an appropriate and efficient prompt structure designed using advanced prompt engineering techniques, LLMs can be crafted without requiring a training session or access to their base design. This research investigates the extensive experiments on different models by applying various prompting techniques, including bare models, using a benchmark specifically created to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating SDV code.

A Study on the Responsiveness of NPM Package Maintainers", "abstract": "Background: Widespread use of third-party libraries makes ecosystems like Node Package Manager (npm) critical to modern software development. However, this interconnected chain of dependencies also creates challenges: bugs in one library can propagate downstream, potentially impacting many other libraries that rely on it. We hypothesize that maintainers may not always decide to fix a bug, especially if the maintainer decides it falls out of their responsibility within the chain of dependencies. Aims: To confirm this hypothesis, we investigate the responsiveness of 30,340 bug reports across 500 of the most depended-upon npm packages. Method: We adopt a mixed-method approach to mine repository issue data and perform qualitative open coding to analyze reasons behind unaddressed bug reports. Results: Our findings show that maintainers are generally responsive, with a median project-level responsiveness of 70% (IQR: 55%-89%), reflecting their commitment to support downstream developers. Conclusions: We present a taxonomy of the reasons some bugs remain unresolved. The taxonomy includes contribution practices, dependency constraints, and library-specific standards as reasons for not being responsive. Understanding maintainer behavior can inform practices that promote a more robust and responsive open-source ecosystem that benefits the entire community."}

They enable high-level architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation. Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation. This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability."}

For example, they may want to determine how the condition of an if-statement, a specific line in a configuration file, or the definition of a function changes. We call this the code mapping problem. Existing techniques, such as git diff, address this problem only insufficiently because they show all changes made to a file instead of focusing on a code region of the developer's choice. Other techniques focus on specific code elements and programming languages (e.g., methods in Java), limiting their applicability. This paper introduces CodeMapper, an approach to address the code mapping problem in a way that is independent of specific program elements and programming languages. Given a code region in one commit, CodeMapper finds the corresponding region in another commit. The approach consists of two phases: (i) computing candidate regions by analyzing diffs, detecting code movements, and searching for specific code fragments, and (ii) selecting the most likely target region by calculating similarities. Our evaluation applies CodeMapper to four datasets, including two new hand-annotated datasets containing code region pairs in ten popular programming languages. CodeMapper correctly identifies the expected target region in 71.0%--94.5% of all cases, improving over the best available baselines by 1.5--58.8 absolute percent points."}

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation."}

Current approaches for vulnerability analysis lack the commit-level granularity needed to track vulnerability introductions and fixes across forks, potentially leaving one-day vulnerabilities undetected. This paper presents a novel approach to help developers identify one-day vulnerabilities in forked repositories. Leveraging the global graph of public code, as captured by the Software Heritage archive, the approach propagates vulnerability information at the commit level and performs automated impact analysis. This enables automatic detection of forked projects that have not incorporated fixes, leaving them potentially vulnerable. Starting from 7162 repositories that, according to OSV, include vulnerable commits in their development histories, we identify 2.2 M forks, containing at least one vulnerable commit.

Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising merges.

In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness."}
