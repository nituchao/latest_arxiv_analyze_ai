Despite this advancement, current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured, individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and effective systems for teaching mathematics."}

In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle development."}

In each loop the RL player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or (ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames.

We argue that this profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI. Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general intelligence."}

Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is, how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during simulation-based testing and evaluation."}

Despite this growing threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation considerations for direct application by AI companies.

However, these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, \\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24. These findings suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical reasoning."}

This paper bridges this gap by developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), introducing the concept of \"action-taking situations\" to preserve PEC's flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's capabilities."}

Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge (Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and (2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering systems."}

Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness, corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term \"SMA-LLS\" (Simulating Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally salient contexts."}

The most common is the use of automated benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models. The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented, showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived quality of the responses that justifies their use."}

It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations."}

To address this challenge, quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on advancing healthcare technology."}

We therefore propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average 8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT, showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning.

Here, we explore the hypothesis that people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture'' (MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language; (ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines, under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating human reasoning in open-ended domains."}

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e., whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al., 2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps, layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants' ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans."}

This work focuses instead on the increasingly critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large, industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a) container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and (c) striped HDFS-FUSE.

However, in many papers neural networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error (MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations, neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads."}

In this paper, we propose local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most salient local features while minimizing computational overhead.

Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual information.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex, temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past, present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer. Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites.

Building on existing literature, we clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data. The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.

Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on domain-shared entities (\\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios. Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task. Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training. Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for further exploration.Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline methods."}

Especially, the new era has witnessed a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds. Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model (3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks."}

In this paper, we propose a DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image generation quality and model stability.

At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However, training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings. Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several benchmarks.

Most state-of-the-art (SOTA) KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent all the relations.

That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space.

The emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures. We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies, evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities."}

However, audio manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks, particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore, we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild, and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models.

To address this limitation, rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback (RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous, implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2 robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned reinforcement learning in interactive robotics."}

Traditional flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions (e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target, up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and 2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks."}

These low-rank matrices are commonly derived through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices."}

The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\\Omega(n^2)$ representation that explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the \\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic complexity with $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity. The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line, which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation optimization benchmarks.

However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available atthis https URL."}

Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy, employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process. First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model, which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner. Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its superiority and great potentials for video understanding."}

To fill this gap, we propose to incorporate graph-edge information into LLMs via prompt and attention innovations. We reformulate recommendations as a probabilistic generative problem using prompts. We develop a framework to incorporate graph edge information from the prompt and attention mechanisms for graph-structured LLM recommendations. We develop a new prompt design that brings in both first-order and second-order graph relationships; we devise an improved LLM attention mechanism to embed direct the spatial and connectivity information of edges.

To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a \"small but mighty\" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 23.4% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement, including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents."}

In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of four diverse bias types: position bias, verbosity bias, chain-of-thought bias, and bandwagon bias. We evaluate these biases across two widely adopted multi-agent LLM-as-Judge frameworks: Multi-Agent-Debate and LLM-as-Meta-Judge. Our results show that debate framework amplifies biases sharply after the initial debate, and this increased bias is sustained in subsequent rounds, while meta-judge approaches exhibit greater resistance.

The results reveal that this bias-free agent effectively reduces biases in debate settings but provides less benefit in meta-judge scenarios.

The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win rates (70%).

Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution, which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps. Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods."}

Without relying on extra data collection, our approach learns a recovery policy constructed by an inverse policy inferred from the object keypoint manifold gradient in the original training data. The recovery policy serves as a simple add-on to any base visuomotor BC policy, agnostic to a specific method, guiding the system back towards the training distribution to ensure task success even in OOD situations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our object-centric framework in both simulation and real robot experiments, achieving an improvement of 77.7\\% over the base policy in OOD.

In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\\approx40\\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases.

Despite this progress, domain semantic bias -- arising from differences in vocabulary and content focus between domains -- remains a persistent challenge, leading to misaligned item embeddings and reduced generalization across domains. To address this, we propose a novel semantic bias-aware framework that enhances LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain alignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we introduce a generalization loss that aligns the embeddings of items across domains (inter-domain compactness), while preserving the unique characteristics of each item within its own domain (intra-domain diversity). This ensures that item embeddings can be transferred effectively between domains without collapsing into overly generic or uniform representations.

Across three standard unlearning methods, UPCORE consistently achieves a superior balance between the competing objectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better evaluate this trade-off, we introduce a new metric, measuring the area-under-the-curve (AUC) across standard metrics.

To efficiently compress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with attention-based scoring with the task loss.

To fix this problem, we propose a Multi-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework and reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs for different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by randomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each node in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by considering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated with any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on multiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and show that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling method, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the encoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the key to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less important according to domain knowledge."}

These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized, maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically, TaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to preserve task-specific weights.

We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones.

Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales. This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short and long-term optimization.

Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information. To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA, open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes beyond the training horizon.

In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability; however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks, comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed Accidental Correction Rate (ACR)."}

To address these limitations, we propose cross-layer VQ-VAE (CLVQ-VAE), a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines top-k temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while maintaining code-book diversity.

This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information, facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms: 3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of 0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor (ET) region."}

We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first benchmark framework for evaluating multi-turn programming assistance in realistic settings that address real-world questions about actual codebases. Unlike existing programming Q&A benchmarks, CAB automatically generates scalable datasets from question-related GitHub issues using configurable parameters (e.g., repository creation date, star count, programming languages), and includes automatic containerization of codebases for evaluation. It then evaluates models through simulated users in these containerized environments with full codebase access. Using this framework, we constructed a test set of 3,286 real-world programming questions across 231 repositories, spanning seven programming languages and diverse problem domains. Our evaluation of leading LLMs reveals a substantial capability gap: while models perform well on Stack Overflow questions with success rates of 70-83%, they resolve only up to 16.49% of CAB's recent issues. This discrepancy highlights the challenges of providing assistance in complex, project-specific contexts versus answering standalone questions."}

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However, preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications. Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely low-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within 24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of 0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67 $\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs.

We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways.

What permits us to draw in globally relevant information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture'' (MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language; (ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines, under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating human reasoning in open-ended domains."}

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e., whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al., 2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps, layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants' ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans."}

Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE) tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed, suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for more robust and flexible pipelines."}

We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic personas improves alignment with human judgments.

In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and lower computational costs."}

Through comparing minimal pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs. a non-taxonomic relation.

Although existing studies have predominantly focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and 18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1. The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine, instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.

We then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs. Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately, this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers advancing context-aware AI."}

We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns, contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on reasoning beyond \"common sense\", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly simple joke forms."}

We prove a dichotomy based on the quality of the score-matching network in a diffusion model. In one direction, a network that exactly computes the score function of some initial distribution can only perform language modeling within the $\\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class, reflecting limitations tied to rapid convergence. In the other direction, we show that if there is no requirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion modeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy provides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion models, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We conjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where the diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good. We also discuss the wider context and practical implications, and hypothesize that a machine learning architecture that can interpolate between sequential and parallel modes of operation would be superior to both Transformers and diffusion models."}

Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++ introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference, it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs, while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge (Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and (2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion and focused resource allocation.

The most common is the use of automated benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models. The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented, showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived quality of the responses that justifies their use."}

However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio.

LC-CoT employs a three-step process. Initially, it assesses whether supplementary external knowledge is necessary. Subsequently, it uses API calls to retrieve this knowledge, which can be processed by a separate LLM. Finally, a manual exemplar guides the LLM to infer stance categories, using an if-then logical structure to maintain relevance and logical coherence.

However, Mixtral 8x7B suffers from high hallucinations for 3 books, rising as high as a SHI of 0.87 (in the range 0-1, where 1 is the worst). The strong negative correlation of accuracy and SHI, given by r, demonstrates the fidelity of the new hallucination metric, which may generalize to other tasks. We also show that prediction accuracies correlate positively with the frequencies of Wikipedia instances of the book titles instead of the downloads and we perform error analyses of predictions. We publicly release the annotated chunks of data and our codes to aid the reproducibility and evaluation of other models."}

However, challenges arise when processing speech transcripts that describe complex scenarios, as they are verbose and include repetition, hedging, and vagueness. E.g., during a company's earnings call, an executive might project a positive revenue outlook to reassure investors, despite uncertainty regarding future earnings. It is crucial for LLMs to incorporate this uncertainty systematically when making decisions. In this paper, we introduce \\textsc{DeFine}, a modular framework that constructs probabilistic factor profiles from complex scenarios. It then integrates these profiles with analogical reasoning, leveraging insights from similar past experiences to guide LLMs in making critical decisions in new situations. Our framework separates the tasks of quantifying uncertainty and incorporating it into LLM decision-making.

Though many efforts have been made to identify task groupings and to measure the relatedness among different tasks, it remains a challenging research topic to define a metric to identify the best task grouping out of a pool of many potential task combinations. We propose a metric of task relatedness based on task difficulty measured by pointwise V-usable information (PVI). PVI is a recently proposed metric to estimate how much usable information a dataset contains given a model. We hypothesize that tasks with not statistically different PVI estimates are similar enough to benefit from the joint learning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the feasibility of this metric for task grouping on 15 NLP datasets in the general, biomedical, and clinical domains. We compare the results of the joint learners against single learners, existing baseline methods, and recent large language models, including Llama 2 and GPT-4. The results show that by grouping tasks with similar PVI estimates, the joint learners yielded competitive results with fewer total parameters, with consistent performance across domains."}

Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed.

In this paper, we propose Mixing Preference Optimization (MPO), a post-processing framework for aggregating single-objective policies as an alternative to both multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF) and MaxMin-RLHF. MPO avoids alignment from scratch. Instead, it log-linearly combines existing policies into a unified one with the weight of each policy computed via a batch stochastic mirror descent.

This paper investigates the response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts - we test nine diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so, we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also show that all tested models exhibit a consistent recency bias varying in intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate synthetic survey data."}

RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate: (1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and RLLMs in the field of financial question answering."}

While recent LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''), they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over 260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases. We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and 18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the overall performance of SEALGuard.

However, since different apps may implement the same functionality in different ways, direct mapping may result in incomplete or buggy test cases, thus significantly impacting the effectiveness of testing target functionality and the practical applicability of migration approaches.In this paper, we propose a new migration paradigm (i.e., the abstraction-concretization paradigm) that first abstracts the test logic for the target functionality and then utilizes this logic to generate the concrete GUI test case. Furthermore, we introduce MACdroid, the first approach that migrates GUI test cases based on this paradigm. Specifically, we propose an abstraction technique that utilizes source test cases from source apps targeting the same functionality to extract a general test logic for that functionality. Then, we propose a concretization technique that utilizes the general test logic to guide an LLM in generating the corresponding GUI test case (including events and assertions) for the target app. We evaluate MACdroid on two widely-used datasets (including 31 apps, 34 functionalities, and 123 test cases). On the FrUITeR dataset, the test cases generated by MACdroid successfully test 64% of the target functionalities, improving the baselines by 191%.

Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly atthis https URL."}

This requires deleting or \"forgetting\" a set of data points from an already-trained model, which typically degrades its performance on other data points. Thus, a balance must be struck between removing information and keeping the model's other abilities intact, with a failure to balance this trade-off leading to poor deletion or an unusable model. To this end, we propose UPCORE (Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), a method-agnostic data selection framework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning. Finding that the model damage is correlated with the variance of the model's representations on the forget set, we selectively prune the forget set to remove outliers, thereby minimizing model degradation after unlearning. Across three standard unlearning methods, UPCORE consistently achieves a superior balance between the competing objectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better evaluate this trade-off, we introduce a new metric, measuring the area-under-the-curve (AUC) across standard metrics. Our results show that UPCORE improves both standard metrics and AUC, benefiting from positive transfer between the coreset and pruned points while reducing negative transfer from the forget set to points outside of it."}

To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a \"small but mighty\" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 23.4% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement, including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities.

We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit Quantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery, directly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits -- which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance. These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized, maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically, TaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to preserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing mixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose and task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for both Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the same calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements in the 2 and 3-bit regime. With only 3.1 bits we are able to recover 96% of Llama-3-8B-Instruct's unquantized 16-bit MMLU performance, obtaining a 5.25% absolute improvement over SPQR. We also observe consistently large gains over existing methods in the 2-bit regime, with an average gain of 14.74% over the strongest baseline, SliM-LLM.

Our approach uniquely combines top-k temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while maintaining code-book diversity.

Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution, which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps. Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods."}

Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++ introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference, it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs, while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

This study presents the first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows, encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows, we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift. The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally, workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop mapping.

Recently, zero-shot learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information (incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier. Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI categories, respectively."}

In this study, an innovative imaging omics framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population, which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS). Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under metabolic stress. By linking detailedvascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust, non-invasive biomarkers.

The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters."}

While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g., bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named \\textbf{\\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\\textbf{\\underline{S}}cale scenarios with multi\\textbf{\\underline{V}}iew and multi\\textbf{\\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding and design the LVLM named \\textbf{\\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).

Fortunately, foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder, overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process. Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced. To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning."}

Existing VQA methods primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics of video content.

The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts, and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented scene representation.

In this paper, we propose a fundamental question generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the training data with fundamental scene information.

For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text, without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context of the reference image.

Especially, the new era has witnessed a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds. Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model (3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings.

Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers, leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting algorithm that enhances reliability.

Using real clinical data consisting of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning, along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of cardiac disease prediction tasks.

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space. Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

Maintaining the provided performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning. Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99% of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x."}

To address this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection (DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality.

Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each cluster.

This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions, enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons.

The detection task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities. Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images, employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and comprehensive ablation studies.

Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA) module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and 6.5% AP75.

However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes, creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos with generic content.

Traditional flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions (e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target, up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and 2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures.

In this work, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability.

This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone.

In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model.

Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b) Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions; and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets, both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.

Recognizing the importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks, capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements. This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway ballast and railpad stiffness parameters.

This architecture allows for the effective handling of features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to perform tasks such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more with low-resolution images. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in these areas with fewer parameters, showcasing its potential for broad application in real-world scenarios where capturing high-resolution images is not feasible.

Unlike existing methods that rely on reconstruction or retrieval techniques or recent approaches that employ multi-stage object-by-object generation, MIDI extends pre-trained image-to-3D object generation models to multi-instance diffusion models, enabling the simultaneous generation of multiple 3D instances with accurate spatial relationships and high generalizability. At its core, MIDI incorporates a novel multi-instance attention mechanism, that effectively captures inter-object interactions and spatial coherence directly within the generation process, without the need for complex multi-step processes. The method utilizes partial object images and global scene context as inputs, directly modeling object completion during 3D generation. During training, we effectively supervise the interactions between 3D instances using a limited amount of scene-level data, while incorporating single-object data for regularization, thereby maintaining the pre-trained generalization ability. MIDI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in image-to-scene generation, validated through evaluations on synthetic data, real-world scene data, and stylized scene images generated by text-to-image diffusion models."}

Lampert", "title": "Intriguing Properties of Robust Classification", "abstract": "Despite extensive research since the community learned about adversarial examples 10 years ago, we still do not know how to train high-accuracy classifiers that are guaranteed to be robust to small perturbations of their inputs. Previous works often argued that this might be because no classifier exists that is robust and accurate at the same time. However, in computer vision this assumption does not match reality where humans are usually accurate and robust on most tasks of interest. We offer an alternative explanation and show that in certain settings robust generalization is only possible with unrealistically large amounts of data. Specifically, we find a setting where a robust classifier exists, it is easy to learn an accurate classifier, yet it requires an exponential amount of data to learn a robust classifier. Based on this theoretical result, we evaluate the influence of the amount of training data on datasets such as CIFAR-10. Our findings indicate that the amount of training data is the main factor determining the robust performance. Furthermore we show that there are low magnitude directions in the data which are useful for non-robust generalization but are not available for robust classifiers.

Recent efforts have shifted toward training a single model capable of handling multiple classes. However, directly extending early AD methods to multi-class settings often results in degraded performance. In this paper, we investigate this performance degradation observed in reconstruction-based methods, identifying the key issue: inter-class confusion. This confusion emerges when a model trained in multi-class scenarios incorrectly reconstructs samples from one class as those of another, thereby exacerbating reconstruction errors. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective modification, called class-aware contrastive learning (CCL). By explicitly leveraging raw object category information (\\eg carpet or wood) as supervised signals, we introduce local CL to refine multiscale dense features, and global CL to obtain more compact feature representations of normal patterns, thereby effectively adapting the models to multi-class settings. Experiments across five datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, ablation studies indicate that pseudo-class labels can achieve comparable performance."}

It is especially challenging in poor lighting and with fast motion. This is partly due to limitations of RGB cameras: To capture frames under low lighting, the exposure time needs to be increased, which leads to more motion blur. In contrast, event cameras, which record changes in pixel brightness asynchronously, are much less dependent on lighting, making them more suitable for recording fast motion. We hence propose the first method to spatiotemporally reconstruct a scene from sparse multi-view event streams and sparse RGB frames. We train a sequence of cross-faded time-conditioned NeRF models, one per short recording segment. The individual segments are supervised with a set of event- and RGB-based losses and sparse-view regularisation. We assemble a real-world multi-view camera rig with six static event cameras around the object and record a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset of challenging motions.

To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, also Markov properties of the high-order degradation process and Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution.

In this paper, we introduce the Attribute-aware Prompt Attack (AP-Attack), a novel method that leverages VLM's image-text alignment capability to explicitly disrupt fine-grained semantic features of pedestrian images by destroying attribute-specific textual embeddings. To obtain personalized textual descriptions for individual attributes, textual inversion networks are designed to map pedestrian images to pseudo tokens that represent semantic embeddings, trained in the contrastive learning manner with images and a predefined prompt template that explicitly describes the pedestrian attributes. Inverted benign and adversarial fine-grained textual semantics facilitate attacker in effectively conducting thorough disruptions, enhancing the transferability of adversarial examples.

In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding.

To address this issue, we argue that the information capacity of embeddings is crucial and propose Dense-to-Sparse Feature Distilled Visual Semantic Embedding (D2S-VSE), which enhances the information capacity of sparse text by leveraging dense text distillation. Specifically, D2S-VSE is a two-stage framework. In the pre-training stage, we align images with dense text to enhance the information capacity of visual semantic embeddings. In the fine-tuning stage, we optimize two tasks simultaneously, distilling dense text embeddings to sparse text embeddings while aligning images and sparse texts, enhancing the information capacity of sparse text embeddings.

Recently, compositional visual reasoning approaches, which leverage the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) with integrated tools to solve problems, have shown promise as more effective strategies than end-to-end VR methods. However, these approaches face limitations, as frozen LLMs lack tool awareness in VR, leading to performance bottlenecks. While leveraging LLMs for reasoning is widely used in other domains, they are not directly applicable to VR due to limited training data, imperfect tools that introduce errors and reduce data collection efficiency in VR, and challenging in fine-tuning on noisy workflows. To address these challenges, we propose DWIM: i) Discrepancy-aware training Workflow generation, which assesses tool usage and extracts more viable workflows for training; and ii) Instruct-Masking fine-tuning, which guides the model to only clone effective actions, enabling the generation of more practical solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that DWIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various VR tasks, exhibiting strong generalization on multiple widely-used datasets."}

However, these methods often consider only a single type of low-level information, which may lead to suboptimal generalization. Through empirical analysis, we have discovered a key insight: different low-level information often exhibits generalization capabilities for different types of forgeries. Furthermore, we found that simple fusion strategies are insufficient to leverage the detection advantages of each low-level and high-level information for various forgery types. Therefore, we propose the Adaptive Low-level Experts Injection (ALEI) framework. Our approach introduces Lora Experts, enabling the backbone network, which is trained with high-level semantic RGB images, to accept and learn knowledge from different low-level information. We utilize a cross-attention method to adaptively fuse these features at intermediate layers. To prevent the backbone network from losing the modeling capabilities of different low-level features during the later stages of modeling, we developed a Low-level Information Adapter that interacts with the features extracted by the backbone network. Finally, we propose Dynamic Feature Selection, which dynamically selects the most suitable features for detecting the current image to maximize generalization detection capability.

In video editing scenarios, models must process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong background knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw videos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this report, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a wide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on temporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos corresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent editing. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong temporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain queries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also present the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video duration: significantly longer than videos of existing temporal retrival datasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format: diverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges are manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support evaluation over multiple time ranges.

However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation (DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation.

Ellen Grant,Polina Golland", "title": "Fetuses Made Simple: Modeling and Tracking of Fetal Shape and Pose", "abstract": "Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$ subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size. To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in prenatal diagnostics.

In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability; however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks, comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed Accidental Correction Rate (ACR)."}

This practice has two key limitations: (1) it fails to account for the extreme spatial sparsity of annotations -- over 95% of 8x8 blocks are empty across standard benchmarks, so supervision signals in informative regions are diluted by the predominant zeros; (2) MSE corresponds to a Gaussian error model that poorly matches discrete, non-negative count data. To address these issues, we introduce ZIP, a scalable crowd counting framework that models blockwise counts with a Zero-Inflated Poisson likelihood: a zero-inflation term learns the probability a block is structurally empty (handling excess zeros), while the Poisson component captures expected counts when people are present (respecting discreteness). We provide a generalization analysis showing a tighter risk bound for ZIP than MSE-based losses and DMCount provided that the training resolution is moderately large.

Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely low-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within 24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of 0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67 $\\pm$ 0.11.

They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet.

While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \\textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the concept, we first formulate the \\textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \\textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \\textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT.

Assessment of WMH is important in research and clinics. However, WMH are challenging to segment due to their high variability in shape, location, size, poorly defined borders, and similar intensity profile to other pathologies (e.g stroke lesions) and artefacts (e.g head motion). In this work, we assess the utility and semantic properties of the most effective techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in segmentation for the WMH segmentation task across multiple test-time data distributions. We find UQ techniques reduce 'silent failure' by identifying in UQ maps small WMH clusters in the deep white matter that are unsegmented by the model. A combination of Stochastic Segmentation Networks with Deep Ensembles also yields the highest Dice and lowest Absolute Volume Difference % (AVD) score and can highlight areas where there is ambiguity between WMH and stroke lesions. We further demonstrate the downstream utility of UQ, proposing a novel method for classification of the clinical Fazekas score using spatial features extracted from voxelwise WMH probability and UQ maps. We show that incorporating WMH uncertainty information improves Fazekas classification performance and calibration. Our model with (UQ and spatial WMH features)/(spatial WMH features)/(WMH volume only) achieves a balanced accuracy score of 0.74/0.67/0.62, and root brier score of 0.65/0.72/0.74 in the Deep WMH and balanced accuracy of 0.74/0.73/0.71 and root brier score of 0.64/0.66/0.68 in the Periventricular region.

We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\\approx40\\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable models."}

While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, learn directly from image data, radiomics-based models extract handcrafted features, offering potential advantages in data-limited scenarios. We systematically compared the diagnostic performance of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons for radiomics, against state-of-the-art deep learning models such as InceptionV3, EfficientNetL, and ConvNeXtXLarge. Performance was evaluated across multiple sample sizes. At 24 samples, EfficientNetL achieved an AUC of 0.839, outperforming SVM with an AUC of 0.762. At 4000 samples, InceptionV3 achieved the highest AUC of 0.996, compared to 0.885 for Random Forest. A Scheirer-Ray-Hare test confirmed significant main and interaction effects of model type and sample size on all metrics. Post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction further revealed consistent performance advantages for deep learning models across most conditions. These findings provide statistically validated, data-driven recommendations for model selection in diagnostic AI. Deep learning models demonstrated higher performance and better scalability with increasing data availability, while radiomics-based models may remain useful in low-data contexts. This study addresses a critical gap in AI-based diagnostic research by offering practical guidance for deploying AI models across diverse clinical environments."}

Existing methods for synthesising Colour Fundus Photographs (CFPs) largely rely on predefined disease labels, which restricts their ability to generate images that reflect fine-grained anatomical variations, subtle disease stages, and diverse pathological features beyond coarse class categories. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce an innovative pipeline that creates a large-scale, captioned retinal dataset comprising 1.4 million entries, called RetinaLogos-1400k. Specifically, RetinaLogos-1400k uses the visual language model(VLM) to describe retinal conditions and key structures, such as optic disc configuration, vascular distribution, nerve fibre layers, and pathological features. Building on this dataset, we employ a novel three-step training framework, RetinaLogos, which enables fine-grained semantic control over retinal images and accurately captures different stages of disease progression, subtle anatomical variations, and specific lesion types. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance across multiple datasets, with 62.07% of text-driven synthetic CFPs indistinguishable from real ones by ophthalmologists.

Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations? We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task - preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model scale on representational convergence.

One of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.

This work focuses instead on the increasingly critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large, industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams operate in iterative update-debug cycles.

Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities from scratch."}

Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines, demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by standard FL.

Operator learning approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial differential equations.

First, we train a predictor network to mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions. Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations.

However, although follow-up works have explored the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for a two-layer linear network.

Existing DCT methods mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions. Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair. Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images). Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments."}

In this paper, we propose leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric (data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning scenarios."}

Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this, we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding policy ($\\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the training of the target policy ($\\pion$). This approach improves training stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size. Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods, demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning.

This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer.

However, training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings. Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying capabilities remain idle.

Most state-of-the-art (SOTA) KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent all the relations.

Based on this ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space.

Our framework naturally extends to powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based reinforcement learning."}

Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models."}

In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22% and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3) respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs, and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets."}

The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\\Omega(n^2)$ representation that explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the \\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic complexity with $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity. The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line, which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation space."}

This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training. We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text.

We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field.

This review explores an AI architectural path inspired by the brain's structure, particularly the minicolumn hypothesis, which views the neocortex as a distributed system of repeated modules - a structure we connect to collective intelligence (CI). Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural modules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical, theoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We distinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and parameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated across a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness, adaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module tends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers capable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may offer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy efficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust embodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such systems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are still lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an emerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped potential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a system that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and functional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI problems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization."}

Moreover, we identified optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift. The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally, workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop mapping.

This paper focuses on a sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning. We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions \"What\" and \"How\". The first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.

Despite advances in multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy: time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%, and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on low-end or wearable devices."}

Briefly, we aim to find a filter $h^*$, which applied to any music or speech, will maximize the user's satisfaction. This is a black-box optimization problem since the user's satisfaction function is unknown. Substantive work has been done on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user, each shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their satisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate\" functions is then designed to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines these functions to arrive at the filter $\\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes satisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of querying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$ of the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is to cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score various cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual ingredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$ queries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe that will maximize this user's satisfaction. Our proposal builds on Sparse Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and shows how a hybrid approach can outperform any one type of querying. Our results are validated through simulations and real world experiments, where volunteers gave feedback on music/speech audio and were able to achieve high satisfaction levels. We believe this idea of hybrid querying opens new problems in black-box optimization and solutions can benefit other applications beyond audio personalization."}

In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer networks with different backbones.

This situation sets the study apart from a standard randomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to this situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To address this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated propensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these methods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve this issue, a novel method called the \"Self balancing neural network\" (Sbnet), which lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the balancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the average treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the feedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the average treatment effect in one step. Moreover, the multi-pseudo propensity score framework, which is estimated from the diversified balancing net and used for the estimation of the average treatment effect, is presented.

However, these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, \\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24.

Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as \"go straight\" or \"turn right.\" However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents in the context of autonomous driving."}

In this paper, we propose a DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image generation quality and model stability.

Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger fracture-focused dataset."}

While effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention effectiveness.

Maintaining the provided performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning. Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99% of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x."}

To address this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection (DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy correspondence for training acceleration.

This leads to the task of finding positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence.

The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite variance when $p\\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively studied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth optimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all Lipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding of the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two types of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability convergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under sub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation convergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are conducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex objectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that the theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and number of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the case of smooth objectives.

We show that common weighting schemes, such as pooling all data, exponentially weighting data, and using only the most recent data, emerge naturally as special cases in our framework. We demonstrate that RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample predictive performance when applied as a fine-tuning step on the Yearbook dataset, across a range of benchmark methods in Wild-Time. Moreover, we show that RIDER outperforms standard weighting strategies in two other real-world tasks: predicting stock market volatility and forecasting ride durations in NYC taxi data."}

Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model (WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50 demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play."}

However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio.

To generate data via a flow matching model, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution remains identical across levels of the hierarchy.

In this paper, we introduce Pref-RMAB, a new RMAB model in the presence of \\textit{preference} signals, where the decision maker only observes pairwise preference feedback rather than scalar reward from the activated arms at each decision epoch. Preference feedback, however, arguably contains less information than the scalar reward, which makes Pref-RMAB seemingly more difficult.

Over the last decade or so, the increased availability of large-scale meteorological datasets and the development of powerful machine learning models have opened up new opportunities for data-driven weather forecasting. Focusing on Ghana in this study, we use these tools to develop two U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) models, to predict 24h rainfall at 12h and 30h lead-time. The models were trained using data from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, and the GPM-IMERG dataset. A special attention was paid to interpretability. We developed a novel statistical methodology that allowed us to probe the relative importance of the meteorological variables input in our model, offering useful insights into the factors that drive precipitation in the Ghana region.

While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \\textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the concept, we first formulate the \\textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \\textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \\textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline."}

In this paper, we take a further step and introduce a \\emph{personalized} FedRL framework (PFedRL) by taking advantage of possibly shared common structure among agents in heterogeneous environments. Specifically, we develop a class of PFedRL algorithms named PFedRL-Rep that learns (1) a shared feature representation collaboratively among all agents, and (2) an agent-specific weight vector personalized to its local environment. We analyze the convergence of PFedTD-Rep, a particular instance of the framework with temporal difference (TD) learning and linear representations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to prove a linear convergence speedup with respect to the number of agents in the PFedRL setting. To achieve this, we show that PFedTD-Rep is an example of the federated two-timescale stochastic approximation with Markovian noise.

Domain adaptation (DA) methods include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\\approx40\\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases.

To this end, we propose UPCORE (Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), a method-agnostic data selection framework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning.

To efficiently compress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with attention-based scoring with the task loss. However, this often results in simply removing nodes with lower degrees without consideration of their feature-level relevance to the given task. To fix this problem, we propose a Multi-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework and reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs for different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by randomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each node in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by considering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated with any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on multiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and show that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling method, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the encoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the key to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less important according to domain knowledge."}

We present a foundation model framework for universal human mobility patterns that leverages cross-domain data fusion and large language models to address these limitations. Our approach integrates multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel trajectory dataset. Our framework demonstrates adaptability through domain transfer techniques that ensure transferability across diverse urban contexts, as evidenced in case studies of Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt. The framework employs LLMs for semantic enrichment of trajectory data, enabling comprehensive understanding of mobility patterns. Quantitative evaluation shows that our generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in empirical data. The practical utility of this foundation model approach is demonstrated through large-scale traffic simulations for LA County, where results align well with observed traffic data. On California's I-405 corridor, the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85% for traffic volume and 4.36% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations, illustrating the framework's potential for intelligent transportation systems and urban mobility applications."}

While proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting of precise forecasts, they fall short when forecasters face epistemic uncertainty about their beliefs, limiting their use in safety-critical domains where decision-makers (DMs) prioritize proper uncertainty management. To address this, we propose a framework for scoring imprecise forecasts -- forecasts given as a set of beliefs. Despite existing impossibility results for deterministic scoring rules, we enable truthful elicitation by drawing connection to social choice theory and introducing a two-way communication framework where DMs first share their aggregation rules (e.g., averaging or min-max) used in downstream decisions for resolving forecast ambiguity. This, in turn, helps forecasters resolve indecision during elicitation. We further show that truthful elicitation of imprecise forecasts is achievable using proper scoring rules randomized over the aggregation procedure. Our approach allows DM to elicit and integrate the forecaster's epistemic uncertainty into their decision-making process, thus improving credibility."}

In the standard deep Q-network (DQN), the target network is a copy of the online network's weights, held fixed for a number of iterations before being periodically replaced via a hard update. While this stabilizes training by providing consistent targets, it introduces a new challenge: the hard update period must be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose two gradient-based target update methods: DQN with asymmetric gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN) and DQN with symmetric gradient target tracking (SGT2-DQN). These methods replace the conventional hard target updates with continuous and structured updates using gradient descent, which effectively eliminates the need for manual tuning. We provide a theoretical analysis proving the convergence of these methods in tabular settings. Additionally, empirical evaluations demonstrate their advantages over standard DQN baselines, which suggest that gradient-based target updates can serve as an effective alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in Q-learning."}

We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit Quantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery, directly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits -- which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance. These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized, maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically, TaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to preserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing mixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose and task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for both Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the same calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements in the 2 and 3-bit regime.

Therefore, we introduce crowd-hpo as a framework for evaluating approaches to learning from crowds in combination with criteria to select well-performing hyperparameter configurations with access only to noisy crowd-labeled validation data. Extensive experiments with neural networks demonstrate that these criteria select hyperparameter configurations, which improve the learning from crowd approaches' generalization performances, measured on separate test sets with ground truth labels.

Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales. This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short and long-term optimization.

We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task - preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model scale on representational convergence.

This work revisits the inductive biases in Geographically Neural Network Weighted Regression (GNNWR) and identifies limitations in current approaches for modeling spatial non-stationarity. While GNNWR extends traditional Geographically Weighted Regression by using neural networks to learn spatial weighting functions, existing implementations are often restricted by fixed distance-based schemes and limited inductive bias. We propose to generalize GNNWR by incorporating concepts from convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers, introducing local receptive fields, sequential context, and self-attention into spatial regression. Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic spatial datasets with varying heterogeneity, noise, and sample sizes, we show that GNNWR outperforms classic methods in capturing nonlinear and complex spatial relationships. Our results also reveal that model performance depends strongly on data characteristics, with local models excelling in highly heterogeneous or small-sample scenarios, and global models performing better with larger, more homogeneous data.

Recently, a machine learning approach known as physics-informed neural network, which solves PDEs using neural networks by minimizing the sum of residuals from the PDEs, BCs, and data, has gained significant attention in the scientific community. In this study, we investigate a physics-informed linear model (PILM) that uses linear combinations of basis functions to represent solutions, thereby enabling an analytical representation of optimal solutions. The PILM was formulated and verified for illustrative forward and inverse problems including cases with uncertain BCs. Furthermore, the PILM was applied to estimate crustal strain rates using geodetic data. Specifically, physical regularization that enforces elastic equilibrium on the velocity fields was compared with mathematical regularization that imposes smoothness constraints. From a Bayesian perspective, mathematical regularization exhibited superior performance. The PILM provides an analytically solvable framework applicable to linear forward and inverse problems, underdetermined systems, and physical regularization."}

The worst-class error is important in many applications.

In this work, we present a novel deep learning-based spatiotemporal downscaling method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for generating historically accurate high-resolution wind resource data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting Reanalysis version 5 data (ERA5). In contrast to previous approaches, which used coarsened high-resolution data as low-resolution training data, we use true low-resolution simulation outputs. We show that by training a GAN model with ERA5 as the low-resolution input and Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkit (WTK) data as the high-resolution target, we achieved results comparable in historical accuracy and spatiotemporal variability to conventional dynamical downscaling. This GAN-based downscaling method additionally reduces computational costs over dynamical downscaling by two orders of magnitude. We applied this approach to downscale 30 km, hourly ERA5 data to 2 km, 5 min wind data for January 2000 through December 2023 at multiple hub heights over Ukraine, Moldova, and part of Romania.

In this work, we assess the utility and semantic properties of the most effective techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in segmentation for the WMH segmentation task across multiple test-time data distributions. We find UQ techniques reduce 'silent failure' by identifying in UQ maps small WMH clusters in the deep white matter that are unsegmented by the model. A combination of Stochastic Segmentation Networks with Deep Ensembles also yields the highest Dice and lowest Absolute Volume Difference % (AVD) score and can highlight areas where there is ambiguity between WMH and stroke lesions. We further demonstrate the downstream utility of UQ, proposing a novel method for classification of the clinical Fazekas score using spatial features extracted from voxelwise WMH probability and UQ maps. We show that incorporating WMH uncertainty information improves Fazekas classification performance and calibration. Our model with (UQ and spatial WMH features)/(spatial WMH features)/(WMH volume only) achieves a balanced accuracy score of 0.74/0.67/0.62, and root brier score of 0.65/0.72/0.74 in the Deep WMH and balanced accuracy of 0.74/0.73/0.71 and root brier score of 0.64/0.66/0.68 in the Periventricular region.

Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases."}

Yet its reliance on a singular reward model often overlooks the diversity of human preferences. Recent approaches address this limitation by leveraging multi-dimensional feedback to fine-tune corresponding reward models and train LLMs using reinforcement learning. However, the process is costly and unstable, especially given the competing and heterogeneous nature of human preferences. In this paper, we propose Mixing Preference Optimization (MPO), a post-processing framework for aggregating single-objective policies as an alternative to both multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF) and MaxMin-RLHF. MPO avoids alignment from scratch. Instead, it log-linearly combines existing policies into a unified one with the weight of each policy computed via a batch stochastic mirror descent. Empirical results demonstrate that MPO achieves balanced performance across diverse preferences, outperforming or matching existing models with significantly reduced computational costs."}

Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 23.4% accuracy.

The process of finding a good set of variational parameters in the QAOA circuit has proven to be challenging due to multiple factors, such as barren plateaus. As a result, there is growing interest in exploiting parameter transferability, where parameter sets optimized for one problem instance are transferred to another that could be more complex either to estimate the solution or to serve as a warm start for further optimization. But can we transfer parameters from one class of problems to another? Leveraging parameter sets learned from a well-studied class of problems could help navigate the less studied one, reducing optimization overhead and mitigating performance pitfalls. In this paper, we study whether pretrained QAOA parameters of MaxCut can be used as is or to warm start the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) circuits.

While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, learn directly from image data, radiomics-based models extract handcrafted features, offering potential advantages in data-limited scenarios. We systematically compared the diagnostic performance of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons for radiomics, against state-of-the-art deep learning models such as InceptionV3, EfficientNetL, and ConvNeXtXLarge.

Inspired by physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist anomalies present at the initialization time.

This configuration yields useful seasonal predictions (July to November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics. Notably, the predicted and observed TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East Pacific basins are significantly correlated during 1990 to 2023 (r=~0.7), suggesting prediction skill comparable to existing physical GCMs. Despite challenges associated with model resolution and simplified boundary forcings, the model-predicted interannual variations demonstrate significant correlations with the observation, including the sub-basin TC tracks (p<0.1) and basin-wide accumulated cyclone energy (p<0.01) of the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins.

A Perspective from Data Dimensionality Reduction", "abstract": "In recent years, contrastive learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance in the territory of self-supervised representation learning. Many previous works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding underlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a default assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold in practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the strength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random resized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling error on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We first reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on downstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality reduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on original data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical and empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a double-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream classification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation graph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion that we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in our experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large graph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance."}

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However, preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications. Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely low-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within 24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of 0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67 $\\pm$ 0.11.

We analyzed 183 research papers published between January 2020 and December 2024 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In RQ1, we examine the diverse failure data sources utilized, including advanced LLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new data sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks, highlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across these tasks. RQ3 investigates the various LLM-based methods applied to address AIOps challenges. Finally, RQ4 reviews evaluation methodologies tailored to assess LLM-integrated AIOps approaches. Based on our findings, we discuss the state-of-the-art advancements and trends, identify gaps in existing research, and propose promising directions for future exploration."}

Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution. Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined transformation rules and offers a scalable solution to quantum software portability.

We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits. Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code, supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain. Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts, simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models, demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability and productivity while reducing manual effort.

Retrieval-augmented approaches first fetch code snippets with existing comments and then synthesize a new comment, yet retrieval and generation are typically optimized in isolation, allowing irrelevant neighbors topropagate noise downstream.

RAGSum is built on top offuse retrieval and generation using a single CodeT5 backbone. We report preliminary results on a unified retrieval-generation framework built on CodeT5. A contrastive pre-training phase shapes code embeddings for nearest-neighbor search; these weights then seed end-to-end training with a composite loss that (i) rewards accurate top-k retrieval; and (ii) minimizes comment-generation error. More importantly, a lightweight self-refinement loop is deployed to polish the final output. We evaluated theframework on three cross-language benchmarks (Java, Python, C), and compared it with three well-established baselines.

Meanwhile, implicit evaluation approaches in the smart grid domain focus on testing systems that utilise information and data models already in use for functionality in terms of conformance and interoperability. Notably, no combination of explicit and implicit evaluation approaches for newly designed information and data models offers a clearly defined set of steps during their design process in the smart grid context.Consequently, we design a three-phase evaluation approach using design science research to address this gap.

This study investigates the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) for automatically detecting test smells. We evaluate Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Phi-4 on 143 real-world Ubuntu test cases, covering seven types of test smells. Phi-4 achieved the best results, reaching a pass@2 of 97% in detecting sentences with test smells, while Gemma3 and Llama3.2 reached approximately 91%. Beyond detection, SLMs autonomously explained issues and suggested improvements, even without explicit prompt instructions. They enabled low-cost, concept-driven identification of diverse test smells without relying on extensive rule definitions or syntactic analysis. These findings highlight the potential of SLMs as efficient tools that preserve data privacy and can improve test quality in real-world scenarios."}

They collaboratively perform various tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses on integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world stakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an artifact pool. Agents continuously monitor the pool and autonomously trigger the next action based on its changes, enabling iReDev to handle new requirements quickly. iReDev introduces a human-in-the-loop mechanism to support human-agent collaboration, ensuring that the generated artifacts align with the expectations of stakeholders.

How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its compliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the other hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to manual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments. Although some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods for detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness when facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective solution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may undergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of CodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against input perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation module, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which systematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial samples.

Nowadays, various code-checking frameworks provide extensive checker customization interfaces to meet this need. However, both the abstract checking logic and the complex API usage of large-scale checker frameworks make this task challenging. To this end, automated code checker generation is anticipated to ease the burden of checker development. In this paper, we propose AutoChecker, an innovative LLM-powered approach that can write code checkers automatically based on only a rule description and a test suite. To achieve comprehensive checking logic, AutoChecker incrementally updates the checker's logic by focusing on solving one selected case each time. To obtain precise API knowledge, during each iteration, it leverages fine-grained logic-guided API-context retrieval, where it first decomposes the checking logic into a series of sub-operations and then retrieves checker-related API-contexts for each sub-operation. For evaluation, we apply AutoChecker, five baselines, and three ablation methods using multiple LLMs to generate checkers for 20 randomly selected PMD rules.

However, their adoption also introduces unique safety challenges, such as data leakage and biased outputs, that demand rigorous handling by downstream developers. While previous research has proposed taxonomies of AI safety concerns and various mitigation strategies, how downstream developers address these issues remains unexplored.This study investigates downstream developers' concerns, practices and perceived challenges regarding AI safety issues during AI-based software development. To achieve this, we conducted a mixed-method study, including interviews with 18 participants, a survey of 86 practitioners, and an analysis of 874 AI incidents from the AI Incident Database. Our results reveal that while developers generally demonstrate strong awareness of AI safety concerns, their practices, especially during the preparation and PTM selection phases, are often inadequate. The lack of concrete guidelines and policies leads to significant variability in the comprehensiveness of their safety approaches throughout the development lifecycle, with additional challenges such as poor documentation and knowledge gaps, further impeding effective implementation. Based on our findings, we offer suggestions for PTM developers, AI-based software developers, researchers, and policy makers to enhance the integration of AI safety measures."}

Domain experts (DEs) from different disciplines collaborate with professional software developers (SDEs), bringing complementary expertise in creating and maintaining complex production software. However, contested expectations, divergent problem-solving perspectives, and conflicting priorities lead to friction. Aims: This study aims to investigate the dynamics of emerging collaboration of cross-disciplinary software development (CDSD) by exploring the expectations held by DEs and SDEs and understanding how these frictions manifest in practice. Method: We utilize Activity Theory (AT), a well-established socio-technical framework, as an analytical lens in a grounded, empirical investigation, conducted through a mixed-method study involving 24 interviews (12 DEs and 12 SDEs) and a large-scale validation survey with 293 participants (161 DEs and 132 SDEs). Results: We conceptualize and empirically ground the CDSD dynamics. We identified eight expectations held by SDEs and six by DEs. By mapping these expectations to AT components, we revealed 21 frictions in CDSD and illustrated where and how they arise. Conclusions: This study offers a theoretical lens for understanding the dynamics and frictions in CDSD and provides actionable insights for future research, practitioners, and infrastructure design."}

Recent efforts like InfiBench and StackEval attempt to address this gap using Stack Overflow data but remain limited to single-turn interactions in isolated contexts, require significant manual curation, and fail to represent complete project environments. We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first benchmark framework for evaluating multi-turn programming assistance in realistic settings that address real-world questions about actual codebases. Unlike existing programming Q&A benchmarks, CAB automatically generates scalable datasets from question-related GitHub issues using configurable parameters (e.g., repository creation date, star count, programming languages), and includes automatic containerization of codebases for evaluation. It then evaluates models through simulated users in these containerized environments with full codebase access. Using this framework, we constructed a test set of 3,286 real-world programming questions across 231 repositories, spanning seven programming languages and diverse problem domains. Our evaluation of leading LLMs reveals a substantial capability gap: while models perform well on Stack Overflow questions with success rates of 70-83%, they resolve only up to 16.49% of CAB's recent issues. This discrepancy highlights the challenges of providing assistance in complex, project-specific contexts versus answering standalone questions."}

Recent studies have uncovered severe data contamination issues, e.g. SWE-bench reports 32.67% of successful patches involve direct solution leakage and 31.08% pass due to inadequate test cases. We introduce SWE-MERA, a dynamic, continuously updated benchmark designed to address these fundamental challenges through an automated collection of real-world GitHub issues and rigorous quality validation. Our approach implements a reliable pipeline that ensures quality while minimizing contamination risks, resulting in approximately 10,000 potential tasks with 300 samples currently available. Evaluation using the Aider coding agent demonstrates strong discriminative power in state-of-the-art models. We report performance across a dozen recent LLMs evaluated on tasks collected between September 2024 and June 2025."}

Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family, specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in model development, and standardize evaluation procedures."}

This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available atthis https URL."}
