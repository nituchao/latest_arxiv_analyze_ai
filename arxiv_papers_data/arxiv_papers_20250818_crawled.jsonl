Although first-order rules are commonly used in ASPIC+ examples, most existing approaches to reason over rule-based argumentation only support propositional rules. To enable reasoning over first-order instances, a preliminary grounding step is required. As groundings can lead to an exponential increase in the size of the input theories, intelligent procedures are needed. However, there is a lack of dedicated solutions for ASPIC+. Therefore, we propose an intelligent grounding procedure that keeps the size of the grounding manageable while preserving the correctness of the reasoning process. To this end, we translate the first-order ASPIC+ instance into a Datalog program and query a Datalog engine to obtain ground substitutions to perform the grounding of rules and contraries. Additionally, we propose simplifications specific to the ASPIC+ formalism to avoid grounding of rules that have no influence on the reasoning process. Finally, we performed an empirical evaluation of a prototypical implementation to show scalability."}

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals with actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven decisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual (i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world applications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing outcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the inherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact and compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple recourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction as a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided by both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse costs, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap between individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a three-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal capacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware optimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs. Experimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that our framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve near-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings. This work extends algorithmic recourse from individual recommendations to system-level design, providing a tractable path toward higher social welfare while maintaining individual actionability."}

To achieve this, experience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally expensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts have been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most time-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on theory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and integrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to automatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning time. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by learning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we integrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed for LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability issue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy network, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based on objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in this study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves the effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively. In conjunction with the PPO-based learned virtual planner, plans generated by our framework within an average of 2.55 hours show improved or comparable OAR sparing with superior target coverage for patients with different prescription dose levels, number of target volumes, beam angles, etc., compared with human-generated plans."}

More specifically, we study two prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from abstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the respective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes called non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the relations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general non-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been recently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions cannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated for ABA so far. We introduce strong admissibility for ABA and investigate desirable properties. We furthermore extend the recent investigations of weak admissibility in the flat ABA fragment to the non-flat case. We show that the central modularization property is maintained under classical, strong, and weak admissibility. We also show that strong and weakly admissible semantics in non-flat ABA share some of the shortcomings of standard admissible semantics and discuss ways to address these."}

Based on the dataset, our systematical evaluation of LRMs reveals their inability in proactively asking for information. In addition, we uncover the behaviors related to overthinking and hallucination of LRMs, and highlight the potential and challenges of supervised fine-tuning in learning such ability.

However, real-world KGs are dynamically evolving with the constant addition of entities, relations and facts. To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to efficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining learned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world scenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of updates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In this paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for CKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on the update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic Distillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of learned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently outperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR, 1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with methods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal performance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive embedding dimensions in CKGE.

Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement Learning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic interactive GUI environments. However, these methods face two key limitations: (1) they overlook the significant variation in difficulty across different GUI tasks by treating the entire training data as a uniform set, which hampers the agent's ability to adapt its learning process; and (2) most approaches collapse task-specific nuances into a single, coarse reward, leaving the agent with a uniform signal that yields inefficient policy updates. To address these limitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the varying difficulty across trajectories. To enable more fine-grained policy optimization, we design a reward function that combines simple rule-based signals with model-judged evaluation, providing richer and more nuanced feedback during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches, outperforming them by 5.6% on public benchmarks Android Control and 10.3% on our internal online benchmarks, respectively. These findings empirically validate the effectiveness of integrating reinforcement learning with curriculum learning in GUI interaction tasks."}

This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to effectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications of biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents in uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of inventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs typically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those observed in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the pull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and implementation of information sharing. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the potential biases in deploying LLMs in Inventory decision-making scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with problem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into multiple simpler sub-tasks.

We empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple domains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving large-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs effectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where infusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds particular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge within LLMs."}

In this paper, we propose a heterogeneity weighted U (HWU) method for association analyses considering genetic heterogeneity. HWU can be applied to various types of phenotypes (e.g., binary and continuous) and is computationally effcient for high- dimensional genetic data. Through simulations, we showed the advantage of HWU when the underlying genetic etiology of a disease was heterogeneous, as well as the robustness of HWU against different model assumptions (e.g., phenotype distributions). Using HWU, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of nicotine dependence from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environments (SAGE) dataset.

Converging evidence shows that genetic variants with low marginal effects (LME) play an important role in disease development. Despite their potential significance, discovering LME genetic variants and assessing their joint association on high dimensional data (e.g., genome wide association studies) remain a great challenge. To facilitate joint association analysis among a large ensemble of LME genetic variants, we proposed a computationally efficient and powerful approach, which we call Trees Assembling Mann whitney (TAMW). Through simulation studies and an empirical data application, we found that TAMW outperformed multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and the likelihood ratio based Mann whitney approach (LRMW) when the underlying complex disease involves multiple LME loci and their interactions. For instance, in a simulation with 20 interacting LME loci, TAMW attained a higher power (power=0.931) than both MDR (power=0.599) and LRMW (power=0.704). In an empirical study of 29 known Crohn's disease (CD) loci, TAMW also identified a stronger joint association with CD than those detected by MDR and LRMW. Finally, we applied TAMW to Wellcome Trust CD GWAS to conduct a genome wide analysis. The analysis of 459K single nucleotide polymorphisms was completed in 40 hours using parallel computing, and revealed a joint association predisposing to CD (p-value=2.763e-19).

While current VQA benchmarks consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing model only reaching 40\\% accuracy.

In this paper, we evaluate the extent to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant, varying the included information on vision information and example image responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants' responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05)."}

They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared on a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI applications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain? Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C, which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The core of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and, critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph, predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target domain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets against three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model for the rest."}

With a prevalence exceeding 70%, they pose a significant burden on female reproductive health. Clinical symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, pelvic pain, and pressure-related discomfort play a crucial role in guiding treatment decisions, which are largely influenced by the size, number, and anatomical location of the fibroids. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive and highly accurate imaging modality commonly used by clinicians for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Segmenting uterine fibroids requires a precise assessment of both the uterus and fibroids on MRI scans, including measurements of volume, shape, and spatial location. However, this process is labor intensive and time consuming and subjected to variability due to intra- and inter-expert differences at both pre- and post-treatment stages. As a result, there is a critical need for an accurate and automated segmentation method for uterine fibroids. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have shown re-markable improvements in medical image segmentation, outperforming traditional methods. These approaches offer the potential for fully automated segmentation. Several studies have explored the use of deep learning models to achieve automated segmentation of uterine fibroids. However, most of the previous work has been conducted using private datasets, which poses challenges for validation and comparison between studies. In this study, we leverage the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset (UMD) to establish a baseline for automated segmentation of uterine fibroids, enabling standardized evaluation and facilitating future research in this domain."}

However, in prior RLVR pipelines, the repeated use of static initial-state sampling drawn exactly from the dataset distribution during each sampling phase produced overly deterministic, low diversity model behavior, which manifested as rapid entropy collapse and hindered sustained performance gains during prolonged training. To address this issue, we introduce CURE (Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention), a two-stage framework that balances exploration and exploitation. Specifically, in the first stage, to deliberately steer the model toward novel yet coherent contexts, we re-generate at high-entropy critical tokens and jointly optimize the original and the branched trajectories. The further comparison with vanilla DAPO shows that the regeneration process achieves a better performance on math reasoning tasks while sustaining a high-level entropy degree for exploration. In the second stage, we continue training with static initial-state sampling by DAPO, intentionally placing the model in a familiar state to gradually strengthen exploitation. Extensive experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B show that, compared to other RLVR methods, CURE achieves a 5% performance gain across six math benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and accuracy. A series of experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available atthis https URL."}

We also show that the degree of unification depends on mutual information between facts and training data language, and on how easy it is to extract that language. Based on these insights, we develop methods to modulate the level of cross-lingual transfer by manipulating data distribution and tokenization, and we introduce metrics and visualizations to formally characterize their effects on unification.

However, current methods are often computationally expensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model before calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the prediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by introducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval predictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs prediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty sets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors can be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can apply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we focus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression tasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification settings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible classes. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for detecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical experiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than interval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while achieving a similar coverage over the test data."}

These database-level summaries are then used to decode parameters of interest from the underlying data distribution without requiring access to the original samples, offering an efficient and privacy-friendly learning framework. However, both the encoding and decoding techniques are typically randomized and data-independent, failing to exploit the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose a framework that meta-learns both the encoding and decoding stages of compressive learning methods by using neural networks that provide faster and more accurate systems than the current state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the potential of the presented Compressive Meta-Learning framework, we explore multiple applications -- including neural network-based compressive PCA, compressive ridge regression, compressive k-means, and autoencoders."}

A vision pipeline (YOLO for object detection and the Segment Anything Model for instance segmentation) feeds candidate object crops into the VLM, which scores their relevance given an operator prompt; in addition, the list of detected object labels is ranked by a text-only LLM. These scores weight the existing navigation and manipulation layers of GUIDER, selecting context-relevant targets while suppressing unrelated objects. Once the combined belief exceeds a threshold, autonomy changes occur, enabling the robot to navigate to the desired area and retrieve the desired object, while adapting to any changes in the operator's intent.

Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product similarity.

To address this, we propose IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability, and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels.

To date, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and operational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning.

Many existing methods treat posts independently and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Visuomotor learning offers a promising alternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low signal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and millimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This paper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor policies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a single stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic grasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical objects without retraining or task-specific models.

Among the evaluated models, only GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o were able to produce a correct solution when given the most context-rich prompt. Simpler prompting strategies failed to yield a working result, even after multiple refinement iterations. These findings highlight the need for effective mitigation techniques to ensure the safe and reliable use of LLM generated code, especially in safety-critical domains such as automotive software systems."}

In this study, we test whether the contrastive vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation framework."}

Some existing methods attempt to use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work, we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities. Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public."}

Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each featuring one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and corresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues unrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect conclusions.To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand augmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that preserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details. This pipeline ensures correctness (88--99% on average, according to human evaluation), promotes diversity, and controls reasoning complexity by leveraging Prolog-based reasoning and LLM-as-a-judge validation. It also verifies that the embedded biases are both harmful and undetectable by logic-based, unbiased reasoners.We evaluate leading GPAI systems (GPT, LLaMA, DeepSeek) and find a consistent tendency to rely on shallow linguistic heuristics over deep reasoning.

Gradient-based DFL requires computing the derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the predicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear programs (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted parameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches for LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP into a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer and then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that have informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former approach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the regret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address this, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable optimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our experiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable optimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than surrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds for DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs, that computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can be performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes the forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate losses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the state-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin."}

Existing approaches that integrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model patterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a novel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy versus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert tokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient learning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with on-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over baselines.

However, theoretical guarantees about such algorithms only exist for simple decision functions, and it is unclear whether and under which assumptions similar results might exist for complex models. In this paper, we introduce a general, learning-theory-based framework for what it means for an explanation to provide information about a decision function. We call an explanation informative if it serves to reduce the complexity of the space of plausible decision functions. With this approach, we show that many popular explanation algorithms are not informative when applied to complex decision functions, providing a rigorous mathematical rejection of the idea that it should be possible to explain any model. We then derive conditions under which different explanation algorithms become informative. These are often stronger than what one might expect. For example, gradient explanations and counterfactual explanations are non-informative with respect to the space of differentiable functions, and SHAP and anchor explanations are not informative with respect to the space of decision trees. Based on these results, we discuss how explanation algorithms can be modified to become informative. While the proposed analysis of explanation algorithms is mathematical, we argue that it holds strong implications for the practical applicability of these algorithms, particularly for auditing, regulation, and high-risk applications of AI."}

This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1 rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a practical alternative to large-scale model deployment."}

Due to the lack of fine-grained behavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies within user behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high false positive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal and anomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behavior sequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels (anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, to enhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learning discriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called Robust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres to represent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifier is constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point. Building on this, using multiple instance learning and adaptive behavior-level self-training debiasing based on model prediction confidence, the framework further refines hyper-spheres and feature representations using weak sequence-level labels. This approach enhances the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors.

Recently, it has been shown that such structures can be expressed as feature-based rules, called sketches, over a number of classical planning domains. These sketches split problems into subproblems which then become solvable in low polynomial time by a greedy sequence of IW$(k)$ searches. Methods for learning sketches using feature pools and min-SAT solvers have been developed, yet they face two key limitations: scalability and expressivity. In this work, we address these limitations by formulating the problem of learning sketch decompositions as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) task, where general policies are sought in a modified planning problem where the successor states of a state s are defined as those reachable from s through an IW$(k)$ search. The sketch decompositions obtained through this method are experimentally evaluated across various domains, and problems are regarded as solved by the decomposition when the goal is reached through a greedy sequence of IW$(k)$ searches. While our DRL approach for learning sketch decompositions does not yield interpretable sketches in the form of rules, we demonstrate that the resulting decompositions can often be understood in a crisp manner."}

Motivated by the success of automated machine learning (AutoML), this paper introduces a novel framework for the automated design of medical agent architectures. Specifically, we define a hierarchical and expressive agent search space that enables dynamic workflow adaptation through structured modifications at the node, structural, and framework levels. Our framework conceptualizes medical agents as graph-based architectures composed of diverse, functional node types and supports iterative self-improvement guided by diagnostic feedback. Experimental results on skin disease diagnosis tasks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively evolves workflow structures and significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy over time.

In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that emulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and slow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to fulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by semantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions. Furthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising a Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that analyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously improves performance.

PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and directly enhancing medical AI safety.

In this paper, a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack is proposed, which resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm (referred to as JMA) provides an optimal solution to a linearised version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. The results of the experiments confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, JMA is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in complex multi-label classification scenarios, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, JMA requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods."}

In this scenario, tokenizing (i.e., indexing) users and items becomes essential for ensuring a seamless alignment of LLMs with recommendations. While several studies have made progress in representing users and items through textual contents or latent representations, challenges remain in efficiently capturing high-order collaborative knowledge into discrete tokens that are compatible with LLMs. Additionally, the majority of existing tokenization approaches often face difficulties in generalizing effectively to new/unseen users or items that were not in the training corpus. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called TokenRec, which introduces not only an effective ID tokenization strategy but also an efficient retrieval paradigm for LLM-based recommendations. Specifically, our tokenization strategy, Masked Vector-Quantized (MQ) Tokenizer, involves quantizing the masked user/item representations learned from collaborative filtering into discrete tokens, thus achieving a smooth incorporation of high-order collaborative knowledge and a generalizable tokenization of users and items for LLM-based RecSys. Meanwhile, our generative retrieval paradigm is designed to efficiently recommend top-$K$ items for users to eliminate the need for the time-consuming auto-regressive decoding and beam search processes used by LLMs, thus significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating that TokenRec outperforms competitive benchmarks, including both traditional recommender systems and emerging LLM-based recommender systems."}

Physical triggers, which are natural objects embedded in real-world scenes, offer a promising alternative for attackers, as they can activate backdoors in real-time without digital manipulation. However, existing physical backdoor attacks are dirty-label, meaning that attackers must change the labels of poisoned inputs to the target label. The inconsistency between image content and label exposes the attack to human inspection, reducing its stealthiness in real-world settings. To address this limitation, we introduce Clean-Label Physical Backdoor Attack (CLPBA), a new paradigm of physical backdoor attack that does not require label manipulation and trigger injection at the training stage. Instead, the attacker injects imperceptible perturbations into a small number of target class samples to backdoor a model. By framing the attack as a Dataset Distillation problem, we develop three CLPBA variants -- Parameter Matching, Gradient Matching, and Feature Matching -- that craft effective poisons under both linear probing and full-finetuning training settings. In hard scenarios that require backdoor generalizability in the physical world, CLPBA is shown to even surpass Dirty-label attack baselines. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLPBA via extensive experiments on two collected physical backdoor datasets for facial recognition and animal classification.

Finally, to compensate for the introduced aggregated quantization and sparsity error, we use a novel saliency function with unique invertible and additive features that enables us to mathematically compute the value of low-rank adapters. SLIM improves model accuracy by up to 5.66% (LLaMA-2-7B) for 2:4 sparsity with 4-bit weight quantization, outperforming prior methods.

Despite its compact design, extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that L3AC matches or exceeds the reconstruction quality of leading codecs while reducing computational overhead by an order of magnitude. The single-quantizer design further enhances its adaptability for downstream tasks. The source code is publicly available atthis https URL."}

This paper bridges artificial intelligence design for children - an emerging field still defining its best practices - and animation, a well established field with decades of experience in engaging children through accessible storytelling. Pairing Piagetian developmental theory with design pattern extraction from 52 works of animation, the paper presents a six scaffold framework that integrates design insights transferable to child centred AI design: (1) signals for visual animacy and clarity, (2) sound for musical and auditory scaffolding, (3) synchrony in audiovisual cues, (4) sidekick style personas, (5) storyplay that supports symbolic play and imaginative exploration, and (6) structure in the form of predictable narratives. These strategies, long refined in animation, function as multimodal scaffolds for attention, understanding, and attunement, supporting learning and comfort. This structured design grammar is transferable to AI design. By reframing cinematic storytelling and child development theory as design logic for AI, the paper offers heuristics for AI that aligns with the cognitive stages and emotional needs of young users. The work contributes to design theory by showing how sensory, affective, and narrative techniques can inform developmentally attuned AI design. Future directions include empirical testing, cultural adaptation, and participatory co design."}

However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes, large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning. Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on two autonomous vehicles and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments.

In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark.

TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics.

We show that modality collapse happens when noisy features from one modality are entangled, via a shared set of neurons in the fusion head, with predictive features from another, effectively masking out positive contributions from the predictive features of the former modality and leading to its collapse. We further prove that cross-modal knowledge distillation implicitly disentangles such representations by freeing up rank bottlenecks in the student encoder, denoising the fusion-head outputs without negatively impacting the predictive features from either modality. Based on the above findings, we propose an algorithm that prevents modality collapse through explicit basis reallocation, with applications in dealing with missing modalities.

To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.

We present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically assigned to generated scenes so that the degree of overlap between input and output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability of the resulting level scenes. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT.

Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail to generalize."}

This scale, coupled with the huge amount of training data, necessitates new storage and training algorithms to efficiently improve the quality of these complex recommendation systems. In this paper, we present a Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) training and modeling paradigm. ROO simultaneously improves the storage and training efficiency as well as the model quality of recommendation systems. We holistically approach this challenge through co-designing data (i.e., request-only data), infrastructure (i.e., request-only based data processing pipeline), and model architecture (i.e., request-only neural architectures). Our ROO training and modeling paradigm treats a user request as a unit of the training data.

While most prior works focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens' perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale, long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural tolerance."}

Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1) fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this potential, directly applying LLMs often results in performance regressions or non-equivalent rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It integrates two core components: a context construction module and a reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks, equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency. Across multiple SQL benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that E3-Rewrite can shorten query execution time by as much as 25.6% relative to leading baselines, while also producing up to 24.4% more rewrites that meet strict equivalence criteria. These gains extend to challenging query patterns that prior approaches could not effectively optimize."}

To resolve this challenge, we propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of replay attacks to just 9.4\\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously generating richer textual content than baseline methods.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this domain by modeling rich structural dependencies in graph-based program representations such as control flow graphs (CFGs). However, single-model approaches may suffer from limited generalization and lack interpretability, especially in high-stakes security applications. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble framework for graph-based malware detection and explanation. Our method dynamically extracts CFGs from portable executable (PE) files and encodes their basic blocks through a two-step embedding strategy. A set of diverse GNN base learners, each with a distinct message-passing mechanism, is used to capture complementary behavioral features. Their prediction outputs are aggregated by a meta-learner implemented as an attention-based multilayer perceptron, which both classifies malware instances and quantifies the contribution of each base model. To enhance explainability, we introduce an ensemble-aware post-hoc explanation technique that leverages edge-level importance scores generated by a GNN explainer and fuses them using the learned attention weights.

However, PTQ often leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to weight fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks. To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers. Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies, actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy. This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves 0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer weights."}

We devise a specialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning problem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for relevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes environmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our benchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as functions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the introduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable. Ideally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by the presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents struggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment feedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct function to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from the environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when the search space is artificially restricted. We provide a systematic analysis of the failures of both open-source and commercial models, examining the effects of search space size, as well as the benefits of scaling model size in our setting. Our analysis identifies key challenges for current generative models as well as promising directions for future work."}

This study proposes a reusable, granular, and topic-agnostic framework to evaluate polarisation-related biases in LLM (both open-source and closed-source). Our approach combines polarisation-sensitive sentiment metrics with a synthetically generated balanced dataset of conflict-related statements, using a predefined set of semantic categories.As a case study, we created a synthetic dataset that focusses on the Russia-Ukraine war, and we evaluated the bias in several LLMs: Llama-3, Mistral, GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.0. Beyond aggregate bias scores, with a general trend for more positive sentiment toward Ukraine, the framework allowed fine-grained analysis with considerable variation between semantic categories, uncovering divergent behavioural patterns among models. Adaptation to prompt modifications showed further bias towards preconceived language and citizenship modification.Overall, the framework supports automated dataset generation and fine-grained bias assessment, is applicable to a variety of polarisation-driven scenarios and topics, and is orthogonal to many other bias-evaluation strategies."}

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns across large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to capture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their diagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of personalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors based on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past question-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that effectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task is challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which often lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based group-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free two-stage framework. In the first stage, we construct a student-specific misconception prototype by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to recover the student's reasoning trajectories from past incorrect answers. In the second stage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new questions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with the student's recurring misconceptions. Experiments show that our approach achieves the best performance in generating plausible, personalized distractors for 140 students, and also effectively generalizes to group-level settings, highlighting its robustness and adaptability."}

Many existing methods treat posts independently and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained textual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed knowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods address this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural associations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and fine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization of textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called HGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and semantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity hypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained passages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared entities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates fine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via hypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which further refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to obtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the LLM.

Our analysis revealed that optimism, fear, and sadness dominated the emotional landscape across all outputs, with neutral sentiment maintaining consistently high values. Gratitude, joy, and trust appeared at moderate levels, while emotions such as anger, disgust, and love were rarely expressed. The choice of LLM significantly influenced emotional expression patterns. Mixtral exhibited the highest levels of negative emotions including disapproval, annoyance, and sadness, while Llama demonstrated the most optimistic and joyful responses. The type of mental health condition dramatically shaped emotional responses: anxiety prompts elicited extraordinarily high fear scores (0.974), depression prompts generated elevated sadness (0.686) and the highest negative sentiment, while stress-related queries produced the most optimistic responses (0.755) with elevated joy and trust. In contrast, demographic framing of queries produced only marginal variations in emotional tone. Statistical analyses confirmed significant model-specific and condition-specific differences, while demographic influences remained minimal.

Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to appear as benign tasks.

We introduce SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal pathways.

We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for predictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the input which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective class. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a new regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and compactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be desirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language processing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and rationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed without training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained classifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high quality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the conditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are more broadly applicable to different input types."}

We first construct value profiles of several open-source LLMs by asking them to rate a series of value-related descriptions spanning 20 distinct human values, which we use as a baseline for subsequent experiments. We then investigate whether the value system of a model can be governed by fine-tuning on the value surveys. We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two ways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey questions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in out-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a contextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate changes in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games.

Our analysis show that models frequently misclassify anti-sexist speech as harmful, particularly during politically charged events where rhetorical styles of harm and resistance converge. These errors risk silencing those who challenge sexism, with disproportionate consequences for marginalised voices. We argue that moderation design must move beyond binary harmful/not-harmful schemas, integrate human-in-the-loop review during sensitive events, and explicitly include counter-speech in training data.

This challenge is particularly pronounced when jointly training a single encoder for Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), two essential but fundamentally disparate tasks for which naive co-training typically yields steep performance trade-offs. We argue that resolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific learning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce CoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR and STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key innovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives paired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances per-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a contrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by cross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly optimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion strategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by analyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization, proving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient, single-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges stably. Extensive experiments on 15 standard IR and STS benchmarks across three base encoders validate CoDiEmb. Our results and analysis demonstrate that the framework not only mitigates cross-task trade-offs but also measurably improves the geometric properties of the embedding space."}

Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms understand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from review text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and expectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are shaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference points. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1 rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a practical alternative to large-scale model deployment."}

Brewster,Thilo Hagendorff", "title": "Speciesism in AI: Evaluating Discrimination Against Animals in Large Language Models", "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become more widely deployed, it is crucial to examine their ethical tendencies. Building on research on fairness and discrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias -- discrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human animals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1) SpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral evaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures comparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation tasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In our benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely condemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On psychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower explicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose to save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that LLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities were equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described as more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In open-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized harm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals. These findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and mainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms around animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment frameworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for reducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes in AI systems and the societies they influence."}

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have sparked growing interest in automated psychological assessment, yet most existing approaches are constrained by their reliance on static text analysis, limiting their ability to capture deeper and more informative insights that emerge through dynamic interaction and iterative questioning. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework for mental health evaluation that simulates clinical doctor-patient dialogues, with specialized agents assigned to questioning, adequacy evaluation, scoring, and updating. We introduce an adaptive questioning mechanism in which an evaluation agent assesses the adequacy of user responses to determine the necessity of generating targeted follow-up queries to address ambiguity and missing information. Additionally, we employ a tree-structured memory in which the root node encodes the user's basic information, while child nodes (e.g., topic and statement) organize key information according to distinct symptom categories and interaction turns. This memory is dynamically updated throughout the interaction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the information extraction and contextual tracking capabilities. Experimental results on the DAIC-WOZ dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves better performance than existing approaches."}

In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Reasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR.

In this work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1 percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of 14 benchmark evaluations.

While public pretrained T2I models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain? Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C, which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The core of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and, critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph, predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target domain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets against three baselines.

To address these issues, this paper presents a novel cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC). Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics, guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical applications."}

To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces the first evolutionary testing framework, ORFuzz, for the systematic detection and analysis of LLM over-refusals. ORFuzz uniquely integrates three core components: (1) safety category-aware seed selection for comprehensive test coverage, (2) adaptive mutator optimization using reasoning LLMs to generate effective test cases, and (3) OR-Judge, a human-aligned judge model validated to accurately reflect user perception of toxicity and refusal. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ORFuzz generates diverse, validated over-refusal instances at a rate (6.98% average) more than double that of leading baselines, effectively uncovering vulnerabilities. Furthermore, ORFuzz's outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly transferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal rate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets.

This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner. Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings (i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features."}

Under limited supervision, large spectral gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks impede effective adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose the HS-GPPT model, a novel framework that ensures spectral alignment throughout both pre-training and prompt-tuning.

Analysis on self-supervised speech models shows that these residuals correlate strongly with duration changes and perform poorly at word identity prediction, indicating a structured, relational encoding of prosodic emphasis. In ASR fine-tuned models, residuals occupy a subspace up to 50% more compact than in pre-trained models, further suggesting that emphasis is encoded as a consistent, low-dimensional transformation that becomes more structured with task-specific learning."}

Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods."}

Evaluating seven LLMs, we find that most models, including GPT-4o, achieve mediocre accuracy on RULEBREAKERS and exhibit some tendency to over-rigidly apply logical rules unlike what is expected from typical human reasoners. Further analysis suggests that this apparent failure is potentially associated with the models' poor utilization of their world knowledge and their attention distribution patterns.

While reinforcement learning (RL) can drive self-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit substantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that Qwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game of Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic properties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to investigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors -- verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that both expert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study reveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama initially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral datasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning behaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding Qwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather than correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primed with incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve comparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally, leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify reasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement trajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial reasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some language models effectively utilize additional computation while others plateau."}

However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM safety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although there are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or manipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra computation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of SLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during the CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation method, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing two modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the magnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the neighboring space near the initial weight distribution. Low-Entropy Masking masks low-entropy tokens, which are regarded as unnecessary learning targets, to exclude them from fine-tuning. Experiments on three SLMs (Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama-3.2-1B, BLOOM-1.1B) across reasoning benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC, AGIEval) and safety evaluation (AdvBench) show that SLowED retains the safety of SLMs and comparably improves their reasoning capability compared to existing distillation methods. Furthermore, our ablation study presents the effectiveness of Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking, with the former maintaining the model's safety in the early stage and the latter prolonging the safe training epochs."}

MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%, and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration processes."}

LLMs can address tasks that they cannot complete independently, thereby enhancing their potential across different tasks. However, this approach faces two key challenges.

In this scenario, tokenizing (i.e., indexing) users and items becomes essential for ensuring a seamless alignment of LLMs with recommendations. While several studies have made progress in representing users and items through textual contents or latent representations, challenges remain in efficiently capturing high-order collaborative knowledge into discrete tokens that are compatible with LLMs. Additionally, the majority of existing tokenization approaches often face difficulties in generalizing effectively to new/unseen users or items that were not in the training corpus. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called TokenRec, which introduces not only an effective ID tokenization strategy but also an efficient retrieval paradigm for LLM-based recommendations. Specifically, our tokenization strategy, Masked Vector-Quantized (MQ) Tokenizer, involves quantizing the masked user/item representations learned from collaborative filtering into discrete tokens, thus achieving a smooth incorporation of high-order collaborative knowledge and a generalizable tokenization of users and items for LLM-based RecSys. Meanwhile, our generative retrieval paradigm is designed to efficiently recommend top-$K$ items for users to eliminate the need for the time-consuming auto-regressive decoding and beam search processes used by LLMs, thus significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating that TokenRec outperforms competitive benchmarks, including both traditional recommender systems and emerging LLM-based recommender systems."}

This sequential approach creates a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input. Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)."}

Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1) fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this potential, directly applying LLMs often results in performance regressions or non-equivalent rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It integrates two core components: a context construction module and a reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks, equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency. Across multiple SQL benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that E3-Rewrite can shorten query execution time by as much as 25.6% relative to leading baselines, while also producing up to 24.4% more rewrites that meet strict equivalence criteria.

We further discuss benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and summarize empirical findings. Finally, we identify existing limitations and propose promising research directions.

Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks.

Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs) have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR, without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on indoor benchmarks.

However, in extreme degradation scenarios (e.g., scale $> 8\\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects. Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \\textbf{Masking} the facial region in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2) \\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style guidance; 3) Leveraging \\textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT) images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID consistency."}

To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency.

In this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques, providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection."}

Our results reveal that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance.

This potential has been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37% on multi-task evaluations."}

With AI, we can now extract detailed measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese (n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns (clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences (classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74. There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of 14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05).

Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion, a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole.

However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a \"free lunch\" manner, leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed, which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in source-free remote sensing detection tasks."}

To address this, we propose IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability, and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025 GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I.

This is a challenging problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module, and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment, the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact. Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead via representative representation replay.

The core of LatHAdapter is to exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process. Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories, attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among categories, learnable attributes, and image samples.

To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios."}

However, existing methods struggle to align with fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

To overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh.

To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising effects with different category conditions to classify categories. Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles, we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good) noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of NoOp."}

When adopting a transformer-based detection model to perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD) to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task, Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation (IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new categories.

Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy, thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations. Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy."}

Subsequently, GRPO fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS), while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R).

A growing body of works have emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However, these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement (CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks."}

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2) lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies. TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e., soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e., sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning. Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications based on TrajSV."}

However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention, which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement."}

Depth maps were first estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles.

Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods."}

In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario, which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and computational operations via executable code. This approach not only facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping, rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations, all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy: an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation, followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20 benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains, particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning tasks."}

We show that this interaction hides a critical safety gap: if harmful content is embedded in a video, either as full-frame inserts or as small corner patches, state-of-the-art VideoLLMs rarely mention the harmful content in the output, despite its clear visibility to human viewers. A root-cause analysis reveals three compounding design flaws: (1) insufficient temporal coverage resulting from the sparse, uniformly spaced frame sampling used by most leading VideoLLMs, (2) spatial information loss introduced by aggressive token downsampling within sampled frames, and (3) encoder-decoder disconnection, whereby visual cues are only weakly utilized during text generation. Leveraging these insights, we craft three zero-query black-box attacks, aligning with these flaws in the processing pipeline. Our large-scale evaluation across five leading VideoLLMs shows that the harmfulness omission rate exceeds 90% in most cases. Even when harmful content is clearly present in all frames, these models consistently fail to identify it. These results underscore a fundamental vulnerability in current VideoLLMs' designs and highlight the urgent need for sampling strategies, token compression, and decoding mechanisms that guarantee semantic coverage rather than speed alone."}

While public pretrained T2I models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain? Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C, which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The core of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and, critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph, predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target domain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets against three baselines.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive and highly accurate imaging modality commonly used by clinicians for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Segmenting uterine fibroids requires a precise assessment of both the uterus and fibroids on MRI scans, including measurements of volume, shape, and spatial location.

Chan", "title": "Fluid Dynamics and Domain Reconstruction from Noisy Flow Images Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Quasi-Conformal Mapping", "abstract": "Blood flow imaging provides important information for hemodynamic behavior within the vascular system and plays an essential role in medical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow images that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or device-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity field, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed noisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem leverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field from noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims to infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping that deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an alternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field and the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality reconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through experiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under varying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic geometry with signal-dependent noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to assess the influence of key hyperparameters."}

ST fusion is a promising approach to address the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite images. In real-world scenarios, observed satellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment and environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on enhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing noise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure, leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces two key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and Temporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization function that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural details, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a nearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally adjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST fusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC, and develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and outperforms them under noisy conditions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive set of recommended parameter values that consistently yield high performance across diverse target regions and noise conditions, aiming to enhance reproducibility and practical utility."}

This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored challenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency for adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training framework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the temporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both objectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in robust-accuracy trade-off.

While replanning is critical for robust autonomy, most existing methods respond only after failures occur, when recovery may be inefficient or infeasible. While proactive replanning holds promise for preventing failures in advance, current solutions often rely on manually designed rules and extensive supervision. In this work, we present a proactive replanning framework that detects and corrects failures at subtask boundaries by comparing scene graphs constructed from current RGB-D observations against reference graphs extracted from successful demonstrations. When the current scene fails to align with reference trajectories, a lightweight reasoning module is activated to diagnose the mismatch and adjust the plan.

Our methodology involves training an ensemble of convolutional neural network models, using online knowledge distillation to transfer insights from the ensemble to its members. This process aims to enhance the performance of each model within the ensemble, thereby elevating the overall performance of the ensemble itself. Post-training, any individual model within the ensemble can be deployed at test time, as each member is trained to deliver comparable performance to the ensemble.

Most previous methods fail to give a complete treatment of these characteristics, and thus are prone to errors. In this paper, we present a simple new criterion for scanpath prediction based on principles from lossy data compression. This criterion suggests minimizing the expected code length of quantized scanpaths in a training set, which corresponds to fitting a discrete conditional probability model via maximum likelihood. Specifically, the probability model is conditioned on two modalities: a viewport sequence as the deformation-reduced visual input and a set of relative historical scanpaths projected onto respective viewports as the aligned path input. The probability model is parameterized by a product of discretized Gaussian mixture models to capture the uncertainty and the diversity of scanpaths from different users. Most importantly, the training of the probability model does not rely on the specification of \"ground-truth\" scanpaths for imitation learning. We also introduce a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller-based sampler to generate realistic human-like scanpaths from the learned probability model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently produces better quantitative scanpath results in terms of prediction accuracy (by comparing to the assumed \"ground-truths\") and perceptual realism (through machine discrimination) over a wide range of prediction horizons.

Moreover, current physical attacks for object detection struggle to achieve both multi-view effectiveness and visual naturalness in navigation scenarios. To address this, we propose a practical attack method for embodied navigation by attaching adversarial patches to objects, where both opacity and textures are learnable. Specifically, to ensure effectiveness across varying viewpoints, we employ a multi-view optimization strategy based on object-aware sampling, which optimizes the patch's texture based on feedback from the vision-based perception model used in navigation. To make the patch inconspicuous to human observers, we introduce a two-stage opacity optimization mechanism, in which opacity is fine-tuned after texture optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our adversarial patches decrease the navigation success rate by an average of 22.39%, outperforming previous methods in practicality, effectiveness, and naturalness.

Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced global modeling through self-attention but suffer from quadratic computational complexity with respect to token count, limiting their efficiency and scalability to high-resolution inputs, especially on mobile and resource-constrained devices. State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, offer an efficient alternative by combining global receptive fields with linear computational complexity, enabling scalable and resource-friendly sequence modeling. However, when applied to dense prediction tasks, existing visual SSMs face key limitations: weak spatial inductive bias, long-range forgetting from hidden state decay, and low-resolution outputs that hinder fine-grained localization. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Visual State Space (DVSS) block, which augments visual state space models with multi-scale convolutional operations to enhance local spatial representations and strengthen spatial inductive biases. Through architectural exploration and theoretical analysis, we incorporate deformable operation into the DVSS block, identifying it as an efficient and effective mechanism to enhance semantic aggregation and mitigate long-range forgetting via input-dependent, adaptive spatial sampling. We embed DVSS into a multi-branch high-resolution architecture to build HRVMamba, a novel model for efficient high-resolution representation learning. Extensive experiments on human pose estimation, image classification, and semantic segmentation show that HRVMamba performs competitively against leading CNN-, ViT-, and SSM-based baselines.

As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts and dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting and preserving.

In this paper, we introduce FairT2I, a novel framework that harnesses large language models to detect and mitigate social biases in T2I generation.

Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.

Brown", "title": "Learning Camera-Agnostic White-Balance Preferences", "abstract": "The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\\sim$500 parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal computational and memory overhead."}

In parallel, the field of human parsing focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel, memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes without relying on texture information.

Furthermore, these methods typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may constrain its performance upper bound.

While recent advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation, head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results, but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian head avatars and support real-time appearance editing."}

In this paper, we propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization, 1$\\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures, leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring, respectively.

In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks. To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers. Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies, actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy. This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines.

The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm (referred to as JMA) provides an optimal solution to a linearised version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. The results of the experiments confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes.

In this paper, we investigated the use of tumor annotations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which are more accessible than annotations in iUS images, for training of deep learning models for iUS brain tumor segmentation. We used 180 annotated MRI scans with corresponding unannotated iUS images, and 29 annotated iUS images. Image registration was performed to transfer the MRI annotations to the corresponding iUS images before training the nnU-Net model with different configurations of the data and label origins. The results showed no significant difference in Dice score for a model trained with only MRI annotated tumors compared to models trained with only iUS annotations and both, and to expert annotations, indicating that MRI tumor annotations can be used as a substitute for iUS tumor annotations to train a deep learning model for automatic brain tumor segmentation in iUS images. The best model obtained an average Dice score of $0.62\\pm0.31$, compared to $0.67\\pm0.25$ for an expert neurosurgeon, where the performance on larger tumors were similar, but lower for the models on smaller tumors.

Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs.

Extensive experiments under two degradation methods on several benchmarks, including AID, UCMerced, and RSSRD-QH, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.09 dB in PSNR, while using only 63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 3.2 times faster."}

Leveraging a Gaussian-equivalence principle, we solve the full-batch gradient-flow dynamics of linear and convolutional denoisers and integrate the resulting probability-flow ODE, yielding analytic expressions for the generated distribution. The theory exposes a universal inverse-variance spectral law: the time for an eigen- or Fourier mode to match its target variance scales as $\\tau\\propto\\lambda^{-1}$, so high-variance (coarse) structure is mastered orders of magnitude sooner than low-variance (fine) detail. Extending the analysis to deep linear networks and circulant full-width convolutions shows that weight sharing merely multiplies learning rates accelerating but not eliminating the bias whereas local convolution introduces a qualitatively different bias. Experiments on Gaussian and natural-image datasets confirm the spectral law persists in deep MLP-based UNet. Convolutional U-Nets, however, display rapid near-simultaneous emergence of many modes, implicating local convolution in reshaping learning dynamics.

While deep learning methods have shown promise in aiding OVCFs screening, they often lack interpretability and sufficient sensitivity, limiting their clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel vertebra synthesis-height loss quantification-OVCFs grading framework. Our proposed model, HealthiVert-GAN, utilizes a coarse-to-fine synthesis network designed to generate pseudo-healthy vertebral images that simulate the pre-fracture state of fractured vertebrae. This model integrates three auxiliary modules that leverage the morphology and height information of adjacent healthy vertebrae to ensure anatomical consistency. Additionally, we introduce the Relative Height Loss of Vertebrae (RHLV) as a quantification metric, which divides each vertebra into three sections to measure height loss between pre-fracture and post-fracture states, followed by fracture severity classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on both the Verse2019 dataset and in-house dataset, and it provides cross-sectional distribution maps of vertebral height loss.

In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited preservation of fine structural details.

We further prove that cross-modal knowledge distillation implicitly disentangles such representations by freeing up rank bottlenecks in the student encoder, denoising the fusion-head outputs without negatively impacting the predictive features from either modality. Based on the above findings, we propose an algorithm that prevents modality collapse through explicit basis reallocation, with applications in dealing with missing modalities.

This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU), i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences. This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods."}

To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance.

The core of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and, critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph, predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target domain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets against three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model for the rest."}

However, in prior RLVR pipelines, the repeated use of static initial-state sampling drawn exactly from the dataset distribution during each sampling phase produced overly deterministic, low diversity model behavior, which manifested as rapid entropy collapse and hindered sustained performance gains during prolonged training. To address this issue, we introduce CURE (Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention), a two-stage framework that balances exploration and exploitation. Specifically, in the first stage, to deliberately steer the model toward novel yet coherent contexts, we re-generate at high-entropy critical tokens and jointly optimize the original and the branched trajectories. The further comparison with vanilla DAPO shows that the regeneration process achieves a better performance on math reasoning tasks while sustaining a high-level entropy degree for exploration. In the second stage, we continue training with static initial-state sampling by DAPO, intentionally placing the model in a familiar state to gradually strengthen exploitation. Extensive experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B show that, compared to other RLVR methods, CURE achieves a 5% performance gain across six math benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and accuracy. A series of experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available atthis https URL."}

However, current methods are often computationally expensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model before calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the prediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by introducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval predictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs prediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty sets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors can be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can apply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we focus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression tasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification settings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible classes. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for detecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical experiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than interval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while achieving a similar coverage over the test data."}

For instance, several asylum and refugee resettlement programs now use ML-based employment predictions to guide where newly arriving families are placed within a host country, which requires generating informative and differentiated predictions for many and often small source locations. However, this task is made challenging by several common characteristics of the data in these settings: the presence of numerous distinct data sources, distributional shifts between them, and substantial variation in sample sizes across sources.

However, due to the parameter explosion and data sparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order feature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the occurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning distributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in word embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional representations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different features through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which then serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new test samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence Bayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e., NeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn distributional representations of feature values and parameterize the conditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic gradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model efficiently. Extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets demonstrate that the proposed NeuralKDB classifier excels in capturing high-order feature dependencies and significantly outperforms the conventional Bayesian network classifiers, as well as other competitive classifiers, including two neural network based classifiers without distributional representation learning."}

This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner. Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings (i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features."}

In this work, we revisit the adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling, treating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete timesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored challenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency for adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training framework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the temporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both objectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in robust-accuracy trade-off. Additional analyses reveal that RTE reshapes the internal robustness landscape of SNNs, leading to more resilient and temporally diversified decision boundaries. Our study highlights the importance of temporal structure in adversarial learning and offers a principled foundation for building robust spiking models."}

This under coverage is particularly concerning, as it undermines the reliability of the prediction sets for minority classes, even with coverage ensured on average.

The emerging modularizing-while-training (MwT) paradigm, which incorporates modularization into training, outperforms modularizing-after-training approaches. However, existing MwT methods focus on small-scale CNN models at the convolutional kernel level and struggle with diverse DNNs and large-scale models, particularly Transformer-based models.

Gradient-based DFL requires computing the derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the predicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear programs (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted parameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches for LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP into a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer and then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that have informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former approach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the regret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address this, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable optimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our experiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable optimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than surrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds for DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs, that computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can be performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes the forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate losses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the state-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin."}

Central to TDL is the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic graph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models for learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using Forman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic based on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of a graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph geometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably represented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across large distances in the network.

We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert tokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient learning process.

To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory COgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC) to learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD (Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals.

We call an explanation informative if it serves to reduce the complexity of the space of plausible decision functions. With this approach, we show that many popular explanation algorithms are not informative when applied to complex decision functions, providing a rigorous mathematical rejection of the idea that it should be possible to explain any model. We then derive conditions under which different explanation algorithms become informative. These are often stronger than what one might expect.

While critical testing scenario generation has emerged as an appealing verification methodology, effectively balancing diversity and criticality remains a key challenge for existing methods, particularly due to local optima entrapment in high-dimensional scenario spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-space guided testing framework that coordinates scenario parameter space and agent behavior space, aiming to generate testing scenarios considering diversity and criticality. Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchical representation framework combines dimensionality reduction and multi-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse and critical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generation modes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenario quantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space, agent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioral criticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forming a closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization and exploration within the parameter space. Experiments show our framework improves critical scenario generation by an average of 56.23\\% and demonstrates greater diversity under novel parameter-behavior co-driven metrics when tested on five decision-making agents, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines."}

CCS projects are often implemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features such as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive behavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located in geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon extraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing infrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and unrealistic.In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively investigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of stakeholders.

In this paper, we propose a heterogeneity weighted U (HWU) method for association analyses considering genetic heterogeneity. HWU can be applied to various types of phenotypes (e.g., binary and continuous) and is computationally effcient for high- dimensional genetic data. Through simulations, we showed the advantage of HWU when the underlying genetic etiology of a disease was heterogeneous, as well as the robustness of HWU against different model assumptions (e.g., phenotype distributions).

Converging evidence shows that genetic variants with low marginal effects (LME) play an important role in disease development. Despite their potential significance, discovering LME genetic variants and assessing their joint association on high dimensional data (e.g., genome wide association studies) remain a great challenge. To facilitate joint association analysis among a large ensemble of LME genetic variants, we proposed a computationally efficient and powerful approach, which we call Trees Assembling Mann whitney (TAMW). Through simulation studies and an empirical data application, we found that TAMW outperformed multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and the likelihood ratio based Mann whitney approach (LRMW) when the underlying complex disease involves multiple LME loci and their interactions. For instance, in a simulation with 20 interacting LME loci, TAMW attained a higher power (power=0.931) than both MDR (power=0.599) and LRMW (power=0.704). In an empirical study of 29 known Crohn's disease (CD) loci, TAMW also identified a stronger joint association with CD than those detected by MDR and LRMW. Finally, we applied TAMW to Wellcome Trust CD GWAS to conduct a genome wide analysis. The analysis of 459K single nucleotide polymorphisms was completed in 40 hours using parallel computing, and revealed a joint association predisposing to CD (p-value=2.763e-19).

This can be attributed to its scalability and ease of training compared to other diffusion model paradigms for discrete data, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive generator for discrete data. Diffusion models, in general, have shown excellent ability to improve the generation quality by leveraging inference-time scaling either by increasing the number of denoising steps or by using external verifiers on top of the outputs of each step to guide the generation. In this work, we propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling method that aids in finding a better candidate generation during the denoising process of the MDM. Our experiments demonstrate the application of MDMs for standard text-style transfer tasks and establish MDMs as a better alternative to autoregressive language models. Additionally, we show that a simple soft-value-based verifier setup for MDMs using off-the-shelf pre-trained embedding models leads to significant gains in generation quality even when used on top of typical classifier-free guidance setups in the existing literature."}

Challenges remain in finding additional unknown genetic variants predisposing to complex diseases. With the advance in next-generation sequencing technologies, sequencing studies have become commonplace in genetic research. The ongoing exome-sequencing and whole-genome-sequencing studies generate a massive amount of sequencing variants and allow researchers to comprehensively investigate their role in human diseases. The discovery of new disease-associated variants can be enhanced by utilizing powerful and computationally efficient statistical methods. In this paper, we propose a functional analysis of variance (FANOVA) method for testing an association of sequence variants in a genomic region with a qualitative trait. The FANOVA has a number of advantages: (1) it tests for a joint effect of gene variants, including both common and rare; (2) it fully utilizes linkage disequilibrium and genetic position information; and (3) allows for either protective or risk-increasing causal variants. Through simulations, we show that FANOVA outperform two popularly used methods - SKAT and a previously proposed method based on functional linear models (FLM), - especially if a sample size of a study is small and/or sequence variants have low to moderate effects. We conduct an empirical study by applying three methods (FANOVA, SKAT and FLM) to sequencing data from Dallas Heart Study.

To achieve this, experience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally expensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts have been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most time-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on theory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and integrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to automatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning time. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by learning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we integrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed for LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability issue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy network, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based on objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in this study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves the effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively.

Many existing methods treat posts independently and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

In particular, we highlight the benefits of using orthogonal polynomial bases-such as Legendre polynomials-in sparse regression frameworks, demonstrating their advantages in stability, convergence, and hierarchical interpretability compared to standard polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that our models achieve significantly lower root-mean squared losses than the widely used sixth-degree polynomial benchmark-while using the same or fewer parameters.

In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15 METH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power (RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31 channels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed.

The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is lower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be validated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the TP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when receiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to METH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and HC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS.

Due to the lack of fine-grained behavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies within user behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high false positive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal and anomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behavior sequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels (anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, to enhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learning discriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called Robust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres to represent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifier is constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point. Building on this, using multiple instance learning and adaptive behavior-level self-training debiasing based on model prediction confidence, the framework further refines hyper-spheres and feature representations using weak sequence-level labels. This approach enhances the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors.

Unlike traditional parametric approaches, which assume a known functional form for the drift, our goal here is to learn the entire drift function directly from data without strong structural assumptions, making it especially relevant in scientific disciplines where system dynamics are partially understood or highly complex. We cast the estimation problem as minimization of the penalized negative log-likelihood functional over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In the sparse observation regime, the presence of unobserved trajectory segments makes the SDE likelihood intractable. To address this, we develop an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that employs a novel Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method to approximate the filtering distribution and generate Monte Carlo estimates of the E-step objective. The M-step then reduces to a penalized empirical risk minimization problem in the RKHS, whose minimizer is given by a finite linear combination of kernel functions via a generalized representer theorem. To control model complexity across EM iterations, we also develop a hybrid Bayesian variant of the algorithm that uses shrinkage priors to identify significant coefficients in the kernel expansion. We establish important theoretical convergence results for both the exact and approximate EM sequences. The resulting EM-SMC-RKHS procedure enables accurate estimation of the drift function of stochastic dynamical systems in low-data regimes and is broadly applicable across domains requiring continuous-time modeling under observational constraints.

Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding.

Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \\textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains.

The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem.

Knowing the recourse, however, does not guarantee that users can implement it perfectly, either due to environmental variability or personal choices. Recourse generation should thus anticipate its sub-optimal or noisy implementation. While several approaches construct recourse that is robust to small perturbations -- e.g., arising due to its noisy implementation -- they assume that the entire recourse is implemented in a single step, thus model the noise as one-off and uniform. But these assumptions are unrealistic since recourse often entails multiple sequential steps, which makes it harder to implement and subject to increasing noise. In this work, we consider recourse under plausible noise that adheres to the local data geometry and accumulates at every step of the way. We frame this problem as a Markov Decision Process and demonstrate that such a distribution of plausible noise satisfies the Markov property. We then propose the RObust SEquential (ROSE) recourse generator for tabular data; our method produces a series of steps leading to the desired outcome even when they are implemented imperfectly. Given plausible modelling of sub-optimal human actions and greater recourse robustness to accumulated uncertainty, ROSE provides users with a high chance of success while maintaining low recourse cost.

Traditional sketches provide only coarse estimates under strict memory constraints. Although some learning-augmented methods have emerged recently, they typically rely on offline training with real frequencies or/and labels, which are often unavailable. Moreover, these methods suffer from slow update speeds, limiting their suitability for real-time processing despite offering only marginal accuracy improvements. To overcome these challenges, we propose UCL-sketch, a practical learning-based paradigm for per-key frequency estimation. Our design introduces two key innovations: (i) an online training mechanism based on equivalent learning that requires no ground truth (GT), and (ii) a highly scalable architecture leveraging logically structured estimation buckets to scale to real-world data stream. The UCL-sketch, which utilizes compressive sensing (CS), converges to an estimator that provably yields a error bound far lower than that of prior works, without sacrificing the speed of processing. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previously proposed approaches regarding per-key accuracy and distribution. Notably, under extremely tight memory budgets, its quality almost matches that of an (infeasible) omniscient oracle. Moreover, compared to the existing equation-based sketch, UCL-sketch achieves an average decoding speedup of nearly 500 times.

These assignment algorithms consider two main factors: (1) reviewers' expressed interests indicated by their bids for papers, and (2) reviewers' domain expertise inferred from the similarity between the text of their previously published papers and the submitted manuscripts. A significant challenge these conferences face is the existence of collusion rings, where groups of researchers manipulate the assignment process to review each other's papers, providing positive evaluations regardless of their actual quality. Most efforts to combat collusion rings have focused on preventing bid manipulation, under the assumption that the text similarity component is secure. In this paper, we demonstrate that even in the absence of bidding, colluding reviewers and authors can exploit the machine learning based text-matching component of reviewer assignment used at top ML/AI venues to get assigned their target paper.

Leveraging a Gaussian-equivalence principle, we solve the full-batch gradient-flow dynamics of linear and convolutional denoisers and integrate the resulting probability-flow ODE, yielding analytic expressions for the generated distribution. The theory exposes a universal inverse-variance spectral law: the time for an eigen- or Fourier mode to match its target variance scales as $\\tau\\propto\\lambda^{-1}$, so high-variance (coarse) structure is mastered orders of magnitude sooner than low-variance (fine) detail. Extending the analysis to deep linear networks and circulant full-width convolutions shows that weight sharing merely multiplies learning rates accelerating but not eliminating the bias whereas local convolution introduces a qualitatively different bias. Experiments on Gaussian and natural-image datasets confirm the spectral law persists in deep MLP-based UNet. Convolutional U-Nets, however, display rapid near-simultaneous emergence of many modes, implicating local convolution in reshaping learning dynamics.

Our method is uniquely simple, requiring no alterations to the loss function, network architecture, or post-selection retraining. The layer is mathematically elegant and can be fully described by: \\begin{align} \\nonumber \\tilde{x}_i = a_i x_i + (1-a_i)z_i \\end{align} where $x_i$ is the input feature, $\\tilde{x}_i$ the output, $z_i$ a Gaussian noise, and $a_i$ trainable gain such that $\\sum_i{a_i^2}=k$.

This sequential approach creates a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input. Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces over-refusals.

This necessitates continued access to the original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and storage constraints.

Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning - without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns, enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based conditioning in diffusion models."}

D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch, the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many potentially \"important\" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement when using D-Wave-based sampling.

This visual-to-neural mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability.

Special attention is required in settings where the model generation process involves hyperparameter tuning, i.e. data-driven optimization of different types of hyperparameters to improve the predictive performance of the resulting model. Discussions about tuning typically focus on the hyperparameters of the ML algorithm (e.g., the minimum number of observations in each terminal node for a tree-based algorithm). In this context, it is often neglected that hyperparameters also exist for the preprocessing steps that are applied to the data before it is provided to the algorithm (e.g., how to handle missing feature values in the data). As a consequence, users experimenting with different preprocessing options to improve model performance may be unaware that this constitutes a form of hyperparameter tuning, albeit informal and unsystematic, and thus may fail to report or account for this optimization. To illuminate this issue, this paper reviews and empirically illustrates different procedures for generating and evaluating prediction models, explicitly addressing the different ways algorithm and preprocessing hyperparameters are typically handled by applied ML users.

Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs.

While reinforcement learning (RL) can drive self-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit substantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that Qwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game of Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic properties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to investigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors -- verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that both expert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study reveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama initially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral datasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning behaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding Qwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather than correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primed with incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve comparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally, leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify reasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement trajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial reasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some language models effectively utilize additional computation while others plateau."}

Conventional approaches that rely on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) require nontrivial gradient computations and are prone to local optima. To overcome these limitations, a sample-efficient global optimization method based on Bayesian optimization (BO) is proposed, using an ensemble Gaussian process (EGP) surrogate with weighted kernels from a predefined dictionary. This ensemble enables a richer function space and improves robustness over single-kernel BO. Each objective evaluation is efficiently performed via Kalman filter recursion. Extensive experiments across parameter settings and sampling intervals show that the EGP-based BO consistently outperforms MLE via steady-state filtering and expectation-maximization (whose derivation is a side contribution) in terms of RMSE and statistical consistency. Unlike the ensemble variant, single-kernel BO does not always yield such gains, underscoring the benefits of model averaging. Notably, the BO-based estimator achieves RMSE below the classical Cramer-Rao bound, particularly for the inverse time constant, long considered difficult to estimate.

Specifically, we introduce physics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the echo state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic systems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo state network models in learning the target chaotic systems.

We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance."}

However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition."}

However, the high computational cost, which scales cubically with the number of collocation points, remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for large-scale or high-dimensional problems.

This often fails to fully capture user intent and makes it difficult to identify suitable models when developers also consider factors such as bias mitigation, hardware requirements, or license compliance. To address the limitations of keyword-based model search, we propose PTMPicker to accurately identify suitable PTMs. We first define a structured template composed of common and essential attributes for PTMs and then PTMPicker represents both candidate models and user-intended features (i.e., model search requests) in this unified format. To determine whether candidate models satisfy user requirements, it computes embedding similarities for function-related attributes and uses well-crafted prompts to evaluate special constraints such as license compliance and hardware requirements. We scraped a total of 543,949 pretrained models from Hugging Face to prepare valid candidates for selection. PTMPicker then represented them in the predefined structured format by extracting their associated descriptions. Guided by the extracted metadata, we synthesized a total of 15,207 model search requests with carefully designed prompts, as no such search requests are readily available. Experiments on the curated PTM dataset and the synthesized model search requests show that PTMPicker can help users effectively identify models,with 85% of the sampled requests successfully locating appropriate PTMs within the top-10 ranked candidates."}

Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each featuring one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and corresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues unrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect conclusions.To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand augmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that preserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details.

Additionally, the impact of prompt styles on LLM performance for SE tasks within a historical context remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose HAFix, which stands for History-Augmented LLMs on Bug Fixing, a novel approach that leverages seven individual historical heuristics associated with bugs and aggregates the results of these heuristics (HAFix-Agg) to enhance LLMs' bug-fixing capabilities. To empirically evaluate HAFix, we employ three Code LLMs (i.e., Code Llama, DeepSeek-Coder and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite models) on 51 single-line Python bugs from BugsInPy and 116 single-line Java bugs from Defects4J. Our evaluation demonstrates that multiple HAFix heuristics achieve statistically significant improvements compared to a non-historical baseline inspired by GitHub Copilot. Furthermore, the aggregated HAFix variant HAFix-Agg achieves substantial improvements by combining the complementary strengths of individual heuristics, increasing bug-fixing rates by an average of 45.05% on BugsInPy and 49.92% on Defects4J relative to the corresponding baseline. Moreover, within the context of historical heuristics, we identify the Instruction prompt style as the most effective template compared to the InstructionLabel and InstructionMask for LLMs in bug fixing. Finally, we evaluate the cost of HAFix in terms of inference time and token usage, and provide a pragmatic trade-off analysis of the cost and bug-fixing performance, offering valuable insights for the practical deployment of our approach in real-world scenarios."}

This shift marks the emergence of Human-AI Experience in Integrated Development Environment (in-IDE HAX), a field that explores the evolving dynamics of Human-Computer Interaction in AI-assisted coding environments. Despite rapid adoption, research on in-IDE HAX remains fragmented, which highlights the need for a unified overview of current practices, challenges, and opportunities. To provide a structured overview of existing research, we conduct a systematic literature review of 90 studies, summarizing current findings and outlining areas for further investigation.We organize key insights from reviewed studies into three aspects: Impact, Design, and Quality of AI-based systems inside IDEs. Impact findings show that AI-assisted coding enhances developer productivity but also introduces challenges, such as verification overhead and over-reliance. Design studies show that effective interfaces surface context, provide explanations and transparency of suggestion, and support user control. Quality studies document risks in correctness, maintainability, and security. For future research, priorities include productivity studies, design of assistance, and audit of AI-generated code. The agenda calls for larger and longer evaluations, stronger audit and verification assets, broader coverage across the software life cycle, and adaptive assistance under user control."}

However, these models require significant computational resources for training and fine-tuning, posing challenges for real-world adoption in resource-constrained environments. To address this, the research community has increasingly turned to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)-a class of techniques that enables the adaptation of large models by updating only a small subset of parameters, rather than the entire model. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we examine the growing application of PEFT techniques-across a wide range of software engineering tasks. We analyze how these methods are used to optimize various deep learning (DL) architectures, focusing on their impact on both performance and efficiency. Our study synthesizes findings from 28 peer-reviewed papers, identifying patterns in configuration strategies and adaptation trade-offs. The outcome of this review is a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes PEFT usage by task type, distinguishing between generative (e.g., Code Summarization) and non-generative (e.g., Code Clone Detection) scenarios. Our findings aim to inform future research and guide the practical deployment of PEFT in sustainable, AI-powered software development. Our artifacts are publicly available atthis https URL"}

We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance."}

However, developing and understanding scientific workflows remains challenging for many domain scientists due to the complexity of tool/module selection, infrastructure requirements, and limited programming expertise. This study explores whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and DeepSeek-V3 can assist in generating accurate, complete, and usable bioinformatics workflows. We evaluate a set of representative workflows covering tasks such as RNA-seq, SNP analysis, and DNA methylation across both Galaxy (graphical) and Nextflow (script-based) platforms. To simulate realistic usage, we adopt a tiered prompting strategy: each workflow is first generated using an instruction-only prompt; if the output is incomplete or incorrect, we escalate to a role-based prompt, and finally to chain-of-thought prompting if needed. The generated workflows are evaluated against community-curated baselines from the Galaxy Training Network and nf-core, using criteria including correctness, completeness, tool appropriateness, and executability. Results show that LLMs exhibit strong potential in workflow development. Gemini 2.5 Flash produced the most accurate and user-friendly workflows in Galaxy, while DeepSeek-V3 excelled in Nextflow pipeline generation. GPT-4o performed nicely with structured prompts. Prompting strategy significantly influenced output quality, with role-based and chain-of-thought prompts enhancing correctness and completeness. Overall, LLMs can reduce the cognitive and technical barriers to workflow development, making SWSs more accessible to novice and expert users. This work highlights the practical utility of LLMs and provides actionable insights for integrating them into real-world bioinformatics workflow design."}

Nevertheless, existing work reveals a significant gap in the CVEs whose patches exist but are not traceable. Existing works have proposed several approaches to trace/retrieve the patching commit for fixing a CVE. However, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) They cannot effectively handle long diff code of a commit; (2) We are not aware of existing work that scales to the full repository with satisfactory accuracy. Upon identifying this gap, we propose SITPatchTracer, a scalable and effective retrieval system for tracing known vulnerability patches. To handle the context length challenge, SITPatchTracer proposes a novel hierarchical embedding technique which efficiently extends the context coverage to 6x that of existing work while covering all files in the commit. To handle the scalability challenge, SITPatchTracer utilizes a three-phase framework, balancing the effectiveness/efficiency in each phase.The evaluation of SITPatchTracer demonstrates it outperforms existing patch tracing methods (PatchFinder, PatchScout, VFCFinder) by a large margin. Furthermore, SITPatchTracer outperforms VoyageAI, the SOTA commercial code embedding LLM (\\$1.8 per 10K commits) on the MRR and Recall@10 by 18\\% and 28\\% on our two datasets. Using SITPatchTracer, we have successfully traced and merged the patch links for 35 new CVEs in the GitHub Advisory database Our ablation study reveals that hierarchical embedding is a practically effective way of handling long context for patch retrieval."}

However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project atthis https URL."}

Drawing upon our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations, generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health outcomes."}
