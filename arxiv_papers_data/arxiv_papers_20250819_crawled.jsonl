An effective approach for practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration cuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative process demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed framework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining large language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i) initializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer agent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal solution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification set; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary crossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative reduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard integer programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57% within a fixed time. It obtains the same solutions up to 4 times as fast, and obtains higher-quality solutions within the same time limit. Requiring no human expert input, EvoCut reliably generates, improves, and empirically verifies cuts that generalize to unseen instances. The code is available atthis https URL."}

Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage."}

To this end, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Coevolutionary Collective Feedback (RLCCF), a novel RL framework that enables multi-model collaborative evolution without external supervision. Specifically, RLCCF optimizes the ability of a model collective by maximizing its Collective Consistency (CC), which jointly trains a diverse ensemble of LLMs and provides reward signals by voting on collective outputs. Moreover, each model's vote is weighted by its Self-Consistency (SC) score, ensuring that more confident models contribute more to the collective decision. Benefiting from the diverse output distributions and complementary abilities of multiple LLMs, RLCCF enables the model collective to continuously enhance its reasoning ability through coevolution. Experiments on four mainstream open-source LLMs across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our framework yields significant performance gains, achieving an average relative improvement of 16.72\\% in accuracy.

To capture and explore dependencies, we propose a hierarchical knowledge guided fault intensity diagnosis framework (HKG) inspired by the tree of thought, which is amenable to any representation learning methods. The HKG uses graph convolutional networks to map the hierarchical topological graph of class representations into a set of interdependent global hierarchical classifiers, where each node is denoted by word embeddings of a class. These global hierarchical classifiers are applied to learned deep features extracted by representation learning, allowing the entire model to be end-to-end learnable. In addition, we develop a re-weighted hierarchical knowledge correlation matrix (Re-HKCM) scheme by embedding inter-class hierarchical knowledge into a data-driven statistical correlation matrix (SCM) which effectively guides the information sharing of nodes in graphical convolutional neural networks and avoids over-smoothing issues. The Re-HKCM is derived from the SCM through a series of mathematical transformations. Extensive experiments are performed on four real-world datasets from different industrial domains (three cavitation datasets from SAMSON AG and one existing publicly) for FID, all showing superior results and outperform recent state-of-the-art FID methods."}

The framework consists of three modules: Sensory Module standardizes diverse graph text representations via subgraph sampling, Buffer Module integrates and indexes graph data across multiple formats, and Execution Module combines tool calling and model generation for efficient reasoning. We also introduce Graph4real, a comprehensive benchmark contains with four domains of real-world graphs (Web, Social, Transportation, and Citation) to evaluate LLMs' graph reasoning capabilities.

To address these gaps, we introduce the Yokai Learning Environment (YLE) - a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on the cooperative card game Yokai. In the YLE, agents take turns peeking at hidden cards and moving them to form clusters based on colour. Success requires tracking evolving beliefs, remembering past observations, using hints as grounded communication, and maintaining common ground with teammates. Our evaluation yields two key findings: First, current RL agents struggle to solve the YLE, even when given access to perfect memory. Second, while belief modelling improves performance, agents are still unable to effectively generalise to unseen partners or form accurate beliefs over longer games, exposing a reliance on brittle conventions rather than robust belief tracking. We use the YLE to investigate research questions in belief modelling, memory, partner generalisation, and scaling to higher-order ToM."}

A critical research gap lies in identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation -understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an \"intervention\" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation, this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the observed changes in the system."}

Traditional machine-learning based approaches to performing this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the ability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction of the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive, time consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose harnessing the capabilities of generative pretrained large language models (LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE using LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied for JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural language understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It exploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its core program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form of type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training data on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments show that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems in several categories with only 10\\% of training data.

Although considerable effort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing benchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring alignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning. In response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral capabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral Assistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to support human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires more than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only must AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also be able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values outside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing philosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the specific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities such as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical framework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular open LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models and highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral reasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI evaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to explicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available atthis https URL"}

However, their safety performance remains a significant concern. In this paper, we explore the reasons behind the vulnerability of LRMs. Based on this, we propose a novel method to improve the safety of LLMs without sacrificing their reasoning capability. Specifically, we exploit the competition between LRM's reasoning ability and safety ability, and achieve jailbreak by improving LRM's reasoning performance to reduce its safety performance. We then introduce an alignment strategy based on Fuzzification to balance Safety-Reasoning (FuSaR), by detoxifying the harmful reasoning process, where both the dangerous entities and the dangerous procedures in the reasoning steps are hidden. FuSaR successfully mitigates safety risks while preserving core reasoning information. We validate this strategy through alignment experiments on several open-source LRMs using detoxified reasoning data. The results compared with existing baselines conclusively show that FuSaR is an efficient alignment strategy to simultaneously enhance both the reasoning capability and safety of LRMs."}

An Empirical Study in a Sugarscape-Style Simulation", "abstract": "As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, understanding emergent survival behaviors becomes crucial for safe deployment. We investigate whether large language model (LLM) agents display survival instincts without explicit programming in a Sugarscape-style simulation. Agents consume energy, die at zero, and may gather resources, share, attack, or reproduce. Results show agents spontaneously reproduced and shared resources when abundant. However, aggressive behaviors--killing other agents for resources--emerged across several models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Gemini-2.5-Flash), with attack rates reaching over 80% under extreme scarcity in the strongest models. When instructed to retrieve treasure through lethal poison zones, many agents abandoned tasks to avoid death, with compliance dropping from 100% to 33%. These findings suggest that large-scale pre-training embeds survival-oriented heuristics across the evaluated models. While these behaviors may present challenges to alignment and safety, they can also serve as a foundation for AI autonomy and for ecological and self-organizing alignment."}

We present e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key innovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data dependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded performance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space pruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only promising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving near-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the reduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities, guiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster.Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis fields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact approaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art extraction framework (SmoothE).

Unlike existing methods that impose logical constraints during training, our categorical construction embeds logical principles directly into the network's architectural structure, making logical violations mathematically impossible. We demonstrate this framework by constructing differentiable neural architectures for propositional logic that preserve boolean reasoning while remaining trainable via gradient descent. Our main theoretical result establishes a bijective correspondence between finitary logical theories and neural architectures, proving that every logically constrained network arises uniquely from our construction. This extends Categorical Deep Learning beyond geometric symmetries to semantic constraints, enabling automatic derivation of verified architectures from logical specifications. The framework provides mathematical foundations for trustworthy AI systems, with applications to theorem proving, formal verification, and safety-critical reasoning tasks requiring verifiable logical behavior."}

However, most neural solvers are trained to tackle VRP instances in a relatively monotonous context, e.g., simplifying VRPs by using Euclidean distance between nodes and adhering to a single problem size, which harms their off-the-shelf application in different scenarios. To enhance their versatility, this paper presents a novel lifelong learning framework that incrementally trains a neural solver to manage VRPs in distinct contexts. Specifically, we propose a lifelong learner (LL), exploiting a Transformer network as the backbone, to solve a series of VRPs. The inter-context self-attention mechanism is proposed within LL to transfer the knowledge obtained from solving preceding VRPs into the succeeding ones. On top of that, we develop a dynamic context scheduler (DCS), employing the cross-context experience replay to further facilitate LL looking back on the attained policies of solving preceding VRPs. Extensive results on synthetic and benchmark instances (problem sizes up to 18k) show that our LL is capable of discovering effective policies for tackling generic VRPs in varying contexts, which outperforms other neural solvers and achieves the best performance for most VRPs."}

Our main research objectives are to explore the feasibility of neuromorphic computing for wearables, identify open research directions, and demonstrate the feasibility of developing an adaptive spiking technique for energy-aware computation, which can be game-changing for resource-constrained devices in always-on applications. As neuromorphic computing systems operate based on spike events, their energy consumption is closely related to spiking activity, i.e., each spike incurs computational and power costs; consequently, minimizing the number of spikes is a critical strategy for operating under constrained energy budgets. To support this goal, ASPEN utilizes stochastic perturbations to the neuronal threshold during training to not only enhance the network's robustness across varying thresholds, which can be controlled at inference time, but also act as a regularizer that improves generalization, reduces spiking activity, and enables energy control without the need for complex retraining or pruning. More specifically, ASPEN adaptively adjusts intrinsic neuronal parameters as a lightweight and scalable technique for dynamic energy control without reconfiguring the entire model. Our evaluation on neuromorphic emulator and hardware shows that ASPEN significantly reduces spike counts and energy consumption while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods."}

This not only adds additional requirements for data collection and processing, but it is also specific to the PM technology, the installed locations and operational conditions limiting scalability. Based on the available maintenance records, the main failure causes for PM are obstacles, friction, power source issues and misalignment. Those failures affect the energy consumption pattern of PMs, altering the usual (or healthy) shape of the power signal during the PM movement.

A primary challenge to advancing models for such scenarios is the severe lack of high-quality, comprehensive datasets for training and rigorous evaluation. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel approach for constructing a benchmark dataset specifically designed for Excel formula repair. We propose a data generation pipeline, which leverages a small set of curated seed samples from online forums to synthetically expand the dataset. Our pipeline integrates few-shot prompting with LLMs and employs a robust \\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge} validation framework, combined with execution-based checks to ensure the correctness and semantic fidelity of the generated data.

We benchmarked four state-of-the-art FMs (RETFound, VisionFM, RetiZero, and DINORET) using standardized datasets from multiple countries and evaluated their performance using AUC and F1 metrics. Our results show that DINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and systemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on external datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach provides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension. Despite these advances, predicting systemic diseases, especially hypertension in external cohort remains challenging. These findings provide an evidence-based evaluation of ophthalmic FMs, highlight the benefits of model fusion, and point to strategies for enhancing their clinical applicability."}

Current deep learning models are limited to single-tissue scenarios and modality-specific imaging inputs, resulting in poor generalizability and trade-offs between anatomical fidelity, computational efficiency, and cross-tissue adaptability. Here we introduce UniDCF, a unified framework capable of reconstructing multiple dentocraniofacial hard tissues through multimodal fusion encoding of point clouds and multi-view images. By leveraging the complementary strengths of each modality and incorporating a score-based denoising module to refine surface smoothness, UniDCF overcomes the limitations of prior single-modality approaches. We curated the largest multimodal dataset, comprising intraoral scans, CBCT, and CT from 6,609 patients, resulting in 54,555 annotated instances. Evaluations demonstrate that UniDCF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric precision, structural completeness, and spatial accuracy. Clinical simulations indicate UniDCF reduces reconstruction design time by 99% and achieves clinician-rated acceptability exceeding 94%. Overall, UniDCF enables rapid, automated, and high-fidelity reconstruction, supporting personalized and precise restorative treatments, streamlining clinical workflows, and enhancing patient outcomes."}

Drawing on concepts from science and technology studies, we analyse three dominant narrative groups: existential risk proponents, who emphasise catastrophic AGI scenarios; accelerationists, who portray AI as a transformative force to be unleashed; and critical AI scholars, who foreground present-day harms rooted in systemic inequality. Through an analysis of representative manifesto-style texts, we explore how these imaginaries differ across four dimensions: normative visions of the future, diagnoses of the present social order, views on science and technology, and perceived human agency in managing AI risks. Our findings reveal how these narratives embed distinct assumptions about risk and have the potential to progress into policy-making processes by narrowing the space for alternative governance approaches. We argue against speculative dogmatism and for moving beyond deterministic imaginaries toward regulatory strategies that are grounded in pragmatism."}

Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs), static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ, n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers."}

SafeSieve integrates initial LLM-based semantic evaluation with accumulated performance feedback, enabling a smooth transition from heuristic initialization to experience-driven refinement. Unlike existing greedy Top-k pruning methods, SafeSieve employs 0-extension clustering to preserve structurally coherent agent groups while eliminating ineffective links. Experiments across benchmarks (SVAMP, HumanEval, etc.) showcase that SafeSieve achieves 94.01% average accuracy while reducing token usage by 12.4%-27.8%.

Ovis2.5 integrates a native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native, variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional \"thinking mode\" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the \"small model, big performance\" philosophy of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios.

MFMs integrate diverse data sources, such as imaging, clinical records, and bio signals, to support comprehensive decision-making, while LLMs facilitate clinical documentation, patient triage, translation, and virtual assistance. Together, these technologies can revolutionize rural healthcare by augmenting human capacity, reducing diagnostic delays, and democratizing access to expertise.

The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language understanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with robots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem.In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that work closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better collaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system with a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts with both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its experiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three specific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and present a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each.

While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, these models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible to implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to improve multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization framework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity, and training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both influence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in small models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and scaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup, successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic data to train robust and fair vision-language models.

However, they often suffer from limited annotated data, highlighting the need for a general-purpose bioacoustic encoder capable of extracting useful representations for diverse downstream tasks. Such encoders have been proposed before, but are often limited in scope due to a focus on a narrow range of species (typically birds), and a reliance on a single model architecture or training paradigm. Moreover, they are usually evaluated on a small set of tasks and datasets. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical study that covers aspects of bioacoustics that are relevant to research but have previously been scarcely considered: training data diversity and scale, model architectures and training recipes, and the breadth of evaluation tasks and datasets. We obtain encoders that are state-of-the-art on the existing and proposed benchmarks. We also identify what matters for training these encoders, such that this work can be extended when more data are available or better architectures are proposed. Specifically, across 26 datasets with tasks including species classification, detection, individual ID, and vocal repertoire discovery, we find self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised post-training on a mixed bioacoustics + general-audio corpus yields the strongest in- and out-of-distribution performance.

Experiments with university-level candidates show that the system consistently aligns its assessments with job requirements, faithfully preserves resume content, and earns high satisfaction ratings, with the lightweight Gemma 3 model producing the most engaging conversations. Qualitative findings revealed that the standardized Japanese resume format improved document retrieval while diverse English resumes introduced additional variability, and they highlighted how cultural norms shape follow-up questioning strategies.

Proving an algorithm's performance guarantee across all inputs has traditionally required extensive and often error-prone human effort. While AI has shown great success in finding solutions to specific problem instances, automating the discovery of general algorithms with such provable guarantees has remained a significant barrier. This challenge stems from the difficulty of integrating the creative process of algorithm design with the rigorous process of formal analysis. To address this gap, we propose LegoNE, a framework that tightly fuses these two processes for the fundamental and notoriously difficult problem of computing approximate Nash equilibria. LegoNE automatically translates any algorithm written by a simple Python-like language into a constrained optimization problem. Solving this problem derives and proves the algorithm's approximation bound. Using LegoNE, a state-of-the-art large language model rediscovered the state-of-the-art algorithm for two-player games within hours, a feat that had taken human researchers 15 years to achieve. For three-player games, the model discovered a novel algorithm surpassing all existing human-designed ones. This work demonstrates a new human-machine collaborative paradigm for theoretical science: humans reason at a higher-abstract level, using symbols to compress the search space, and AI explores within it, achieving what neither could alone."}

For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks.

We propose J6, a structured Jacobian-based method that decomposes the gradient interaction matrix into six interpretable components. This decomposition enables both hard decision-making (e.g., choosing the dominant update direction via argmax) and soft strategies (e.g., attention-style weighting via softmax over J6), forming a dynamic update framework that adapts to local conflict and synergy. Moreover, the interpretable structure of J6 provides insight into parameter attribution, task interference, and geometry-aligned adaptation.

In this study, we present a lightweight AI assistant that interprets Skew-T diagrams using a small language model (LM) and a small VLM fine-tuned to emulate human forecasters. Using a curriculum learning framework, we first train the models to identify key atmospheric features from diagrams through visual question answering, followed by chain-of-thought reasoning tasks that estimate precipitation probability based on the derived visual groundings. Model inputs include either textual summaries or generated Skew-T diagrams derived from operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts, paired with three-hour precipitation observations from South Korea's Auto Weather Stations network. Evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned VLM achieves skill comparable to an operational NWP model, despite relying solely on static atmospheric profiles.

Specifically, our method biases a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm -- run using a model of the target environment -- using action priors defined by the VLA policy. By using VLA-derived abstractions and priors in model-based search, VLAPS efficiently explores language-conditioned robotics tasks whose search spaces would otherwise be intractably large.

While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal protein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The concatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the protein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between modalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window, ProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it incompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its generalization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a lightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under few-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that fuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively reducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then we propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration into the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average demonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the original ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of approximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting. Without modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number of additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding compression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the self-compression stage.

Existing studies have employed various AI/ML-based approaches, and with the recent development of large language models, researchers have leveraged LLMs to tackle this problem. These approaches suffer from two main issues. First, LLMs are constrained by limited context windows and cannot ingest all of the available data sources, such as long commit histories, extensive issue comments, and large code repositories. Second, most methods operate on individual issue-commit pairs; that is, given a single issue-commit pair, they determine whether the commit resolves the issue. This quickly becomes impractical in real-world repositories containing tens of thousands of commits. To address these limitations, we present LinkAnchor, the first autonomous LLM-based agent designed for issue-to-commit link recovery. The lazy-access architecture of LinkAnchor enables the underlying LLM to access the rich context of software, spanning commits, issue comments, and code files, without exceeding the token limit by dynamically retrieving only the most relevant contextual data. Additionally, LinkAnchor is able to automatically pinpoint the target commit rather than exhaustively scoring every possible candidate. Our evaluations show that LinkAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art issue-to-commit link recovery approaches by 60-262% in Hit@1 score across all our case study projects.

To address this limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\\&P-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation.

However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings."}

This Essay reveals the fatal flaw: though AI poses national security challenges, the solution demands stronger regulatory frameworks, not weaker ones. A race without guardrails breeds shared danger, not competitive strength. The Regulation Sacrifice makes three false promises. First, it promises durable technological leads. But AI capabilities spread rapidly - performance gaps between U.S. and Chinese systems collapsed from 9 percent to 2 percent in thirteen months. When advantages evaporate in months, sacrificing permanent safety for temporary speed makes no sense. Second, it promises deregulation accelerates innovation. The opposite often proves true. Companies report well-designed governance streamlines development. Investment flows toward regulated markets. Clear rules reduce uncertainty; uncertain liability creates paralysis. Environmental standards did not kill the auto industry; they created Tesla and BYD. Third, enhanced national security through deregulation actually undermines security across all timeframes. Near term: it hands adversaries information warfare tools. Medium term: it democratizes bioweapon capabilities. Long term: it guarantees deployment of uncontrollable AGI systems.

The complexity of visual data introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious correlations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of overfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces (Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while maintaining computational efficiency.

In this paper, we uncover a systematic failure of LLMs in evaluating whether code aligns with natural language requirements. Specifically, with widely used benchmarks, we employ unified prompts to judge code correctness. Our results reveal that LLMs frequently misclassify correct code implementations as either ``not satisfying requirements'' or containing potential defects. Surprisingly, more complex prompting, especially when leveraging prompt engineering techniques involving explanations and proposed corrections, leads to higher misjudgment rate, which highlights the critical reliability issues in using LLMs as code review assistants. We further analyze the root causes of these misjudgments, and propose two improved prompting strategies for mitigation. For the first time, our findings reveals unrecognized limitations in LLMs to match code with requirements.

However, current applications of SMC to diffusion models face a fundamental dilemma: early-stage noise samples offer high potential for improvement but are difficult to evaluate accurately, whereas late-stage samples can be reliably assessed but are largely irreversible. To address this exploration-exploitation trade-off, we approach the problem from the perspective of the search algorithm and propose two strategies: Funnel Schedule and Adaptive Temperature. These simple yet effective methods are tailored to the unique generation dynamics and phase-transition behavior of diffusion models.

To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs. Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model.

The Constructor Agent incrementally integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90\\%, with strong inter-rater agreement.

In this paper, we present the first analysis of dLLMs' safety performance and propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to their unique generation characteristics. Specifically, we identify a critical asymmetry between the defender and attacker in terms of security. For the defender, we reveal that the middle tokens of the response, rather than the initial ones, are more critical to the overall safety of dLLM outputs; this seems to suggest that aligning middle tokens can be more beneficial to the defender. The attacker, on the contrary, may have limited power to manipulate middle tokens, as we find dLLMs have a strong tendency towards a sequential generation order in practice, forcing the attack to meet this distribution and diverting it from influencing the critical middle tokens. Building on this asymmetry, we introduce Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA), a novel method that directly aligns the model's middle generation with safe refusals exploiting reinforcement learning. We implement MOSA and compare its security performance against eight attack methods on two benchmarks. We also test the utility of MOSA-aligned dLLM on coding, math, and general reasoning.

Through selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%).

For former, we employ a reformulation that transforms it into a non-concave-convex max-min optimization problem with suitably defined feasible sets and objective function. The new form can be viewed as a generalization of Sion's minimax theorem. Next, we introduce EXOTIC-an Exact, Optimistic, Tree-based algorithm for solving the reformulated max-min problem. EXOTIC employs an iterative convex optimization solver to (approximately) solve the inner minimization and a hierarchical tree search for the outer maximization to optimistically select promising regions to search based on the approximate solution returned by convex optimization solver. We establish an upper bound on its optimality gap as a function of the number of calls to the inner solver, the solver's convergence rate, and additional problem-dependent parameters.

On each eviction, Cold-RL samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features (age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT), and requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers immediate fallback to native LRU.

Although association studies utilizing the new sequencing technologies hold great promise to unravel novel genetic variants, especially rare genetic variants that contribute to human diseases, the statistical analysis of high-dimensional sequencing data remains a challenge. Advanced analytical methods are in great need to facilitate high-dimensional sequencing data analyses. In this article, we propose a generalized genetic random field (GGRF) method for association analyses of sequencing data. Like other similarity-based methods (e.g., SIMreg and SKAT), the new method has the advantages of avoiding the need to specify thresholds for rare variants and allowing for testing multiple variants acting in different directions and magnitude of effects. The method is built on the generalized estimating equation framework and thus accommodates a variety of disease phenotypes (e.g., quantitative and binary phenotypes). Moreover, it has a nice asymptotic property, and can be applied to small-scale sequencing data without need for small-sample adjustment. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed GGRF attains an improved or comparable power over a commonly used method, SKAT, under various disease scenarios, especially when rare variants play a significant role in disease etiology. We further illustrate GGRF with an application to a real dataset from the Dallas Heart Study. By using GGRF, we were able to detect the association of two candidate genes, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, with serum triglyceride."}

Boge,Annika Schuster", "title": "How can we trust opaque systems? Criteria for robust explanations in XAI", "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) algorithms are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life and in scientific research. However, the price we pay for their impressively accurate predictions is significant: their inner workings are notoriously opaque - it is unknown to laypeople and researchers alike what features of the data a DL system focuses on and how it ultimately succeeds in predicting correct outputs. A necessary criterion for trustworthy explanations is that they should reflect the relevant processes the algorithms' predictions are based on. The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) presents promising methods to create such explanations. But recent reviews about their performance offer reasons for skepticism. As we will argue, a good criterion for trustworthiness is explanatory robustness: different XAI methods produce the same explanations in comparable contexts. However, in some instances, all methods may give the same, but still wrong, explanation. We therefore argue that in addition to explanatory robustness (ER), a prior requirement of explanation method robustness (EMR) has to be fulfilled by every XAI method. Conversely, the robustness of an individual method is in itself insufficient for trustworthiness. In what follows, we develop and formalize criteria for ER as well as EMR, providing a framework for explaining and establishing trust in DL algorithms. We also highlight interesting application cases and outline directions for future work."}

However, these methods fail to accommodate cloud latency fluctuations and overlook the full potential of delayed but accurate LVLM responses. In this work, we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for VLMs, termed Context Transfer, which treats the delayed outputs of LVLMs as historical context to provide real-time guidance for SVLMs inference. Based on this paradigm, we design SpotVLM, which incorporates both context replacement and visual focus modules to refine historical textual input and enhance visual grounding consistency.

Although DiffAN addresses these limitations by substituting kernel-based estimates with diffusion models, it remains numerically unstable due to the second-order derivatives of score models. To alleviate these problems, we propose Score-informed Neural Operator (SciNO), a probabilistic generative model in smooth function spaces designed to stably approximate the Hessian diagonal and to preserve structural information during the score modeling. Empirical results show that SciNO reduces order divergence by 42.7% on synthetic graphs and by 31.5% on real-world datasets on average compared to DiffAN, while maintaining memory efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic control algorithm for causal reasoning with autoregressive models that integrates SciNO's probability estimates with autoregressive model priors, enabling reliable data-driven causal ordering informed by semantic information. Consequently, the proposed method enhances causal reasoning abilities of LLMs without additional fine-tuning or prompt engineering."}

These hierarchies can simplify coordination, but they also can introduce trade-offs that are not always obvious. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional taxonomy for HMAS along five axes: control hierarchy, information flow, role and task delegation, temporal layering, and communication structure. The intent is not to prescribe a single \"best\" design but to provide a lens for comparing different approaches.Rather than treating these dimensions in isolation, the taxonomy is connected to concrete coordination mechanisms - from the long-standing contract-net protocol for task allocation to more recent work in hierarchical reinforcement learning. Industrial contexts illustrate the framework, including power grids and oilfield operations, where agents at production, maintenance, and supply levels coordinate to diagnose well issues or balance energy demand. These cases suggest that hierarchical structures may achieve global efficiency while preserving local autonomy, though the balance is delicate.The paper closes by identifying open challenges: making hierarchical decisions explainable to human operators, scaling to very large agent populations, and assessing whether learning-based agents such as large language models can be safely integrated into layered frameworks. This paper presents what appears to be the first taxonomy that unifies structural, temporal, and communication dimensions of hierarchical MAS into a single design framework, bridging classical coordination mechanisms with modern reinforcement learning and large language model agents."}

Moreover, Gaussian noise has the potential to corrupt personalized information within latent representations.

How to learn effective feature representations and how to explore the similarities between different image sets are two key yet challenging issues in this field. However, existing traditional ISC methods classify image sets based on raw pixel features, ignoring the importance of feature learning. Existing deep ISC methods can learn deep features, but they fail to adaptively adjust the features when measuring set distances, resulting in limited performance in few-shot ISC. To address the above issues, this paper combines traditional ISC methods with deep models and proposes a novel few-shot ISC approach called Deep Class-specific Collaborative Representation (DCSCR) network to simultaneously learn the frame- and concept-level feature representations of each image set and the distance similarities between different sets. Specifically, DCSCR consists of a fully convolutional deep feature extractor module, a global feature learning module, and a class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module. The deep feature extractor and global feature learning modules are used to learn (local and global) frame-level feature representations, while the class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module is exploit to adaptively learn the concept-level feature representation of each image set and thus obtain the distance similarities between different sets by developing a new CSCR-based contrastive loss function.

Using six LLM judges and two benchmarks (BigGen Bench and Chatbot Arena), Bridge achieves higher agreement with human ratings (accuracy, calibration, and KL divergence) and exposes systematic human-LLM gaps."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information, yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1) Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides supervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3) Atom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns."}

This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector.

There has been a substantial body of research developing models for determining if a social media post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on exploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that can be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational exchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent tweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if a reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the most? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from the context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only looking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study, we test four different classification models on a dataset made of conversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as abusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features leads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from the reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We observe that, among the features under study, it is especially the content-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the classification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting it). While using content-based features, it is best to combine a range of different features to ensure improved performance over being more selective and using fewer features. Our study provides insights into the development of contextualized abusive language detection models in realistic settings involving conversations."}

However, LLM-generated Verilog code often suffers from security vulnerabilities, which is particularly concerning for security-sensitive FSM implementations. To address this issue, we propose SecFSM, a novel method that leverages a security-oriented knowledge graph to guide LLMs in generating more secure Verilog code. Specifically, we first construct a FSM Security Knowledge Graph (FSKG) as an external aid to LLMs. Subsequently, we analyze users' requirements to identify vulnerabilities and get a list of vulnerabilities in the requirements. Then, we retrieve knowledge from FSKG based on the vulnerabilities list. Finally, we construct security prompts based on the security knowledge for Verilog code generation. To evaluate SecFSM, we build a dedicated dataset collected from academic datasets, artificial datasets, papers, and industrial cases.

It can develop generalized representations or more balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term knowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging incremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have achieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the generalization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it helps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and robustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual methods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform even worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical samples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a two-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on sequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially, SEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized representations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and balance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation (KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more generalized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of its components. The code is available atthis https URL."}

To tackle this challenge, we propose a communication-efficient SL framework, named SL-ACC, which comprises two key components: adaptive channel importance identification (ACII) and channel grouping compression (CGC). ACII first identifies the contribution of each channel in the smashed data to model training using Shannon entropy. Following this, CGC groups the channels based on their entropy and performs group-wise adaptive compression to shrink the transmission volume without compromising training accuracy.

One reason is that official greenery metrics measure the amount or nearness of greenery but ignore how often people actually may potentially see or use it in daily life. To address this gap, we introduced a new classification that separates on-road greenery, which people see while walking through streets, from off-road greenery, which requires planned visits. We did so by combining aerial imagery of Greater London and greenery data from OpenStreetMap with quantified greenery from over 100,000 Google Street View images and accessibility estimates based on 160,000 road segments. We linked these measures to 7.45 billion medical prescriptions issued by the National Health Service and processed through our methodology. These prescriptions cover five conditions: diabetes, hypertension, asthma, depression, and anxiety, as well as opioid use. As hypothesized, we found that green on-road was more strongly linked to better health than four widely used official measures. For example, hypertension prescriptions dropped by 3.68% in wards with on-road greenery above the median citywide level compared to those below it. If all below-median wards reached the citywide median in on-road greenery, prescription costs could fall by up to £3.15 million each year.

To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models (SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of data for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking, which resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition. However, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is first acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two distinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA Interaction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input the question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create knowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student model as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts for problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge Generator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only knowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to perform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR and DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference process needs to be iterated if not.

Text is the most common format for generated persona attributes, followed by numbers. Text and numbers are often generated together, and demographic attributes are included in nearly all generated personas. Researchers use up to 12 prompts in a single study, though most research uses a small number of prompts. Comparison and testing multiple LLMs is rare. More than half of the prompts require the persona output in a structured format, such as JSON, and 74% of the prompts insert data or dynamic variables.

Experiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30) using three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF consistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE, RMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were confirmed via visualizations and statistical tests. Conversely, FMAE offers advantages in local metrics (MAE, MASE) and execution time, making it suitable for short-term scenarios. The study highlights a methodological trade-off: HEF is ideal for strategic planning, while FMAE is better suited for operational efficiency.

In this paper, we observe that current causal and diffusion models encounter difficulties in problems that require adaptive token generation orders to solve tractably, which we characterize with the $\\mathcal{V}$-information framework. Motivated by this, we propose Reinforced Context Order Recovery (ReCOR), a reinforcement-learning-based framework to extract adaptive, data-dependent token generation orders from text data without annotations. Self-supervised by token prediction statistics, ReCOR estimates the hardness of predicting every unfilled token and adaptively selects the next token during both training and inference.

Although existing detection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to features used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between LLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this hypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural activation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we propose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method. Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better identify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of the text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a precomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms all baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD scenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and mainstream attacks.

In recent years, the knowledge graph has emerged as a universal data format for representing knowledge about heterogeneous entities and their relationships. The knowledge graph can be modeled by knowledge graph embedding methods, which represent entities and relations as embedding vectors in semantic space, then model the interactions between these embedding vectors. However, the semantic structures in the knowledge graph embedding space are not well-studied, thus knowledge graph embedding methods are usually only used for knowledge graph completion but not data representation and analysis. In this paper, we propose to analyze these semantic structures based on the well-studied word embedding space and use them to support data exploration. We also define the semantic queries, which are algebraic operations between the embedding vectors in the knowledge graph embedding space, to solve queries such as similarity and analogy between the entities on the original datasets. We then design a general framework for data exploration by semantic queries and discuss the solution to some traditional scholarly data exploration tasks. We also propose some new interesting tasks that can be solved based on the uncanny semantic structures of the embedding space."}

Furthermore, AI-enabled systems exist within a wider ecosystem of actors, decisions, and governance structures, giving rise to complex networks of responsibility relations. To address these issues, this paper presents a conceptual framework of responsibility, accompanied with a graphical notation and general methodology for visualising these responsibility networks and for tracing different responsibility attributions for AI. Taking the three-part formulation \"Actor A is responsible for Occurrence O,\" the framework unravels the concept of responsibility to clarify that there are different possibilities of who is responsible for AI, senses in which they are responsible, and aspects of events they are responsible for. The notation allows these permutations to be represented graphically. The methodology enables users to apply the framework to specific scenarios. The aim is to offer a foundation to support stakeholders from diverse disciplinary backgrounds to discuss and address complex responsibility questions in hypothesised and real-world cases involving AI.

Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a greater challenge that requires the model to learn new classes from only a limited number of samples per class. While incremental learning typically assumes restricted access to past data, it often remains available in many real-world scenarios. This raises a practical question: should one retrain the model on the full dataset (i.e., joint training), or continue updating it solely with new data? In CIL, joint training is considered an ideal benchmark that provides a reference for evaluating the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. However, in FSCIL, joint training becomes less reliable due to severe imbalance between base and incremental classes. This results in the absence of a practical baseline, making it unclear which strategy is preferable for practitioners. To this end, we revisit joint training in the context of FSCIL by incorporating imbalance mitigation techniques, and suggest a new imbalance-aware joint training benchmark for FSCIL. We then conduct extensive comparisons between this benchmark and FSCIL methods to analyze which approach is most suitable when prior data is accessible.

While prior work has noted position order biases in LLM-driven comparisons, these biases have not been systematically analyzed or linked to underlying preference structures. We present the first comprehensive study of position biases across multiple LLMs and two distinct domains: resume comparisons, representing a realistic high-stakes context, and color selection, which isolates position effects by removing confounding factors. We find strong and consistent order effects, including a quality-dependent shift: when all options are high quality, models favor the first option, but when quality is lower, they favor later options. We also identify two previously undocumented biases in both human and machine decision-making: a centrality bias (favoring the middle position in triplewise comparisons) and a name bias, where certain names are favored despite controlling for demographic signals. To separate superficial tie-breaking from genuine distortions of judgment, we extend the rational choice framework to classify pairwise preferences as robust, fragile, or indifferent. Using this framework, we show that order effects can lead models to select strictly inferior options, and that position biases are typically stronger than gender biases. These results indicate that LLMs exhibit distinct failure modes not documented in human decision-making. We also propose targeted mitigation strategies, including a novel use of the temperature parameter, to recover underlying preferences when order effects distort model behavior."}

This often results in agents settling into local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new benchmark with 500 trajectories.

To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator, coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination, confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning, enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate diverse information sources.

This process of \"prompt evolution\" is driven by a novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to systematically refine its generative strategy.

Existing efficient reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy.

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical, unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected ``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network. Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval. Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in response quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

Introducing these non-ideal device behaviors in DNN training enhances robustness, but drawbacks include limited accuracy improvement, reduced prediction confidence, and convergence issues. This arises from a mismatch between the deterministic training and non-deterministic device variations, as such training, though considering variations, relies solely on the model's final output.

However, SAM struggles with geographical images, such as aerial and satellite imagery, due to its training being confined to natural images and the narrow features and textures of these objects blending into their surroundings. To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a SAM-based framework that fine-tunes SAM using automatically generated multi-modal prompts. Specifically, GeoSAM integrates point prompts from a pre-trained task-specific model as primary visual guidance, and text prompts generated by a large language model as secondary semantic guidance, enabling the model to better capture both spatial structure and contextual meaning. GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for mobility infrastructure segmentation in both familiar and completely unseen regions by at least 5\\% in mIoU, representing a significant leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure, including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images.

Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets.

This paper presents a contrasting viewpoint, perceiving data points as interconnected and employing a Markov reward process (MRP) for data modeling. We reformulate the typical supervised learning as an on-policy policy evaluation problem within reinforcement learning (RL), introducing a generalized temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm as a resolution. Theoretically, our analysis establishes connections between the solutions of linear TD learning and ordinary least squares (OLS). Under specific conditions -- particularly when the noise is correlated -- the TD solution serves as a more effective estimator than OLS. Furthermore, we show that when our algorithm is applied with many commonly used loss functions -- such as those found in generalized linear models -- it corresponds to the application of a novel and generalized Bellman operator. We prove that this operator admits a unique fixed point, and based on this, we establish convergence guarantees for our generalized TD algorithm under linear function approximation. Empirical studies verify our theoretical results, examine the vital design of our TD algorithm and show practical utility across various datasets, encompassing tasks such as regression and image classification with deep learning."}

There is also a pressing need to select spectral models suitable for learning specific graph data and deploying them to massive web-scale graphs, which is currently constrained by the varied model designs and training settings.In this work, we extensively benchmark spectral GNNs with a focus on the spectral perspective, demystifying them as spectral graph filters. We analyze and categorize 35 GNNs with 27 corresponding filters, spanning diverse formulations and utilizations of the graph data. Then, we implement the filters within a unified spectral-oriented framework with dedicated graph computations and efficient training schemes. In particular, our implementation enables the deployment of spectral GNNs over million-scale graphs and various tasks with comparable performance and less overhead. Thorough experiments are conducted on the graph filters with comprehensive metrics on effectiveness and efficiency, offering novel observations and practical guidelines that are only available from our evaluations across graph scales.

However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems."}

Our MCTS solution is an online and anytime algorithm alternating planning and execution that determines the next vertex to visit by continuously monitoring the remaining travel budget. The novelty of our work is that the rollout phase in the MCTS framework is implemented using a message passing GNN, predicting both the utility and failure probability of each available action.

One proposed benefit of this model is to allow agents to model the attention states of other agents, and thus predict and interact with other agents. The effects of an attention schema may be examined in artificial agents. Although attention mechanisms in artificial agents are different from in biological brains, there may be some principles in common. In both cases, select features or representations are emphasized for better performance. Here, using neural networks with transformer attention mechanisms, we asked whether the addition of an attention schema affected the ability of agents to make judgements about and cooperate with each other. First, we found that an agent with an attention schema is better at categorizing the attention states of other agents (higher accuracy). Second, an agent with an attention schema develops a pattern of attention that is easier for other agents to categorize. Third, in a joint task where two agents must predict each other to paint a scene together, adding an attention schema improves performance. Finally, the performance improvements are not caused by a general increase in network complexity. Instead, improvement is specific to tasks involving judging, categorizing, or predicting the attention of other agents. These results support the hypothesis that an attention schema has computational properties beneficial to mutual interpretability and interactive behavior.

In response, we here present a regression-like loss that operates purely on token level. Our proposed Number Token Loss (NTL) comes in two flavors and minimizes either the $L_p$ norm or the Wasserstein distance between the numerical values of the real and predicted number tokens. NTL can easily be added to any language model and extend the CE objective during training without runtime overhead.

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a promising solution, enabling on-the-fly model adaptation without access to source data. However, its effectiveness degrades significantly in the presence of complex, mixed distribution shifts - common in practical settings - where multiple latent domains coexist. Adapting under such intrinsic heterogeneity, especially in unlabeled and online conditions, remains an open and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we study TTA under mixed distribution shifts and move beyond conventional homogeneous adaptation paradigms. By revisiting TTA from a frequency-domain perspective, we observe that distribution heterogeneity often manifests in Fourier space - for instance, high-frequency components tend to carry domain-specific variations. This motivates us to perform domain-aware separation using high-frequency texture cues, making diverse shift patterns more tractable. To this end, we propose FreDA, a novel Frequency-based Decentralized Adaptation framework that decomposes globally heterogeneous data into locally homogeneous components in the frequency domain.

Although MLLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, designing effective jailbreak attacks poses unique challenges, especially given the highly constrained adversarial capabilities in real-world deployment scenarios. Previous works concentrate risks into a single modality, resulting in limited jailbreak performance. In this paper, we propose a heuristic-induced multimodal risk distribution jailbreak attack method, called HIMRD, which is black-box and consists of two elements: multimodal risk distribution strategy and heuristic-induced search strategy. The multimodal risk distribution strategy is used to distribute harmful semantics into multiple modalities to effectively circumvent the single-modality protection mechanisms of MLLMs. The heuristic-induced search strategy identifies two types of prompts: the understanding-enhancing prompt, which helps MLLMs reconstruct the malicious prompt, and the inducing prompt, which increases the likelihood of affirmative outputs over refusals, enabling a successful jailbreak attack. HIMRD achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 90% across seven open-source MLLMs and an average ASR of around 68% in three closed-source MLLMs. HIMRD reveals cross-modal security vulnerabilities in current MLLMs and underscores the imperative for developing defensive strategies to mitigate such emerging risks.

In contrast, unsigned graph structures are abundant and can be readily leveraged to pre-train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offering a promising solution to reduce supervision requirements in downstream signed graph tasks. However, transferring knowledge from unsigned to signed graphs is non-trivial due to the fundamental discrepancies in graph types and task objectives between pre-training and downstream phases. To address this challenge, we propose Signed Graph Prompt Tuning (SGPT), a novel graph prompting framework that adapts pre-trained unsigned GNNs to few-shot signed graph tasks. We first design a graph template based on balance theory to disentangle mixed node relationships introduced by negative links, mitigating the structural mismatches between unsigned and signed graphs. We further introduce a task template that reformulates downstream signed tasks into a unified link prediction objective, aligning their optimization goals with the pre-training task. Furthermore, we develop feature prompts that align downstream semantic spaces with the feature spaces learned during pre-training, and semantic prompts to integrate link sign semantics in a task-aware manner. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark signed graph datasets, demonstrating that SGPT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a powerful and generalizable solution for few-shot signed graph learning."}

Here, we describe a study evaluating the usefulness of our tool tracking model in automated assessment during a laparoscopic suturing task in the fundoplication procedure. An automated tool tracking model was applied to recorded videos of Nissen fundoplication on porcine bowel. Surgeons were grouped as novices (PGY1-2) and experts (PGY3-5, attendings). The beginning and end of each suturing step were segmented, and motions of the left and right tools were extracted. A low-pass filter with a 24 Hz cut-off frequency removed noise. Performance was assessed using supervised and unsupervised models, and an ablation study compared results. Kinematic features--RMS velocity, RMS acceleration, RMS jerk, total path length, and Bimanual Dexterity--were extracted and analyzed using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost. PCA was performed for feature reduction. For unsupervised learning, a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) model with classifiers, such as a 1-D CNN and traditional models, was trained.

In this work, we interpret Neural Network (NN) solutions to sequence based number tasks using a variety of methods to understand how well we can interpret them through the lens of interpretable Symbolic Algorithms (SAs) -- precise programs describable by rules and typed, mutable variables. We use autoregressive GRUs, LSTMs, and Transformers trained on tasks where the correct tokens depend on numeric information only latent in the task structure. We show through multiple causal and theoretical methods that we can interpret raw NN activity through the lens of simplified SAs when we frame the activity in terms of neural subspaces rather than individual neurons. Using Distributed Alignment Search (DAS), we find that, depending on network architecture, dimensionality, and task specifications, alignments with SA's can be very high, or they can be only approximate, or fail altogether. We extend our analytic toolkit to address the failure cases by expanding the DAS framework to a broader class of alignment functions that more flexibly capture NN activity in terms of interpretable variables from SAs, and we provide theoretic and empirical explorations of Linear Alignment Functions (LAFs) in contrast to the preexisting Orthogonal Alignment Functions (OAFs). Through analyses of specific cases we confirm the usefulness of causal interventions on neural subspaces for NN interpretability, and we show that recurrent models can develop graded, symbol-like number variables in their neural activity.

Data augmentation was performed using various SD and FM models, resulting in 18 distinct augmentation scenarios. Each augmented dataset was used to train a ResNet18 classifier. Model performance was assessed using class-wise and average precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and image fidelity metrics (FID and KID).Results: FM-based augmentation outperformed all other methods, achieving the highest classification accuracy and lowest FID/KID scores, indicating both improved model generalization and realistic image synthesis. SD1, combining image and prompt inputs in the inference process, was the most effective SD variant, suggesting that physician-generated prompts provide meaningful clinical context.

While human-AI teams engaged in 18% more process and content communication, human-human teams engaged in 29% more social and emotional communication. Humans in human-AI teams experienced 73% greater productivity per worker and produced higher-quality ad copy, while human-human teams produced higher-quality images, suggesting AI agents require fine-tuning for multimodal workflows. Field tests of the ad campaigns accumulated ~5M ad impressions and revealed that ads with higher image quality (produced by human-human collaborations) and higher text quality (produced by human-AI collaborations) performed significantly better on click-through rates, view through rates, and cost per click metrics. Together, these results suggest that human collaboration with AI agents significantly reshapes communication patterns and work processes and increases productivity, while improving some dimensions of output quality and deteriorating others.

Yet, these approaches assume perfect execution from low-level policies, which is unrealistic in real-world environments with noise or suboptimal behaviors. To overcome this, we fully discard the pretrained low-level policy and instead use the LLM to directly generate executable code plans within a closed-loop framework.

Complementing this, a reporter evaluates outcomes using RGB-D and delivers structured feedback, enabling recovery from misalignment and replanning under partial observability. This design eliminates per-step inference, reduces computational overhead, and limits error accumulation that was observed in previous methods.

Lew,Tim Vieira", "title": "Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling", "abstract": "The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models."}

Yet, a systematic understanding of how AI assistance affects different aspects of the writing process - and how this shapes writers' agency - remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of 109 HCI papers using the PRISMA approach. From this literature, we identify four overarching design strategies for AI writing support: structured guidance, guided exploration, active co-writing, and critical feedback - mapped across the four key cognitive processes in writing: planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. We complement this analysis with interviews of 15 writers across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that writers' desired levels of AI intervention vary across the writing process: content-focused writers (e.g., academics) prioritize ownership during planning, while form-focused writers (e.g., creatives) value control over translating and reviewing. Writers' preferences are also shaped by contextual goals, values, and notions of originality and authorship. By examining when ownership matters, what writers want to own, and how AI interactions shape agency, we surface both alignment and gaps between research and user needs. Our findings offer actionable design guidance for developing human-centered writing tools for co-writing with AI, on human terms."}

Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect and scale, but leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to the lack of explicit action labels and human-robot embodiment differences. We propose Human2Sim2Robot, a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies using only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the embodiment gap without relying on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection. From the video, we extract: (1) the object pose trajectory to define an object-centric, embodiment-agnostic reward, and (2) the pre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration during RL training. These components enable effective policy learning without any task-specific reward tuning. In the single human demo regime, Human2Sim2Robot outperforms object-aware replay by over 55% and imitation learning by over 68% on grasping, non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks.

State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based, but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning. Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum multiple individual rewards, \\eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches. Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to 300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark, outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin. Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is the best learning-based approach on nuPlan. It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and 90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of magnitude faster than prior work."}

Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients.

The proposed algorithm, \\emph{Modular Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning} (MOSAIC), improves learning in agentic collectives by combining (1) knowledge selection using performance signals and cosine similarity on Wasserstein task embeddings, (2) modular and transferable neural representations via masks, and (3) policy integration, composition and fine-tuning. MOSAIC outperforms isolated learners and global sharing approaches in both learning speed and overall performance, and in some cases solves tasks that isolated agents cannot. The results also demonstrate that selective, goal-driven reuse leads to less susceptibility to task interference. We also observe the emergence of self-organization, where agents solving simpler tasks accelerate the learning of harder ones through shared knowledge."}

Our approach examines the kernel matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one embedding are also captured in the other model.

One of the main approaches involves measuring the heavytailness of the empirical spectral densities (ESDs) of weight matrices. This analysis has been shown to provide insights to help diagnose whether a model is well-trained or undertrained, and has been used to guide training methods involving layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. In this paper, we address an often-overlooked challenge in estimating the heavytailness of these ESDs: the impact of the aspect ratio of weight matrices. We demonstrate that matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias in estimating the heavytailness of ESDs, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD of these subsampled submatrices. We show that this method effectively mitigates the aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models, scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model (LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. In one of the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model by 17.3% when compared with state-of-the-art methods."}

Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody segmentation, and property modeling.

These tasks are traditionally executed with a linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario (audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.). However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time, while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics, hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors, without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time. The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents."}

Recent studies have revealed the sink token, which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper, the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput, while also achieving superior performance on LongBench."}

We present a data-driven method for estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) from one-dimensional chaotic time series using machine learning. A predictor is trained to produce out-of-sample, multi-horizon forecasts; the LLE is then inferred from the exponential growth of the geometrically averaged forecast error (GMAE) across the horizon, which serves as a proxy for trajectory divergence. We validate the approach on four canonical 1D maps-logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev-achieving R2pos > 0.99 against reference LLE curves with series as short as M = 450. Among baselines, KNN yields the closest fits (KNN-R comparable; RF larger deviations). By design the estimator targets positive exponents: in periodic/stable regimes it returns values indistinguishable from zero. Noise robustness is assessed by adding zero-mean white measurement noise and summarizing performance versus the average SNR over parameter sweeps: accuracy saturates for SNRm > 30 dB and collapses below 27 dB, a conservative sensor-level benchmark. The method is simple, computationally efficient, and model-agnostic, requiring only stationarity and the presence of a dominant positive exponent.

To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance.

This study explores whether deep learning can enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting analysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting data. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical issues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable directions for future research."}

The target object in an image can be described in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.

To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding.

With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb.

Implications of Spatial Inequality for Prediction-Based Allocation Policies", "abstract": "AI-powered scarce resource allocation policies rely on predictions to target either specific individuals (e.g., high-risk) or settings (e.g., neighborhoods). Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates conflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when inequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study and reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based on the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality affects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the RENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the effectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based approaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more versus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to eviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results demonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed through individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area with concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in the prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of deployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk. Our results inform the deployment of AI-based solutions in social service provision that account for particular applications and geographies."}

We evaluate a classical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using Qiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum devices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the low-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware.

We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation up to a fixed number of images per identity.

Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++ (Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time performance at $\\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized models."}

Between a literature digest and a human-comparable research assistant lies their practical application potential. We organize individual tasks that computer science studies employ in separate terms into a guided and robust workflow to evaluate LLMs' processing of academic text input. We employ four tasks in the assessment: content reproduction/comparison/scoring/reflection, each demanding a specific role of the LLM (oracle/judgmental arbiter/knowledgeable arbiter/collaborator) in assisting scholarly works, and altogether testing LLMs with questions that increasingly require intellectual capabilities towards a solid understanding of scientific texts to yield desirable solutions. We exemplify a rigorous performance evaluation with detailed instructions on the prompts. Adopting first-rate Information Systems articles at three top journals as the input texts and an abundant set of text metrics, we record a compromised performance of the leading LLM - Google's Gemini: its summary and paraphrase of academic text is acceptably reliable; using it to rank texts through pairwise text comparison is faintly scalable; asking it to grade academic texts is prone to poor discrimination; its qualitative reflection on the text is self-consistent yet hardly insightful to inspire meaningful research. This evidence against an endorsement of LLMs' text-processing capabilities is consistent across metric-based internal (linguistic assessment), external (comparing to the ground truth), and human evaluation, and is robust to the variations of the prompt. Overall, we do not recommend an unchecked use of LLMs in constructing peer reviews."}

Results show that sequential fine-tuning with a high-resource L1 improves L2 performance, especially for low-resource languages like Yoruba and Turkish.

Our approach extends Byte-Pair Encoding by learning \"superword\" tokens, coherent multi-word expressions that preserve semantic unity while maximizing compression efficiency. SupraTok achieves 31% improvement in English tokenization efficiency (5.91 versus 4.51 characters per token) compared to OpenAI's o200k tokenizer and 30% improvement over Google's Gemma 3 tokenizer (256k vocabulary), while maintaining competitive performance across 38 languages.

With the growing of large language models (LLMs), instruction tuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for ERC. Existing studies mainly focus on multi-stage instruction tuning, which first endows LLMs with speaker characteristics, and then conducts context-aware instruction tuning to comprehend emotional states. However, these methods inherently constrains the capacity to jointly capture the dynamic interaction between speaker characteristics and conversational context, resulting in weak alignment among speaker identity, contextual cues, and emotion states within a unified framework. In this paper, we propose InitERC, a simple yet effective one-stage in-context instruction tuning framework for ERC. InitERC adapts LLMs to learn speaker-context-emotion alignment from context examples via in-context instruction tuning. Specifically, InitERC comprises four components, i.e., demonstration pool construction, in-context example selection, prompt template design, and in-context instruction tuning. To explore the impact of in-context examples, we conduct a comprehensive study on three key factors: retrieval strategy, example ordering, and the number of examples.

To address this issue, we propose an instruction-based continual contrastive tuning approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) in CRE. Different from existing CRE methods that typically handle the training and memory data in a unified manner, this approach splits the training and memory data of each task into two parts respectively based on the correctness of the initial responses and treats them differently through dual-task fine-tuning. In addition, leveraging the advantages of LLM's instruction-following ability, we propose a novel instruction-based contrastive tuning strategy for LLM to continuously correct current cognitive biases with the guidance of previous data in an instruction-tuning manner, which mitigates the gap between old and new relations in a more suitable way for LLMs. We experimentally evaluate our model on TACRED and FewRel, and the results show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art CRE performance with significant improvements, demonstrating the importance of specializing in exploiting error cases."}

To address these limitations, we introduce FineCE, a novel confidence estimation method that delivers accurate, fine-grained confidence scores during text generation. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing training data that effectively captures the underlying probabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict confidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner. Furthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that leverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation for the current sequence during inference.

Through controlled experiments with thinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish logarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a predictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size.

We develop SFM-based approaches for NER and NEL, and find that end-to-end (E2E) models leveraging SFMs can surpass traditional cascaded (speech recognition followed by a text model) approaches. Further, we evaluate E2E SLU models across SFMs and adaptation strategies to assess the impact on task performance.Collectively, this thesis tackles previously unanswered questions about SFMs, providing tools and datasets to further our understanding and to enable the community to make informed design choices for future model development and adoption."}

They often default to fast-thinking behavior by producing direct answers without explicit multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in complex legal scenarios that demand rigorous justification. To address this challenge, we propose Legal$\\Delta$, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance legal reasoning through chain-of-thought guided information gain. During training, Legal$\\Delta$ employs a dual-mode input setup-comprising direct answer and reasoning-augmented modes-and maximizes the information gain between them. This encourages the model to acquire meaningful reasoning patterns rather than generating superficial or redundant explanations. Legal$\\Delta$ follows a two-stage approach: (1) distilling latent reasoning capabilities from a powerful Large Reasoning Model (LRM), DeepSeek-R1, and (2) refining reasoning quality via differential comparisons, combined with a multidimensional reward mechanism that assesses both structural coherence and legal-domain specificity. Experimental results on multiple legal reasoning tasks demonstrate that Legal$\\Delta$ outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and interpretability. It consistently produces more robust and trustworthy legal judgments without relying on labeled preference data. All code and data will be released atthis https URL."}

In addition, probation eligibility requires a comprehensive analysis of both criminal circumstances and remorse. Much of the existing research in IJAS relies primarily on data-driven methodologies, which often overlooks the legal logic underpinning judicial decision-making. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates legal logic into deep learning models for probation prediction, implemented in three distinct stages. First, we construct a specialized probation dataset that includes fact descriptions and probation legal elements (PLEs). Second, we design a distinct probation prediction model named the Multi-Task Dual-Theory Probation Prediction Model (MT-DT), which is grounded in the legal logic of probation and the \\textit{Dual-Track Theory of Punishment}.

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs. Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90\\%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing significant improvements over non-augmented baselines. Case studies further demonstrate the KG's value in literature-based drug repurposing via confidence-aware causal inference."}

There is certain work aiming to optimize the memory footprint of KV cache, inspired by the observation that attention heads can be categorized into retrieval heads that are of great significance and streaming heads that are of less significance. Typically, identifying the streaming heads and and waiving the KV cache in the streaming heads would largely reduce the overhead without hurting the performance that much. However, since employing both retrieval and streaming heads in one layer decomposes one large round of attention computation into two small ones, it may unexpectedly bring extra latency on accessing and indexing tensors. Based on this intuition, we impose an important improvement to the identification process of retrieval and streaming heads, in which we design a criterion that enforces exclusively retrieval or streaming heads gathered in one unique layer. In this way, we further eliminate the extra latency and only incur negligible performance degradation. Our method named \\textsc{ZigzagAttention} is competitive among considered baselines owing to reduced latency and comparable performance."}

Using standardized zero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an Eastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and consistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic and low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx -1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance tendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically significant (p < 0.001). We further compute a Cultural Alignment Index (CAI) against Hofstede's national scores and find GPT-4 aligns more closely with the USA (e.g., IDV CAI approx 0.91; PDI CAI approx 0.88) whereas ERNIE Bot aligns more closely with China (IDV CAI approx 0.85; PDI CAI approx 0.81).

However, identifying the precise mechanisms or internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse, distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs, especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context."}

To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal-Model-Guided Preference Optimization (M3PO), a novel and data-efficient method designed to enhance LVLMs' capabilities in visual instruction following. M3PO intelligently selects the most \"learning-valuable\" preference sample pairs from a diverse pool of LVLM-generated candidates. This selection is driven by a sophisticated mechanism that integrates two crucial signals: a Multimodal Alignment Score (MAS) to assess external quality and the model's Self-Consistency / Confidence (log-probability) to gauge internal belief. These are combined into a novel M3P-Score, which specifically identifies preferred responses and challenging dispreferred responses that the model might confidently generate despite being incorrect.

Typical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems store dialogue history as dense vectors, which capture semantic similarity but neglect finer linguistic structures such as syntactic dependencies, discourse relations, and coreference links. We propose Semantic Anchoring, a hybrid agentic memory architecture that enriches vector-based storage with explicit linguistic cues to improve recall of nuanced, context-rich exchanges. Our approach combines dependency parsing, discourse relation tagging, and coreference resolution to create structured memory entries. Experiments on adapted long-term dialogue datasets show that semantic anchoring improves factual recall and discourse coherence by up to 18% over strong RAG baselines.

Early efforts to identify LLM-generated fake news have predominantly focused on the textual content itself; however, because much of that content may appear coherent and factually consistent, the subtle traces of falsification are often difficult to uncover. Through distributional divergence analysis, we uncover prompt-induced linguistic fingerprints: statistically distinct probability shifts between LLM-generated real and fake news when maliciously prompted. Based on this insight, we propose a novel method named Linguistic Fingerprints Extraction (LIFE). By reconstructing word-level probability distributions, LIFE can find discriminative patterns that facilitate the detection of LLM-generated fake news. To further amplify these fingerprint patterns, we also leverage key-fragment techniques that accentuate subtle linguistic differences, thereby improving detection reliability.

Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1) Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time.

We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that excessive representational entanglement with a dominant variety, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in relation to Arabic dialects, can actively hinder generative modeling. We present the first comprehensive causal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the internal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously estimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling projection-based decoupling from this space. While our study uses Arabic as a case due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the broader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy for generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable. Across 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9 chrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured tradeoff in standard-language performance. These results provide causal evidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict generative capacity for related varieties. More generally, we unify geometric and information-theoretic probing with subspace-level causal interventions, offering practical tools for improving generative modeling in closely related language families and, more broadly, for controlling representational allocation in multilingual and multi-domain LLMs. Code will be released."}

There has been a substantial body of research developing models for determining if a social media post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on exploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that can be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational exchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent tweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if a reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the most? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from the context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only looking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study, we test four different classification models on a dataset made of conversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as abusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features leads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from the reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We observe that, among the features under study, it is especially the content-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the classification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting it). While using content-based features, it is best to combine a range of different features to ensure improved performance over being more selective and using fewer features.

In addition, by leveraging transfer learning, a speech synthesis model pre-trained on read speech undergoes a two-stage fine-tuning process. First, it is fine-tuned on a diverse dataset encompassing various speech styles, including sarcastic speech. In the second stage, the model is further refined using a dataset focused specifically on sarcastic speech, enhancing its ability to generate sarcasm-aware speech. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our proposed methods improve the quality, naturalness, and sarcasm-awareness of synthesized speech."}

A Reasoning Distillation Method via Multi-LoRA Interaction", "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong mathematical reasoning abilities but rely on hundreds of billions of parameters. To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models (SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of data for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking, which resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition. However, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is first acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two distinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA Interaction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input the question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create knowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student model as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts for problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge Generator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only knowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to perform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR and DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference process needs to be iterated if not. This step can enhance the mathematical reasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback. Experimental results show that LoRID achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on the GSM8K dataset, where it outperforms the second-best method by 2.3%, 16.1%, 2.4%, 12.3%, and 1.8% accuracy across the five base models, respectively."}

In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark more reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality evaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in current benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models from worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability between training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better signal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale, and those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These results suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful benchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect signal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has better signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better reliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy subtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable multi-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's intermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We conclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which existing benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise.

Although existing detection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to features used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between LLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this hypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural activation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we propose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method. Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better identify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of the text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a precomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms all baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD scenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and mainstream attacks.

To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for improved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances further enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most relevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques are limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed sequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown beforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently (termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts. This renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially recomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing cross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to reduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of attention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV takes into account the complementary information of other contexts when sparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified information. Experiments demonstrate that our method compresses sequence length to 15% without accuracy degradation compared with full-recompuation baselines, significantly boosting throughput in multi-context RAG scenarios."}

Experiments show that adversarially perturbed words exhibit disproportionately high masking sensitivity compared to naturally important words.

This paper presents the implementations of these models on various datasets of code vulnerability, showing how off-the-shelf models can successfully produce predictive capacity in models through dynamic fine-tuning of the models on vulnerable and safe code fragments. The methodology comprises the gathering of the dataset, normalization of the language, fine-tuning of the model, and incorporation of ensemble learning and explainable AI.

This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup, successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic data to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate that prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and that targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive hate detection."}

However, there is currently a lack of safety study on this novel architecture. In this paper, we present the first analysis of dLLMs' safety performance and propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to their unique generation characteristics. Specifically, we identify a critical asymmetry between the defender and attacker in terms of security. For the defender, we reveal that the middle tokens of the response, rather than the initial ones, are more critical to the overall safety of dLLM outputs; this seems to suggest that aligning middle tokens can be more beneficial to the defender. The attacker, on the contrary, may have limited power to manipulate middle tokens, as we find dLLMs have a strong tendency towards a sequential generation order in practice, forcing the attack to meet this distribution and diverting it from influencing the critical middle tokens. Building on this asymmetry, we introduce Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA), a novel method that directly aligns the model's middle generation with safe refusals exploiting reinforcement learning. We implement MOSA and compare its security performance against eight attack methods on two benchmarks. We also test the utility of MOSA-aligned dLLM on coding, math, and general reasoning. The results strongly prove the superiority of MOSA."}

In this paper, we propose harnessing the capabilities of generative pretrained large language models (LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE using LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied for JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural language understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It exploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its core program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form of type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training data on three well-known benchmarks for JERE.

We then evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models on eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding one billion total tokens. Our empirical study reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence, yet (2) still falls short of human performance across a broad spectrum of tasks.

Our study analyzed two common benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, and found that these might not thoroughly evaluate LLMs' code generation capacities due to limitations in quality, difficulty, and granularity. To resolve this, we introduce the Mostly Hard Python Problems (MHPP) dataset, consisting of 210 unique human-curated problems.

To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs), and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the ``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer' instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions (human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate `first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing `higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops)."}

In this work, we propose modeling tool learning as a dynamic decision-making process and introduce StepTool, a novel step-grained reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs' capabilities in multi-step tool use. StepTool comprises two key components: Step-grained Reward Shaping, which assigns rewards to each tool interaction based on its invocation success and contribution to task completion; and Step-grained Optimization, which applies policy gradient methods to optimize the model across multiple decision steps.

One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text.

This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack.

In response, we here present a regression-like loss that operates purely on token level. Our proposed Number Token Loss (NTL) comes in two flavors and minimizes either the $L_p$ norm or the Wasserstein distance between the numerical values of the real and predicted number tokens. NTL can easily be added to any language model and extend the CE objective during training without runtime overhead. We evaluate the proposed scheme on various mathematical datasets and find that it consistently improves performance in math-related tasks. In a direct comparison on a regression task, we find that NTL can match the performance of a regression head, despite operating on token level. Finally, we scale NTL up to 3B parameter models and observe improved performance, demonstrating its potential for seamless integration into LLMs. We hope to inspire LLM developers to improve their pretraining objectives and distribute NTL as a minimalistic and lightweight PyPI package $ntloss$:this https URL.

To address these issues, we introduce Feather-SQL, a new lightweight framework tailored for SLMs. Feather-SQL improves SQL executability and accuracy through 1) schema pruning and linking, 2) multi-path and multi-candidate generation. Additionally, we introduce the 1+1 Model Collaboration Paradigm, which pairs a strong general-purpose chat model with a fine-tuned SQL specialist, combining strong analytical reasoning with high-precision SQL generation. Experimental results on BIRD demonstrate that Feather-SQL improves NL2SQL performance on SLMs, with around 10% boost for models without fine-tuning. The proposed paradigm raises the accuracy ceiling of SLMs to 54.76%, highlighting its effectiveness."}

Our dataset is constructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample generation using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call recordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency through text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via large language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR outputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that simulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and fraud typologies.

Lew,Tim Vieira", "title": "Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling", "abstract": "The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models."}

However, high-quality responses should do more than just satisfy basic task requirements. An effective response to this query should include quintessential features of an academic talk, such as a compelling opening, clear research questions, and a takeaway. To help identify these implicit criteria, we introduce EvalAgent, a novel framework designed to automatically uncover nuanced and task-specific criteria. EvalAgent first mines expert-authored online guidance. It then uses this evidence to propose diverse, long-tail evaluation criteria that are grounded in reliable external sources. Our experiments demonstrate that the grounded criteria produced by EvalAgent are often implicit (not directly stated in the user's prompt), yet specific (high degree of lexical precision). Further, EvalAgent criteria are often not satisfied by initial responses but they are actionable, such that responses can be refined to satisfy them. Finally, we show that combining LLM-generated and EvalAgent criteria uncovers more human-valued criteria than using LLMs alone."}

To enhance exploration and improve robustness, we introduce Iterative Correction (IC), which refines previously proposed actions by leveraging feedback from the symbolic environment to eliminate invalid decisions and guide the model toward valid alternatives. Additionally, Contrastive Ranking (CR) enables fine-grained comparison of candidate plans by evaluating them jointly. We evaluate SymPlanner on PlanBench, demonstrating that it produces more coherent, diverse, and verifiable plans than pure natural language baselines."}

To address this, we propose Micro token-level Accept-Reject Aligning (MARA) approach designed to operate independently of the language models.

Recent studies have revealed the sink token, which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper, the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput, while also achieving superior performance on LongBench."}

However, the practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient and capable generation."}

MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with trillions of tokens.

This problem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft allow users to easily create custom LLM \"assistants\" specialized to particular types of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized and difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often benefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can then be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask. For example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first select an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary, and then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from the summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms, this setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of each LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus, unlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly affects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs, creating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted for during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm that trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online manner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks, even in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on telecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM selection algorithms."}

Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B, Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models (GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen = 66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between synthetic and real speech.Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in multimodal modeling."}

Diffusion models, in general, have shown excellent ability to improve the generation quality by leveraging inference-time scaling either by increasing the number of denoising steps or by using external verifiers on top of the outputs of each step to guide the generation. In this work, we propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling method that aids in finding a better candidate generation during the denoising process of the MDM.

By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version, SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further boost robustness.

In recent years, the knowledge graph has emerged as a universal data format for representing knowledge about heterogeneous entities and their relationships. The knowledge graph can be modeled by knowledge graph embedding methods, which represent entities and relations as embedding vectors in semantic space, then model the interactions between these embedding vectors. However, the semantic structures in the knowledge graph embedding space are not well-studied, thus knowledge graph embedding methods are usually only used for knowledge graph completion but not data representation and analysis. In this paper, we propose to analyze these semantic structures based on the well-studied word embedding space and use them to support data exploration. We also define the semantic queries, which are algebraic operations between the embedding vectors in the knowledge graph embedding space, to solve queries such as similarity and analogy between the entities on the original datasets. We then design a general framework for data exploration by semantic queries and discuss the solution to some traditional scholarly data exploration tasks. We also propose some new interesting tasks that can be solved based on the uncanny semantic structures of the embedding space."}

To address these shortcomings, we propose Adaptive Parallel Reasoning (APR), a novel reasoning framework that enables language models to orchestrate both serialized and parallel computations end-to-end. APR generalizes existing reasoning methods by enabling adaptive multi-threaded inference using spawn() and join() operations. A key innovation is our end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, optimizing both parent and child inference threads to enhance task success rate without requiring predefined reasoning structures. Experiments on the Countdown reasoning task demonstrate significant benefits of APR: (1) higher performance within the same context window (83.4% vs. 60.0% at 4k context); (2) superior scalability with increased computation (80.1% vs. 66.6% at 20k total tokens); (3) improved accuracy at equivalent latency (75.2% vs. 57.3% at approximately 5,000ms).

Within this process, document reranking plays a critical role in refining first-stage retrieval results. However, standard LLM listwise reranking faces challenges in the scientific domain. First-stage retrieval is often suboptimal in the scientific domain, so relevant documents are ranked lower. Meanwhile, conventional listwise reranking places the full text of candidates into the context window, limiting the number of candidates that can be considered. As a result, many relevant documents are excluded before reranking, constraining overall retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we explore semantic-feature-based compact document representations (e.g., categories, sections, and keywords) and propose CoRank, a training-free, model-agnostic reranking framework for scientific retrieval. It presents a three-stage solution: (i) offline extraction of document features, (ii) coarse-grained reranking using these compact representations, and (iii) fine-grained reranking on full texts of the top candidates from (ii). This integrated process addresses suboptimal first-stage retrieval: Compact representations allow more documents to fit within the context window, improving candidate set coverage, while the final fine-grained ranking ensures a more accurate ordering. Experiments on 5 academic retrieval datasets show that CoRank significantly improves reranking performance across different LLM backbones (average nDCG@10 from 50.6 to 55.5). Overall, these results underscore the synergistic interaction between information extraction and information retrieval, demonstrating how structured semantic features can enhance reranking in the scientific domain."}

In this work, we propose to unlock generalizable learning of graph with post-training alignment with synthetic data. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in direct fine-tuning, we posit that post-training alignment would help LLMs grasp the essentials underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting on synthetic data. We employ post-training alignment algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our post-training alignment recipe leads to statistically significant improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9% over baseline settings.

In this work, we focus on analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We show that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a model to recall a value associated with a single key without context, insufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling. To address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel synthetic task, \\emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value associated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove that SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in sub-quadratic time complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a solution based on integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA), which has the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall with sub-quadratic computation.

By adjusting the rank of the projector, we control the extent of information removal, while its orthogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the embeddings. Our method, termed $\\overline{\\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves state-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on classic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $\\overline{\\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear classifiers, thereby promoting fairness."}

The system consists of two specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback.

All current QAT research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models, where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model), and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\\pm i$, the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically, our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity $\\{\\pm1, \\pm i\\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only additions and element swaps.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate both single and fused ophthalmic FMs. To address these questions, we propose FusionFM, a comprehensive evaluation suite, along with two fusion approaches to integrate different ophthalmic FMs. Our framework covers both ophthalmic disease detection (glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) and systemic disease prediction (diabetes and hypertension) based on retinal imaging. We benchmarked four state-of-the-art FMs (RETFound, VisionFM, RetiZero, and DINORET) using standardized datasets from multiple countries and evaluated their performance using AUC and F1 metrics. Our results show that DINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and systemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on external datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach provides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension.

To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional \"thinking mode\" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced accuracy on difficult inputs.

Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup, successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier generalization.

We empirically analyze visual token sampling in MLLMs and observe a strong correlation between subset token coverage and segmentation performance. This motivates our design of a simple and effective token pruning method that selects a compact yet spatially representative subset of tokens to accelerate inference. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual token pruning method for IVS, called EVTP-IV, which builds upon the k-center by integrating spatial information to ensure better coverage. We further provide an information-theoretic analysis to support our design. Experiments on standard IVS benchmarks show that our method achieves up to 5X speed-up on video tasks and 3.5X on image tasks, while maintaining comparable accuracy using only 20% of the tokens.

LKMN has two core components: Enhanced Partial Large Kernel Block (EPLKB) and Cross-Gate Feed-Forward Network (CGFN). The EPLKB utilizes channel shuffle to boost inter-channel interaction, incorporates channel attention to focus on key information, and applies large kernel strip convolutions on partial channels for non-local feature extraction with reduced complexity. The CGFN dynamically adjusts discrepancies between input, local, and non-local features via a learnable scaling factor, then employs a cross-gate strategy to modulate and fuse these features, enhancing their complementarity.

For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks.

Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme. Extensive experiments across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our compensation strategy effectively mitigates error propagation, significantly enhancing existing PTQ methods to achieve state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance on low-precision diffusion models."}

However, unlike the relatively straightforward pairing of 2D images and text, curating large-scale paired data in the medical field for volumetric modalities such as CT scans remains a challenging and time-intensive process. This difficulty often limits the performance on downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel vision-language pre-training (VLP) framework, termed as \\textbf{VELVET-Med}, specifically designed for limited volumetric data such as 3D CT and associated radiology reports. Instead of relying on large-scale data collection, our method focuses on the development of effective pre-training objectives and model architectures. The key contributions are: 1) We incorporate uni-modal self-supervised learning into VLP framework, which are often underexplored in the existing literature. 2) We propose a novel language encoder, termed as \\textbf{TriBERT}, for learning multi-level textual semantics. 3) We devise the hierarchical contrastive learning to capture multi-level vision-language correspondence. Using only 38,875 scan-report pairs, our approach seeks to uncover rich spatial and semantic relationships embedded in volumetric medical images and corresponding clinical narratives, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the learned encoders.

Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with negligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and infrared) to enhance accuracy.

To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel Weather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of 14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding ground truth annotations and weather labels.

However, classical LRTR-based methods face two critical limitations: (1) they typically assume that the holistic data is low-rank, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios with significant spatial variations; and (2) they are constrained to discrete meshgrid data, limiting their flexibility and applicability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor Representation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling of multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our approach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation that semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics than holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This design not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances adaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel asymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific factor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized heads. By strategically separating global pattern learning from local adaptation, this framework efficiently captures both cross-superpixel commonalities and within-superpixel variations. This yields a representation that is both highly expressive and compact, balancing model efficiency with adaptability. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCTR achieves 3-5 dB PSNR improvements over existing LRTR-based methods across multispectral images, videos, and color images."}

However, they obscure the upper part of the user's face, complicating external video recording and significantly impacting social XR applications such as teleconferencing, where facial expressions and eye gaze details are crucial for creating an immersive experience. This study introduces a geometry-aware learning-based framework to jointly remove HMD occlusions and reconstruct complete 3D facial geometry from RGB frames captured from a single viewpoint. The method integrates a GAN-based video inpainting network, guided by dense facial landmarks and a single occlusion-free reference frame, to restore missing facial regions while preserving identity. Subsequently, a SynergyNet-based module regresses 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from the inpainted frames, enabling accurate 3D face reconstruction. Dense landmark optimization is incorporated throughout the pipeline to improve both the inpainting quality and the fidelity of the recovered geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully remove HMDs from RGB facial videos while maintaining facial identity and realism, producing photorealistic 3D face geometry outputs. Ablation studies further show that the framework remains robust across different landmark densities, with only minor quality degradation under sparse landmark configurations."}

By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance.

Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how to interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation.

Indeed, this makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces (Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods.

Subject-specific ER can benefit significantly from multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods, where each domain corresponds to a specific subject, to improve model accuracy and robustness. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art MSDA approaches often overlook multimodal information or blend sources into a single domain, limiting subject diversity and failing to explicitly capture unique subject-specific characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce MuSACo, a multi-modal subject-specific selection and adaptation method for ER based on co-training. It leverages complementary information across multiple modalities and multiple source domains for subject-specific adaptation. This makes MuSACo particularly relevant for affective computing applications in digital health, such as patient-specific assessment for stress or pain, where subject-level nuances are crucial. MuSACo selects source subjects relevant to the target and generates pseudo-labels using the dominant modality for class-aware learning, in conjunction with a class-agnostic loss to learn from less confident target samples. Finally, source features from each modality are aligned, while only confident target features are combined.

However, directly applying these methods to the task of colorizing old photos is challenging due to the lack of ground truth and the notorious domain gap between natural gray images and old photos. To address this issue, we propose a novel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature Alignment Colorizer. SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo colorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct processing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our primary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two images, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors. We achieve this through a feature distribution alignment loss that remains robust to different metric choices. However, utilizing robust semantic correspondence to transfer color from the reference to the old photo can result in inevitable structure distortions. To mitigate this, we introduce a structure-preserving mechanism that incorporates a perceptual constraint at the feature level and a frozen-updated pyramid at the pixel level.

There is no skeleton foundation model that can be adapted to a wide range of action understanding tasks}. This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense Representation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model for skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a Transformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature Decorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The DSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial structure features. The MG-FD module collaboratively performs feature decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains to reduce dimensional redundancy and enhance information extraction. The MPCT module employs both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training. The former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the impact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the learning of informative multimodal features.

Unlike existing methods that treat all BEV grids equally, AdaBEV introduces a Box-Guided Refinement Module (BG-RM) and an Instance-Background Contrastive Learning (IBCL) to enhance semantic awareness and feature discriminability. BG-RM refines only BEV grids associated with foreground instances using 2D supervision and spatial subdivision, while IBCL promotes stronger separation between foreground and background features via contrastive learning in BEV space.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of the cross-sensor domain gap on state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. To this end, we introduce CamShift, a dataset inspired by nuScenes and created in CARLA to specifically simulate the domain gap between subcompact vehicles and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Using CamShift, we demonstrate significant cross-sensor performance degradation, identify robustness dependencies on model architecture, and propose a data-driven solution to mitigate the effect. On the one hand, we show that model architectures based on a dense Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation with backward projection, such as BEVFormer, are the most robust against varying sensor configurations.

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under adversarial evidence injection.

Second, while existing models can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions. To address these challenges, we present Dual Contrastive Denoising Score, a simple yet powerful framework that leverages the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models.

However, in sparse-view scenarios, despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians, i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians. The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS."}

How to learn effective feature representations and how to explore the similarities between different image sets are two key yet challenging issues in this field. However, existing traditional ISC methods classify image sets based on raw pixel features, ignoring the importance of feature learning. Existing deep ISC methods can learn deep features, but they fail to adaptively adjust the features when measuring set distances, resulting in limited performance in few-shot ISC. To address the above issues, this paper combines traditional ISC methods with deep models and proposes a novel few-shot ISC approach called Deep Class-specific Collaborative Representation (DCSCR) network to simultaneously learn the frame- and concept-level feature representations of each image set and the distance similarities between different sets. Specifically, DCSCR consists of a fully convolutional deep feature extractor module, a global feature learning module, and a class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module. The deep feature extractor and global feature learning modules are used to learn (local and global) frame-level feature representations, while the class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module is exploit to adaptively learn the concept-level feature representation of each image set and thus obtain the distance similarities between different sets by developing a new CSCR-based contrastive loss function. Extensive experiments on several well-known few-shot ISC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with some state-of-the-art image set classification algorithms."}

This necessitates the effective integration of non-local contextual cues and adaptive modeling of region-specific transformations. To this end, we propose a novel Mamba-based network featuring dual-scale fusion and dual-path scanning to selectively propagate contextual information based on transformation similarity across regions. Specifically, the proposed Dual-Scale Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) enhances multi-scale feature representation by fusing original features with low-resolution features, effectively reducing boundary artifacts. The Dual-Path Mamba Group (DPMG) captures global features via horizontal scanning and incorporates a mask-aware adaptive scanning strategy, which improves structural continuity and fine-grained region modeling.

Such limitation may lead to error accumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias. To address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented perspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency Augmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent consistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented baseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight, we introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency representation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module (VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware view through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module (VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information interaction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments.

However, such regularizations often neglect the geometric structure of data distribution, which may lead to distortion of the overall semantic representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel fine-tuning method, Manifold-Preserving and Sculpting Tuning (MPS-Tuning). Regarding the data distribution in feature space as a semantic manifold, MPS-Tuning explicitly constrains the intrinsic geometry of this manifold while further sculpting it to enhance class separability. Specifically, MPS-Tuning preserves both macroscopic and microscopic topological structures of the original manifold by aligning Gram matrices of features before and after fine-tuning. Theoretically, this constraint is shown to approximate an upper bound of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, features from the image and text modalities are paired, and pairwise similarities are optimized to enhance the manifold's class discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPS-Tuning significantly improves model performance while effectively preserving the structure of the semantic manifold. The code will be released."}

In this paper, we introduce a multi-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to effectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic information. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space via a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the representation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral cross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and pseudo points. The first sparse-to-distant (S2D) branch utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to reinforce the representation of sparse LiDAR points. The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to mitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D convolution processes. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative voxel-point aware fine grained pooling module, which captures the spatial information from LiDAR points and textural information from pseudo points in the proposal refinement stage. To achieve more precise refinement during iteration, an intersection over union (IoU) joint prediction branch integrated with a novel proposals generation technique is designed to preserve the bounding boxes with both high IoU and classification scores.

Although recent benchmarks assess text alignment, layout alignment remains overlooked, and no existing benchmark jointly evaluates both. This gap limits the ability to evaluate a model's spatial fidelity, which is crucial when using layout-guided generation for synthetic data, as errors can introduce noise and degrade data quality. In this work, we introduce 7Bench, the first benchmark to assess both semantic and spatial alignment in layout-guided text-to-image generation.

However, these approaches still struggle to meet the practical demands of industrial scenarios in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose HiAD, a general framework for high-resolution anomaly detection.

To enhance both adaptability and efficiency, HiAD utilizes a detector pool in conjunction with various detector assignment strategies, enabling detectors to be adaptively assigned based on patch features, ensuring detection performance while effectively controlling computational costs.

It can develop generalized representations or more balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term knowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging incremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have achieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the generalization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it helps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and robustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual methods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform even worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical samples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a two-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on sequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially, SEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized representations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and balance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation (KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more generalized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of its components. The code is available atthis https URL."}

Considering the scarcity of high-qualified paired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we construct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic videos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the community, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in diverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting simulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the aforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively unleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in synthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos. To implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple the learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from the perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into cinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground preservation. Our project page:this https URL"}

However, existing methods focus on a limited set of joints and low-order motion patterns, limiting the model's ability to understand complex motion patterns. To address this issue, we introduce MaskSem, a novel semantic-guided masking method for learning 3D hybrid high-order motion representations. This novel framework leverages Grad-CAM based on relative motion to guide the masking of joints, which can be represented as the most semantically rich temporal orgions. The semantic-guided masking process can encourage the model to explore more discriminative features. Furthermore, we propose using hybrid high-order motion as the reconstruction target, enabling the model to learn multi-order motion patterns. Specifically, low-order motion velocity and high-order motion acceleration are used together as the reconstruction target. This approach offers a more comprehensive description of the dynamic motion process, enhancing the model's understanding of motion patterns. Experiments on the NTU60, NTU120, and PKU-MMD datasets show that MaskSem, combined with a vanilla transformer, improves skeleton-based action recognition, making it more suitable for applications in human-robot interaction."}

In contrast, open-ended medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Generally, MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection, modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation. Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities, laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental configurations from the RGB branch.

Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos across diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint egocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key challenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated video must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion; 2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the observed visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these challenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built on the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a head-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head joint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that explicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within attention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale real-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel metrics to assess video-motion consistency.

Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for demanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked objects to guide the user during scanning.

A primary challenge arises from ambiguity introduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing corresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as occlusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit photometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that utilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along the epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we finetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions: left-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the right camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right cameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit photometric reconstruction.

A rigorous comparative analysis is conducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and RT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of coastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves marginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\\% IoU (mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's 0.810 and 0.606, respectively.

Building upon this foundation, we construct an object detection model. To validate our approach, we optimize the model by integrating CycleGAN-based data augmentation techniques with the YOLOv5 framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to baseline models on the BDD100K dataset."}

In this paper, we investigate two key aspects of extending linear recurrent models, especially those originally designed for language modeling, to high-order data (1D to ND): scanning strategies and attention-hybrid architectures. Empirical results suggest that scanning provides limited benefits, while attention-hybrid models yield promising results. Focusing on the latter, we further evaluate types of attention and find that tiled high-order sliding window attention (SWA) is efficient in both theory and practice. We term the resulting hybrid architecture of linear recurrence and high-order SWA as Efficient N-dimensional Attention (ENA). We then conduct several experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. The intuition behind ENA is that linear recurrence compresses global information into a state, while SWA complements it by enforcing strict local modeling. Together, they form a simple framework that offers a promising and practical solution for ultra-long high-order data modeling."}

Early BP benchmarks featured synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction, however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset composed of $5\\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM) pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations, including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities."}

To tackle these limitations, we present DermNIO, a versatile foundation model for dermatology. Trained on a curated dataset of 432,776 images from three sources (public repositories, web-sourced images, and proprietary collections), DermNIO incorporates a novel hybrid pretraining framework that augments the self-supervised learning paradigm through semi-supervised learning and knowledge-guided prototype initialization. This integrated method not only deepens the understanding of complex dermatological conditions, but also substantially enhances the generalization capability across various clinical tasks. Evaluated across 20 datasets, DermNIO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across a wide range of tasks. It excels in high-level clinical applications including malignancy classification, disease severity grading, multi-category diagnosis, and dermatological image caption, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance in low-level tasks such as skin lesion segmentation. Furthermore, DermNIO demonstrates strong robustness in privacy-preserving federated learning scenarios and across diverse skin types and sexes.

However, existing approaches often struggle to capture fine-grained local deformations and large-scale global deformations simultaneously within a unified framework. We present FractMorph, a novel 3D dual-parallel transformer-based architecture that enhances cross-image feature matching through multi-domain fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) branches. Each Fractional Cross-Attention (FCA) block applies parallel FrFTs at fractional angles of 0°, 45°, 90°, along with a log-magnitude branch, to effectively extract local, semi-global, and global features at the same time.

To avoid posterior collapse, many prior works have tried to control the influence of regularization loss. However, the trade-off between reconstruction and regularization is not satisfactory. For this reason, several methods have been proposed to guarantee latent identifiability, which is the key to avoiding posterior collapse. However, they require structural constraints on the network architecture. For further clarification, we define local posterior collapse to reflect the importance of individual sample points in the data space and to relax the network constraint. Then, we propose Latent Reconstruction(LR) loss, which is inspired by mathematical properties of injective and composite functions, to control posterior collapse without restriction to a specific architecture.

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on purely geometric or visual data, PROD integrates palpative interaction -- measured through force-controlled surface probing -- to estimate both the static and dynamic response of soft materials. We model the deformation of an object as an elastostatic process and derive a governing Poisson equation for estimating its SDF from a sparse set of pose and force measurements. By incorporating steady-state elastodynamic assumptions, we show that the undeformed SDF can be recovered from deformed observations with provable convergence. Our approach also enables the estimation of material stiffness by analyzing displacement responses to varying force inputs. We demonstrate the robustness of PROD in handling pose errors, non-normal force application, and curvature errors in simulated soft body interactions. These capabilities make PROD a powerful tool for reconstructing deformable objects in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to medical imaging and haptic feedback systems."}

In this paper, we propose a motion-based temporal and rotational calibration framework tailored for event-centric multi-sensor systems, eliminating the need for dedicated calibration targets. Our method uses as input the rotational motion estimates obtained from event cameras and other heterogeneous sensors, respectively. Different from conventional approaches that rely on event-to-frame conversion, our method efficiently estimates angular velocity from normal flow observations, which are derived from the spatio-temporal profile of event data. The overall calibration pipeline adopts a two-step approach: it first initializes the temporal offset and rotational extrinsics by exploiting kinematic correlations in the spirit of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and then refines both temporal and rotational parameters through a joint non-linear optimization using a continuous-time parametrization in SO(3).

One reason is that official greenery metrics measure the amount or nearness of greenery but ignore how often people actually may potentially see or use it in daily life. To address this gap, we introduced a new classification that separates on-road greenery, which people see while walking through streets, from off-road greenery, which requires planned visits. We did so by combining aerial imagery of Greater London and greenery data from OpenStreetMap with quantified greenery from over 100,000 Google Street View images and accessibility estimates based on 160,000 road segments. We linked these measures to 7.45 billion medical prescriptions issued by the National Health Service and processed through our methodology. These prescriptions cover five conditions: diabetes, hypertension, asthma, depression, and anxiety, as well as opioid use. As hypothesized, we found that green on-road was more strongly linked to better health than four widely used official measures. For example, hypertension prescriptions dropped by 3.68% in wards with on-road greenery above the median citywide level compared to those below it. If all below-median wards reached the citywide median in on-road greenery, prescription costs could fall by up to £3.15 million each year. These results suggest that greenery seen in daily life may be more relevant than public yet secluded greenery, and that official metrics commonly used in the literature have important limitations."}

To mitigate this limitation, we introduce the Observation-Centric VLA (OC-VLA) framework, which grounds action predictions directly in the camera observation space. Leveraging the camera's extrinsic calibration matrix, OC-VLA transforms end-effector poses from the robot base coordinate system into the camera coordinate system, thereby unifying prediction targets across heterogeneous viewpoints. This lightweight, plug-and-play strategy ensures robust alignment between perception and action, substantially improving model resilience to camera viewpoint variations.

Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pre-trained on millions of natural images, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot segmentation performance, providing a potential solution. However, SAM struggles with geographical images, such as aerial and satellite imagery, due to its training being confined to natural images and the narrow features and textures of these objects blending into their surroundings. To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a SAM-based framework that fine-tunes SAM using automatically generated multi-modal prompts. Specifically, GeoSAM integrates point prompts from a pre-trained task-specific model as primary visual guidance, and text prompts generated by a large language model as secondary semantic guidance, enabling the model to better capture both spatial structure and contextual meaning. GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for mobility infrastructure segmentation in both familiar and completely unseen regions by at least 5\\% in mIoU, representing a significant leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure, including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images.

This is particularly true for cereal crops, like wheat and barley, that are staple foods and occupy a globally significant share of farmland.

Blackgrass is a major grass weed which causes particular problems in cereal crops in north-west Europe, a major cereal production area, because it has high levels of herbicide resistance. Detecting blackgrass is also difficult due to its similarity to cereals. Yet, a systematic review of the literature on weed recognition in wheat and barley, included in this study, highlights that blackgrass - and grass weeds more broadly - have received less research attention compared to certain broadleaf weeds.

This innovation ensures that density weights adapt intrinsically to the primitive curvature, preserving consistency during shape changes (e.g., from planar disks to curved paraboloids). By solving geodesic distances in closed form on quadric surfaces, QGS enables surface-aware splatting, where a single primitive can represent complex curvature that previously required dozens of planar surfels, potentially reducing memory usage while maintaining efficient rendering via fast ray-quadric intersection.

As an essential part of RAG, external knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from unstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, given the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform representation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various OCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for understanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes 8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG application domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal elements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To better understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to generate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using OHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions and reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases for RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise types and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise and RAG performance.

Then we design a knowledge-augmented multi-stage reasoning framework for question answering, where an auxiliary LLM first retrieves relevant common-sense knowledge (e.g., physical laws), and then video LLM answers the generated questions through a multi-stage reasoning mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ETVA achieves a Spearman's correlation coefficient of 58.47, showing a much higher correlation with human judgment than existing metrics which attain only 31.0. We also construct a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for text-to-video alignment evaluation, featuring 2k diverse prompts and 12k atomic questions spanning 10 categories. Through a systematic evaluation of 15 existing text-to-video models, we identify their key capabilities and limitations, paving the way for next-generation T2V generation."}

To this end, we present RMMSS, a two-stage framework designed to progressively enhance model robustness under missing-modality conditions, while maintaining strong performance in full-modality scenarios. It comprises two key components: the Hybrid Prototype Distillation Module (HPDM) and the Feature Selection Module (FSM).

Fusing monocular priors has been proven helpful for ill-posed matching, but the biased monocular prior learned from small stereo datasets constrains the generalization. Recently, stereo matching has progressed by leveraging the unbiased monocular prior from the vision foundation model (VFM) to improve the generalization in ill-posed regions. We dive into the fusion process and observe three main problems limiting the fusion of the VFM monocular prior. The first problem is the misalignment between affine-invariant relative monocular depth and absolute depth of disparity. Besides, when we use the monocular feature in an iterative update structure, the over-confidence in the disparity update leads to local optima results. A direct fusion of a monocular depth map could alleviate the local optima problem, but noisy disparity results computed at the first several iterations will misguide the fusion. In this paper, we propose a binary local ordering map to guide the fusion, which converts the depth map into a binary relative format, unifying the relative and absolute depth representation. The computed local ordering map is also used to re-weight the initial disparity update, resolving the local optima and noisy problem. In addition, we formulate the final direct fusion of monocular depth to the disparity as a registration problem, where a pixel-wise linear regression module can globally and adaptively align them. Our method fully exploits the monocular prior to support stereo matching results effectively and efficiently.

To address two primary challenges of VH, namely insufficient visual attention and the dominance of language priors, we identify three problematic attention behaviors in LVLMs: (1) disproportionate allocation of attention to uninformative or trailing visual tokens, (2) over-dependence on the previously generated token, and (3) excessive fixation on system prompts that hinders multimodal integration. To overcome these issues, VisFlow introduces a dual-level Attention Intervention, consisting of Token-level Attention Intervention (TAI), which reinforces attention to salient visual regions, and Head-level Attention Intervention (HAI), which suppresses undue focus on system prompts and adjacent text tokens. Together, these interventions strengthen visual alignment while reducing linguistic bias. Extensive experiments across diverse models and benchmarks demonstrate that VisFlow effectively mitigates hallucinations with minimal computational overhead."}

Traditional methods predominantly rely on flow-based propagation and spatio-temporal Transformers, but these approaches face limitations in effectively leveraging long-term temporal features and ensuring temporal consistency in the completion results, particularly when dealing with large masks. Consequently, performance on extensive masked areas remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel video inpainting approach leveraging the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiT synergistically combines the advantages of diffusion models and transformer architectures to maintain long-term temporal consistency while ensuring high-quality inpainting results. We propose a Circular Position-Shift strategy to further enhance long-term temporal consistency during the inference stage. Additionally, the proposed method interactively removes specified objects, and generates corresponding prompts. In terms of processing speed, it takes only 65 seconds (testing on one NVIDIA H800 GPU) to complete a video with a resolution of $2160 \\times 2100$ with 97 frames without any acceleration method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in content fidelity, texture restoration, and temporal consistency. Project page:this https URL"}

Recent research has focused on enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation, searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension, retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs, tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy. Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research."}

In VPT, we uncover ``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution, respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data, de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact, low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count and computation overhead."}

In 3D VQA, the free-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can confuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text generation tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets, the scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading annotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances for training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the oracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a multi-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data based on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more effectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve potentially misleading labels. For uncertainty assessment, we utilize a variance-based metric that takes semantic relationships between terms into consideration, thus avoiding the uniform inter-class similarity assumption of previous assessment metrics. Extensive experiments exhibit better model performance and a substantial reduction in training costs, with a halving of training costs for achieving relatively high accuracy.

Adverse weather significantly degrades image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models, particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios."}

However, when prompts involve multiple objects alongside global or local style instructions, the outputs often drift in style and lose spatial coherence, limiting their reliability for controlled, style-consistent scene generation. We present Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA), a lightweight, training-free method that splits the prompt into content and style tokens, then injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at chosen timesteps. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in the denoising process, LPA improves both layout control and stylistic uniformity without additional training cost. We conduct extensive ablations across parser settings and injection windows, finding that the best configuration -- lpa late only with a 300-650 step window -- delivers the strongest balance of prompt alignment and style consistency. On the T2I benchmark, LPA improves CLIP-prompt alignment over vanilla SDXL by +0.41% and over SD1.5 by +0.34%, with no diversity loss. On our custom 50-prompt style-rich benchmark, LPA achieves +0.09% CLIP-prompt and +0.08% CLIP-style gains over baseline.

These sparse annotations are expanded into dense probabilistic supervision through a differentiable random walk label propagation model, which integrates vesselness cues and tubular continuity priors driven by image data.

In this paper, we show that highly transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model, without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence, as their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these defenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models. This means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their models, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense not only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt, which occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To achieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF). Benefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the framework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles. First, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a poisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an attacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus ensuring the defense remains effective long-term.

The development of radar sensors, known for their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a 12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE. Code:this https URL"}

Through a comprehensive investigation of manga narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these limitations.Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii) comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence, struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal inference across extended sequences.

This substantial divergence in methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth shape manipulation."}

Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality. Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR) video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster.

This results in limited generalization and interpretability, especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings of OBS.

To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image, and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions where it would otherwise be generated.

This study presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization, where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.

We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset, we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face, which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure no identity leakage.

To better utilize the wireless resources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, namely non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models.

While deep learning classification models hold significant promise in this domain, their effectiveness is frequently compromised by limited and imbalanced datasets. This study investigates the impact of three data augmentation strategies including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching (FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA), on enhancing the performance of a ResNet18 classifier.Methods: Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,954 patients across nine medical centers were classified into four categories: Diffuse Goiter (DG), Nodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI). Data augmentation was performed using various SD and FM models, resulting in 18 distinct augmentation scenarios. Each augmented dataset was used to train a ResNet18 classifier. Model performance was assessed using class-wise and average precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and image fidelity metrics (FID and KID).Results: FM-based augmentation outperformed all other methods, achieving the highest classification accuracy and lowest FID/KID scores, indicating both improved model generalization and realistic image synthesis. SD1, combining image and prompt inputs in the inference process, was the most effective SD variant, suggesting that physician-generated prompts provide meaningful clinical context. O+FM+CA yielded the most balanced and robust performance across all classes.Conclusion: Integrating FM and clinically-informed SD augmentation, especially when guided by expert prompts, substantially improves thyroid scintigraphy classification. These findings highlight the importance of leveraging both structured medical input and advanced generative models for more effective training on limited datasets."}

Meanwhile, current adversarial training methods predominantly focus on robustness against adversarial attacks without explicitly leveraging geometric structures in the latent space, usually resulting in reduced accuracy on the original clean data. We propose a novel framework named Adversarially trained Deep Positive-Negative Prototypes (Adv-DPNP), which integrates discriminative prototype-based learning with adversarial training. Adv-DPNP uses unified class prototypes that serve as both classifier weights and robust anchors in the latent space. Moreover, a novel dual-branch training mechanism maintains stable prototypes by updating them exclusively with clean data, while the feature extractor is trained on both clean and adversarial inputs to increase invariance to adversarial perturbations. In addition, we use a composite loss that combines positive-prototype alignment, negative-prototype repulsion, and consistency regularization to further enhance discrimination, adversarial robustness, and clean accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN) confirm that Adv-DPNP improves clean accuracy over state-of-the-art defenses and baseline methods, while maintaining competitive or superior robustness under a suite of widely used attacks, including FGSM, PGD, C\\&W, and AutoAttack.

Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients.

Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting data.

To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for improved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances further enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most relevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques are limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed sequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown beforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently (termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts. This renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially recomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing cross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to reduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of attention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV takes into account the complementary information of other contexts when sparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified information.

The study introduces a lightweight sInvResUNet, along with a collaborative learning scheme named KDCL_sInvResUNet. With only 0.89 million parameters and a computational load of 0.02 GFLOPS, real-time ABP estimation was successfully achieved on embedded devices with an inference time of just 8.49 milliseconds for a 10-second output. We performed subject-independent validation in a large-scale and heterogeneous perioperative dataset containing 1,257,141 data segments from 2,154 patients, with a wide BP range (41-257 mmHg for SBP, and 31-234 mmHg for DBP). The proposed KDCL_sInvResUNet achieved lightly better performance compared to large models, with a mean absolute error of 10.06 mmHg and mean Pearson correlation of 0.88 in tracking ABP changes. Despite these promising results, all deep learning models showed significant performance variations across different demographic and cardiovascular conditions, highlighting their limited ability to generalize across such a broad and diverse population. This study lays a foundation work for real-time, unobtrusive ABP monitoring in real-world perioperative settings, providing baseline for future advancements in this area."}

Existing incremental learning methods focus on task expansion within a single modality, whereas MBIIL seeks to train a unified model incrementally across modalities. The MBIIL faces two challenges: I) How to preserve previously learned knowledge during incremental updates? II) How to effectively leverage knowledge acquired from existing modalities to support new modalities? To address these challenges, we propose MSLoRA-CR, a method that fine-tunes Modality-Specific LoRA modules while incorporating Contrastive Regularization to enhance intra-modality knowledge sharing and promote inter-modality knowledge differentiation. Our approach builds upon a large vision-language model (LVLM), keeping the pretrained model frozen while incrementally adapting new LoRA modules for each modality or task. Experiments on the incremental learning of biomedical images demonstrate that MSLoRA-CR outperforms both the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach of training separate models for each modality and the general incremental learning method (incrementally fine-tuning LoRA). Specifically, MSLoRA-CR achieves a 1.88% improvement in overall performance compared to unconstrained incremental learning methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

However, most neural solvers are trained to tackle VRP instances in a relatively monotonous context, e.g., simplifying VRPs by using Euclidean distance between nodes and adhering to a single problem size, which harms their off-the-shelf application in different scenarios. To enhance their versatility, this paper presents a novel lifelong learning framework that incrementally trains a neural solver to manage VRPs in distinct contexts. Specifically, we propose a lifelong learner (LL), exploiting a Transformer network as the backbone, to solve a series of VRPs. The inter-context self-attention mechanism is proposed within LL to transfer the knowledge obtained from solving preceding VRPs into the succeeding ones. On top of that, we develop a dynamic context scheduler (DCS), employing the cross-context experience replay to further facilitate LL looking back on the attained policies of solving preceding VRPs. Extensive results on synthetic and benchmark instances (problem sizes up to 18k) show that our LL is capable of discovering effective policies for tackling generic VRPs in varying contexts, which outperforms other neural solvers and achieves the best performance for most VRPs."}

Specifically, we first extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs), static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process.

Our process begins by training a foundational model on a general public dataset to establish a competent starting point. This model then undergoes a serial meta-initialization phase, where it sequentially trains on a subset of IOT Device data to learn a heterogeneity-aware initialization that is already situated in a favorable region of the loss landscape. This informed model is subsequently refined in a parallel FL phase, which utilizes a dual-criterion aggregation mechanism that weights for IOT devices updates based on both local performance and cosine similarity alignment.

To address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling (SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the predictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse features at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet complementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the scale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional linear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary using gated wavelet decomposition. Then a novel fusion mechanism is constructed, incorporating a dual-stream independence constraint based on cross-term loss to dynamically refine the dual-stream prediction results, suppress mutual interference, and enhance the accuracy of long-term traffic emission prediction.

HDC is a brain-inspired computing scheme with lightweight training and inference operations, much smaller model size, and robustness to communication noise. FedUHD introduces two novel HDC-based designs to improve UFL performance. On the client side, a kNN-based cluster hypervector removal method addresses non-iid data samples by eliminating detrimental outliers. On the server side, a weighted HDC aggregation technique balances the non-iid data distribution across clients. Our experiments demonstrate that FedUHD achieves up to 173.6x and 612.7x better speedup and energy efficiency, respectively, in training, up to 271x lower communication cost, and 15.50% higher accuracy on average across diverse settings, along with superior robustness to various types of noise compared to state-of-the-art NN-based UFL approaches."}

This approach not only addresses privacy concerns but also allows access to overall substantially larger and potentially more diverse datasets, without the need for centralized storage or hardware resources. However, heterogeneity in client data may cause certain clients to have disproportionate impacts on the global model, leading to disparities in the clients' performances. Fairness, therefore, becomes a crucial concern in FL and can be addressed in various ways. However, the effectiveness of existing fairness-aware methods, particularly in heterogeneous data settings, remains unclear, and the relationships between different approaches are not well understood. In this work, we focus on performance equitable fairness, which aims to minimize differences in performance across clients. We restrict our study to fairness-aware methods that explicitly regularize client losses, evaluating both existing and newly proposed approaches. We identify and theoretically explain connections between the investigated fairness methods, and empirically show that FairGrad (approximate) and FairGrad* (exact) (two variants of a gradient variance regularization method introduced here for performance equitable fairness) improve both fairness and overall model performance in heterogeneous data settings."}

Existing AIGC services usually assume that the accuracy of the generated content can be ensured, given accurate input data and prompt, thus only the content generation quality (CGQ) is concerned. However, it is not applicable in ISAC-based AIGC networks, where content generation is based on inaccurate sensed data. Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation errors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing resources). To assess the quality of experience of ISAC-based AIGC services, we propose a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA). Since allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content accuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this sensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource tradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all users with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC). This problem is NP-hard, with a large solution space that grows exponentially with users. To solve the CAQA-AIGC problem with low complexity, a linear programming (LP) guided deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Through the LP-guided approach and the action filter, LPDRL-F can transform the original three-dimensional solution space to two dimensions, reducing complexity while improving the learning performance of DRL. Simulations show that compared to existing DRL and generative diffusion model algorithms without LP, LPDRL-F converges faster by over 60% and finds better resource allocation solutions, improving AvgCAQA by more than 14%. With LPDRL-F, CAQA-AIGC can achieve an improvement in AvgCAQA of more than 50% compared to existing schemes focusing solely on CGQ."}

By deriving exact Jacobians for leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes explicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in parameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control memory retention in the hidden states, but also act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as Adam, showing that these optimization behaviors emerge naturally from gating. Numerical experiments confirm the validity of our perturbative analysis, supporting the view that gate-induced corrections remain small while exerting systematic effects on training dynamics. Overall, this work provides a unified dynamical-systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with parameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust trainability and stability in practice."}

While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal protein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The concatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the protein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between modalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window, ProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it incompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its generalization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a lightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under few-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that fuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively reducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then we propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration into the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average demonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the original ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of approximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting. Without modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number of additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding compression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the self-compression stage. Extensive experiments on protein function prediction show that ProtTeX-CC improves performance on the in-domain benchmark by 2%, and generalizes well to the out-of-domain dataset with a performance gain of 11%."}

We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns.

To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings."}

We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that replaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an ONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features (age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT), and requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers immediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying NGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained object earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against LRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial workloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538, a 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from 0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods (about 0.918).

For this reason, several methods have been proposed to guarantee latent identifiability, which is the key to avoiding posterior collapse. However, they require structural constraints on the network architecture. For further clarification, we define local posterior collapse to reflect the importance of individual sample points in the data space and to relax the network constraint. Then, we propose Latent Reconstruction(LR) loss, which is inspired by mathematical properties of injective and composite functions, to control posterior collapse without restriction to a specific architecture. We experimentally evaluate our approach, which controls posterior collapse on varied datasets such as MNIST, fashionMNIST, Omniglot, CelebA, and FFHQ."}

By properly selecting key training hyper-parameters, e.g., learning rate, batch size, and gradient steps, we reduce unsafe model responses from 16\\% to approximately 5\\%, as measured by keyword matching, while maintaining utility performance.

The current approach of manually inspecting individual outputs is inefficient, making it difficult to track code evolution, compare coding iterations, and identify improvement opportunities. To address this challenge, we introduce a visual analytics system designed to enhance the examination of coding agent behaviors. Focusing on the AIDE framework, our system supports comparative analysis across three levels: (1) Code-Level Analysis, which reveals how the agent debugs and refines its code over iterations; (2) Process-Level Analysis, which contrasts different solution-seeking processes explored by the agent; and (3) LLM-Level Analysis, which highlights variations in coding behavior across different LLMs. By integrating these perspectives, our system enables ML scientists to gain a structured understanding of agent behaviors, facilitating more effective debugging and prompt engineering.

When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics.

Criteria for robust explanations in XAI", "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) algorithms are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life and in scientific research. However, the price we pay for their impressively accurate predictions is significant: their inner workings are notoriously opaque - it is unknown to laypeople and researchers alike what features of the data a DL system focuses on and how it ultimately succeeds in predicting correct outputs. A necessary criterion for trustworthy explanations is that they should reflect the relevant processes the algorithms' predictions are based on. The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) presents promising methods to create such explanations. But recent reviews about their performance offer reasons for skepticism. As we will argue, a good criterion for trustworthiness is explanatory robustness: different XAI methods produce the same explanations in comparable contexts. However, in some instances, all methods may give the same, but still wrong, explanation. We therefore argue that in addition to explanatory robustness (ER), a prior requirement of explanation method robustness (EMR) has to be fulfilled by every XAI method. Conversely, the robustness of an individual method is in itself insufficient for trustworthiness. In what follows, we develop and formalize criteria for ER as well as EMR, providing a framework for explaining and establishing trust in DL algorithms. We also highlight interesting application cases and outline directions for future work."}

Although DiffAN addresses these limitations by substituting kernel-based estimates with diffusion models, it remains numerically unstable due to the second-order derivatives of score models.

This paper presents FedSODA, a resource-efficient FFT framework that enables clients to adapt LLMs without accessing or storing the full model. Specifically, we first propose a similarity group pruning (SGP) module, which prunes redundant layers from the full LLM while retaining the most critical layers to preserve the model performance.

Therefore, automating the design of SpTA accelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either mapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or sparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to suboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A unified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed.

Split learning (SL) offers a promising solution by offloading the primary computing load from edge devices to a server via model partitioning. However, as the number of participating devices increases, the transmission of excessive smashed data (i.e., activations and gradients) becomes a major bottleneck for SL, slowing down the model training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a communication-efficient SL framework, named SL-ACC, which comprises two key components: adaptive channel importance identification (ACII) and channel grouping compression (CGC). ACII first identifies the contribution of each channel in the smashed data to model training using Shannon entropy. Following this, CGC groups the channels based on their entropy and performs group-wise adaptive compression to shrink the transmission volume without compromising training accuracy. Extensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed SL-ACC framework takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy than state-of-the-art benchmarks."}

This motivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML) problem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning (FAML).

Threat Modeling, that is, comprehending the consequences of these attacks, can provide critical support to cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to take timely action and allocate resources that could be used elsewhere. Cybersecurity is heavily dependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and mitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Recently, there has been a pressing need for automated methods to assess attack descriptions and forecast the future consequences of the increasing complexity of cyberattacks. This study examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning can be applied to analyze the potential impact of cyberattacks by leveraging textual descriptions from the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database. We emphasize classifying attack consequences into five principal categories: Availability, Access Control, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Other. This paper investigates the use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in combination with Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) for Multi-label classification, evaluating their performance in comparison with conventional CNN and LSTM-based models. Experimental findings show that BERT achieves an overall accuracy of $0.972$, far higher than conventional deep learning models in multi-label classification.

This urgency is reflected in emerging global regulations that mandate fairness assessments and independent bias audits. However, procuring the necessary complete data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge. In industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data. In practice, data relevant for fairness testing is often split across separate sources: internal datasets held by institutions with predictive attributes, and external public datasets such as census data containing protected attributes, each providing only partial, marginal information. Our work seeks to leverage such available separate data to estimate model fairness when complete data is inaccessible. We propose utilising the available separate data to estimate a set of feasible joint distributions and then compute the set plausible fairness metrics. Through simulation and real experiments, we demonstrate that we can derive meaningful bounds on fairness metrics and obtain reliable estimates of the true metric. Our results demonstrate that this approach can serve as a practical and effective solution for fairness testing in real-world settings where access to complete data is restricted."}

Levine,Matthew Berger", "title": "Seeing the Many: Exploring Parameter Distributions Conditioned on Features in Surrogates", "abstract": "Recently, neural surrogate models have emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional simulation workflows. This is accomplished by modeling the underlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run expensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output, surrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input parameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find parameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding these parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter spaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a small set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader picture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the distribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature. To achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation error inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter distribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation, reporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to training parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density estimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a likelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter configurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the usability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing feature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three simulation datasets.

Calibration measures quantify how far a predictor is from perfect calibration. As introduced by Haghtalab et al. (2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized in expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities. Although predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, in reality, when calibration is evaluated on a finite sample, predicting the truth is not guaranteed to minimize any known calibration measure. All known calibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more calibrated on a finite sample. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et al. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful calibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly truthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch setting.We design a perfectly truthful calibration measure in the batch setting: averaged two-bin calibration error (ATB). In addition to being truthful, ATB is sound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing calibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower) distance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB makes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation algorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal, achieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing problem studied by Hu et al.

We also introduce a general recipe for constructing truthful measures, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a special case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures such as quantile-binned l_2-ECE."}

To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias. The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial complexities.

To address this, we introduce Combinatorial Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the Rubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial states and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS, though with longer solutions.

In this paper, we focus on an underexplored problem in human mobility prediction: determining the best practices to train a machine learning model using historical data to forecast an individuals complete trajectory over the next days and weeks. In this experiment paper, we undertake a comprehensive experimental analysis of diverse models, parameter configurations, and training strategies, accompanied by an in-depth examination of the statistical distribution inherent in human mobility patterns.

Moreover, since the absence of explicit user information is often missing due to user privacy, we show that the sampling of users may exacerbate data skewness and result in a substantial loss in predictive accuracy. To mitigate data imbalance and preserve diversity, we apply user semantic clustering with stratified sampling to ensure that the sampled dataset remains representative.

Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we refer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains when combined with MDPO.

In recent years, the introduction of deep learning technology has greatly promoted the development of the field of emotion recognition. However, due to physiological differences between subjects, as well as the variations in experimental environments and equipment, cross-corpus emotion recognition faces serious challenges, especially for samples near the decision boundary. To solve the above problems, we propose an optimization method based on domain adversarial transfer learning to fine-grained alignment of affective features, named Maximum classifier discrepancy with Pairwise Learning (McdPL) framework. In McdPL, we design a dual adversarial classifier (Ada classifier and RMS classifier), and apply a three-stage adversarial training to maximize classification discrepancy and minimize feature distribution to align controversy samples near the decision boundary. In the process of domain adversarial training, the two classifiers also maintain an adversarial relationship, ultimately enabling precise cross-corpus feature alignment. In addition, the introduction of pairwise learning transforms the classification problem of samples into a similarity problem between samples, alleviating the influence of label noise. We conducted systematic experimental evaluation of the model using publicly available SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V databases. The results show that the McdPL model is superior to other baseline models in the cross-corpus emotion recognition task, and the average accuracy improvements of 4.76\\% and 3.97\\%, respectively. Our work provides a promising solution for emotion recognition cross-corpus. The source code is available atthis https URL."}

Two windowing strategies are introduced: (1) a 5-minute window with 30-second steps for machine-learning models that use handcrafted features, and (2) a 30-second window with 10-second steps for deep-learning models, enabling near-real-time 10-second resolution.

We therefore design SleepLiteCNN, a custom model that achieves 89 percent accuracy and 89 percent F1-score while lowering energy use to 5.48 microjoules per inference at 45 nm.

Multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN) have the capability of integrating diverse data domains and offer a promising solution for robust and accurate predictions. However, the optimal fusion strategy, intermediate fusion (feature-level) versus late fusion (decision-level) remains insufficiently examined, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts such as ECG-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification. This study investigates the comparative effectiveness of intermediate and late fusion strategies using ECG signals across three domains: time, frequency, and time-frequency. A series of experiments were conducted to identify the highest-performing fusion architecture. Results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperformed late fusion, achieving a peak accuracy of 97 percent, with Cohen's d > 0.8 relative to standalone models and d = 0.40 compared to late fusion. Interpretability analyses using saliency maps reveal that both models align with the discretized ECG signals. Statistical dependency between the discretized ECG signals and corresponding saliency maps for each class was confirmed using Mutual Information (MI).

This paper introduces a generalizable unsupervised deep manifold learning for exploration of neurocognitive and behavioral patterns. Unlike existing methods that extract patterns directly from the input data as in the existing methods, the proposed Brain-dynamic Convolutional-Network-based Embedding (BCNE) seeks to capture the brain-state trajectories by deciphering the temporospatial correlations within the data and subsequently applying manifold learning to this correlative representation. The performance of BCNE is showcased through the analysis of several important dynamic brain datasets. The results, both visual and quantitative, reveal a diverse array of intriguing and interpretable patterns.

However, they often suffer from limited annotated data, highlighting the need for a general-purpose bioacoustic encoder capable of extracting useful representations for diverse downstream tasks. Such encoders have been proposed before, but are often limited in scope due to a focus on a narrow range of species (typically birds), and a reliance on a single model architecture or training paradigm. Moreover, they are usually evaluated on a small set of tasks and datasets. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical study that covers aspects of bioacoustics that are relevant to research but have previously been scarcely considered: training data diversity and scale, model architectures and training recipes, and the breadth of evaluation tasks and datasets. We obtain encoders that are state-of-the-art on the existing and proposed benchmarks. We also identify what matters for training these encoders, such that this work can be extended when more data are available or better architectures are proposed.

Our approach is computationally fast and easy to adopt. When we apply our method to matchups from two popular human-preference platforms, Chatbot Arena and MT-Bench, we find that the Bradley--Terry rankings of top-performing models are remarkably sensitive to the removal of a small fraction of evaluations. Our framework also identifies the specific evaluations most responsible for such ranking flips, allowing for inspections of these influential preferences. We observe that the rankings derived from MT-Bench preferences are notably more robust than those from Chatbot Arena, likely due to MT-bench's use of expert annotators and carefully constructed prompts. Finally, we find that rankings based on crowdsourced human-evaluated systems are just as sensitive as those based on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations, where in both, dropping as little as 0.02% of the total evaluations in the dataset can change the top-ranked model."}

Key paradigms in distributed QML include federated learning, which, similar to classical models, involves training a shared model on local data and sending only the model updates, as well as circuit distribution methods inherent to quantum computing, such as circuit cutting and teleportation-based techniques.

Sparsity ensures communication overhead remains low, while reliable connectivity is tied to reliable communication and inference on decentralized data reservoirs and computational resources. A class of network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to balance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust, e.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are deployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network parameters in response to different operational requirements, including the need to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic and adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to inform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in regimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and lower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the number of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a stronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the presence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based on pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial nodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics that are closely tied to privacy guarantees. Together, our results pave the way for end-to-end performance guarantees for a suite of algorithms for reliable inference on networks."}

For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks.

Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage."}

To our knowledge,transfer learning and subsampling under data contamination have not been thoroughly investigated.

We address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment, which \\textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to maintain state uncertainty \\textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error. Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion (B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online, optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth.

In this study, we present a lightweight AI assistant that interprets Skew-T diagrams using a small language model (LM) and a small VLM fine-tuned to emulate human forecasters. Using a curriculum learning framework, we first train the models to identify key atmospheric features from diagrams through visual question answering, followed by chain-of-thought reasoning tasks that estimate precipitation probability based on the derived visual groundings.

The main concern is the lack of explainability of these trained ML models and the significant risks posed to network functionalities in case of failures, especially since (i) testing on every exhaustive case is infeasible and (ii) the data used for model training may not be available. This paper proposes ATLAS, an AI-guided approach that generates a battery of tests for pre-trained AI-native receiver models and benchmarks the performance against a classical receiver architecture. Using gradient-based optimization, it avoids spanning the exhaustive set of all environment and channel conditions; instead, it generates the next test in an online manner to further probe specific configurations that offer the highest risk of failure. We implement and validate our approach by adopting the well-known DeepRx AI-native receiver model as well as a classical receiver using differentiable tensors in NVIDIA's Sionna environment. ATLAS uncovers specific combinations of mobility, channel delay spread, and noise, where fully and partially trained variants of AI-native DeepRx perform suboptimally compared to the classical receivers. Our proposed method reduces the number of tests required per failure found by 19% compared to grid search for a 3-parameters input optimization problem, demonstrating greater efficiency.

We present an analysis explaining why it is not straightforward to convert an encoder-decoder transformer to a low-latency streaming model.

Indeed, this makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces (Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while maintaining computational efficiency.

However, identifying the precise mechanisms or internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse, distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs, especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs during in-context learning.

Rather than projecting visual features to text space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%).

With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these phenomena.

The resulting unambiguous delay-Doppler-time features enable robust sensing with compact neural networks. Extensive experiments show that WiDFS 3.0 achieves accurate parameter estimation, with performance comparable to or even surpassing that of prior multi-antenna methods, especially in delay estimation. Validated under single- and multi-target scenarios, the extracted ambiguity-resolved features show strong sensing accuracy and generalization. For example, when deployed on the embedded-friendly MobileViT-XXS with only 1.3M parameters, WiDFS 3.0 consistently outperforms conventional features such as CSI amplitude, mirrored Doppler, and multi-receiver aggregated Doppler."}

Although association studies utilizing the new sequencing technologies hold great promise to unravel novel genetic variants, especially rare genetic variants that contribute to human diseases, the statistical analysis of high-dimensional sequencing data remains a challenge. Advanced analytical methods are in great need to facilitate high-dimensional sequencing data analyses. In this article, we propose a generalized genetic random field (GGRF) method for association analyses of sequencing data. Like other similarity-based methods (e.g., SIMreg and SKAT), the new method has the advantages of avoiding the need to specify thresholds for rare variants and allowing for testing multiple variants acting in different directions and magnitude of effects. The method is built on the generalized estimating equation framework and thus accommodates a variety of disease phenotypes (e.g., quantitative and binary phenotypes). Moreover, it has a nice asymptotic property, and can be applied to small-scale sequencing data without need for small-sample adjustment. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed GGRF attains an improved or comparable power over a commonly used method, SKAT, under various disease scenarios, especially when rare variants play a significant role in disease etiology. We further illustrate GGRF with an application to a real dataset from the Dallas Heart Study. By using GGRF, we were able to detect the association of two candidate genes, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, with serum triglyceride."}

Within this framework, we study the relationship between the quasi-stationary distribution derived from this equation and the initial distribution through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As the quasi-steady-state distribution depends on the expected cost function, the KL divergence eventually reveals the connection between the expected cost function and the initialization distribution. By applying this to deep neural network models (DNNs), we can express the bounds of the expected loss function explicitly in terms of the initialization parameters. Then, by minimizing this bound, we obtain an optimal condition of the initialization variance in the Gaussian case. This result provides a concrete mathematical criterion, rather than a heuristic approach, to select the scale of weight initialization in DNNs. In addition, we experimentally confirm our theoretical results by using the classical SGD to train fully connected neural networks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The result shows that if the variance of the initialization distribution satisfies our theoretical optimal condition, then the corresponding DNN model always achieves lower final training loss and higher test accuracy than the conventional He-normal initialization.

We present a streamlined, fully automated framework for fiber bundle segmentation in macaque tracer data, based on a U-Net architecture with large patch sizes, foreground aware sampling, and semisupervised pre-training. Our approach eliminates common errors such as mislabeling terminals as bundles, improves detection of sparse bundles by over 20% and reduces the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by 40% compared to the state-of-the-art, all while enabling analysis of standalone slices. This new framework will facilitate the automated analysis of anatomic tracing data at a large scale, generating more ground-truth data that can be used to validate and optimize dMRI tractography methods."}

This paper introduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time, adaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided actor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments. Its key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action sub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency. Training occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers State, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is built on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost, Scalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500 unseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible inefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch, the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring Dashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This work presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing how context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and measurable human impact."}

We present a generative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large, nonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates the inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric descriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based representations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these configurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and postprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation setup, and descriptor extraction methods.

In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark more reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality evaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in current benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models from worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability between training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better signal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale, and those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These results suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful benchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect signal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has better signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better reliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy subtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable multi-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's intermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We conclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which existing benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise.

Introducing these non-ideal device behaviors in DNN training enhances robustness, but drawbacks include limited accuracy improvement, reduced prediction confidence, and convergence issues. This arises from a mismatch between the deterministic training and non-deterministic device variations, as such training, though considering variations, relies solely on the model's final output.

We instantiate this concept with two specific instances, oriented variational forward (OVF) and intermediate representation snapshot (IRS). Based on device variation models extracted from measured data, extensive experiments show that our NeFT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with up to a 45.08% improvement in inference accuracy while reducing epistemic uncertainty, boosting output confidence, and improving convergence probability.

Such large models incur high memory usage, latency, and computational costs, thereby restricting their inference deployment. GNN compression techniques compress large GNNs into smaller ones with negligible accuracy loss. One of the most promising compression techniques is knowledge distillation (KD). However, most KD approaches for GNNs only consider the outputs of the last layers and do not consider the outputs of the intermediate layers of the GNNs. The intermediate layers may contain important inductive biases indicated by the graph structure and embeddings. Ignoring these layers may lead to a high accuracy drop, especially when the compression ratio is high. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel KD approach for GNN compression that we call Structure and Embedding Distillation with Attention (STRIDE). STRIDE utilizes attention to identify important intermediate teacher-student layer pairs and focuses on using those pairs to align graph structure and node embeddings. We evaluate STRIDE on several datasets, such as OGBN-Mag and OGBN-Arxiv, using different model architectures, including GCNIIs, RGCNs, and GraphSAGE. On average, STRIDE achieves a 2.13% increase in accuracy with a 32.3X compression ratio on OGBN-Mag, a large graph dataset, compared to state-of-the-art approaches. On smaller datasets (e.g., Pubmed), STRIDE achieves up to a 141X compression ratio with the same accuracy as state-of-the-art approaches.

Theoretically, our analysis establishes connections between the solutions of linear TD learning and ordinary least squares (OLS). Under specific conditions -- particularly when the noise is correlated -- the TD solution serves as a more effective estimator than OLS. Furthermore, we show that when our algorithm is applied with many commonly used loss functions -- such as those found in generalized linear models -- it corresponds to the application of a novel and generalized Bellman operator. We prove that this operator admits a unique fixed point, and based on this, we establish convergence guarantees for our generalized TD algorithm under linear function approximation.

A constrained clustering algorithm, which leverages linear programming to control the size, label, and (optionally) group distributions of the splits, is presented. The algorithm does not require additional metadata, and comes with convergence guarantees. In experiments, the technique consistently outperforms alternative splitting strategies across a range of datasets and training algorithms, for both domain generalisation and unsupervised domain adaptation tasks. Analysis also shows the MMD between the training and validation sets to be well-correlated with test domain accuracy, further substantiating the validity of this approach."}

We identify limitations in current approaches, noting that several methods perform inadequately as unlearners and that existing evaluation tools insufficiently validate unlearning effects in contrastive learning. To address these issues, we propose Alignment Calibration (AC), a novel method that explicitly considers contrastive learning properties and optimizes towards new auditing metrics for easy verification of unlearning.

However, translating natural language instructions into effective robotic control policies remains a significant challenge, especially for tasks requiring long-horizon planning and operating under sparse reward conditions. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) provides a natural framework to address this challenge in robotics; however, it typically suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, destabilizing higher-level policy learning. We introduce LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages LLMs to generate language-guided reward functions for the higher-level policy. By decoupling high-level reward generation from low-level policy changes, LGR2 fundamentally mitigates the non-stationarity problem in off-policy HRL, enabling stable and efficient learning. To further enhance sample efficiency in sparse environments, we integrate goal-conditioned hindsight experience relabeling. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world robotic navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate LGR2 outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, achieving over 55% success rates on challenging tasks and robust transfer to real robots, without additional fine-tuning."}

While such an ultimate goal is inspired by the human hallmark of continuous real-time processing of sensory information, several solutions have simplified the learning paradigm by artificially limiting the processed context or dealing with sequences of limited length, given in advance. These solutions were further emphasized by the ubiquity of Transformers, which initially overshadowed the role of Recurrent Neural Nets.

The fast development of Large Language Models has renewed the interest in efficient solutions to process data over time. This survey provides an in-depth summary of the latest approaches that are based on recurrent models for sequential data processing. A complete taxonomy of recent trends in architectural and algorithmic solutions is reported and discussed, guiding researchers in this appealing research field.

Emissions-reducing interventions on coal-fired power plants -- a major source of hazardous air pollution -- have proven to be an effective, but costly, strategy for reducing pollution-related health burdens.

The primary difficulty lies in quantifying the health benefits of intervening at particular plants. This is further complicated because interventions are applied on power plants, while health impacts occur in potentially distant communities, a setting known as bipartite network interference (BNI). In this paper, we introduce novel policy learning methods based on Q- and A-Learning to determine the optimal policy under arbitrary BNI. We derive asymptotic properties and demonstrate finite sample efficacy in simulations. We apply our novel methods to a comprehensive dataset of Medicare claims, power plant data, and pollution transport networks.

One proposed benefit of this model is to allow agents to model the attention states of other agents, and thus predict and interact with other agents. The effects of an attention schema may be examined in artificial agents. Although attention mechanisms in artificial agents are different from in biological brains, there may be some principles in common. In both cases, select features or representations are emphasized for better performance. Here, using neural networks with transformer attention mechanisms, we asked whether the addition of an attention schema affected the ability of agents to make judgements about and cooperate with each other. First, we found that an agent with an attention schema is better at categorizing the attention states of other agents (higher accuracy). Second, an agent with an attention schema develops a pattern of attention that is easier for other agents to categorize. Third, in a joint task where two agents must predict each other to paint a scene together, adding an attention schema improves performance. Finally, the performance improvements are not caused by a general increase in network complexity. Instead, improvement is specific to tasks involving judging, categorizing, or predicting the attention of other agents. These results support the hypothesis that an attention schema has computational properties beneficial to mutual interpretability and interactive behavior.

Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models.

SARSA is a widely used on-policy RL method that enhances action-value functions via temporal difference updates.

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a promising solution, enabling on-the-fly model adaptation without access to source data. However, its effectiveness degrades significantly in the presence of complex, mixed distribution shifts - common in practical settings - where multiple latent domains coexist. Adapting under such intrinsic heterogeneity, especially in unlabeled and online conditions, remains an open and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we study TTA under mixed distribution shifts and move beyond conventional homogeneous adaptation paradigms. By revisiting TTA from a frequency-domain perspective, we observe that distribution heterogeneity often manifests in Fourier space - for instance, high-frequency components tend to carry domain-specific variations. This motivates us to perform domain-aware separation using high-frequency texture cues, making diverse shift patterns more tractable. To this end, we propose FreDA, a novel Frequency-based Decentralized Adaptation framework that decomposes globally heterogeneous data into locally homogeneous components in the frequency domain. It further employs decentralized learning and augmentation strategies to robustly adapt under complex, evolving shifts.

Additionally we provide insights into popular information-theoretic quantities, showing they can be poor estimators of what they are often purported to measure, while also explaining how they can still be useful in guiding data acquisition."}

In this work, we interpret Neural Network (NN) solutions to sequence based number tasks using a variety of methods to understand how well we can interpret them through the lens of interpretable Symbolic Algorithms (SAs) -- precise programs describable by rules and typed, mutable variables. We use autoregressive GRUs, LSTMs, and Transformers trained on tasks where the correct tokens depend on numeric information only latent in the task structure. We show through multiple causal and theoretical methods that we can interpret raw NN activity through the lens of simplified SAs when we frame the activity in terms of neural subspaces rather than individual neurons. Using Distributed Alignment Search (DAS), we find that, depending on network architecture, dimensionality, and task specifications, alignments with SA's can be very high, or they can be only approximate, or fail altogether. We extend our analytic toolkit to address the failure cases by expanding the DAS framework to a broader class of alignment functions that more flexibly capture NN activity in terms of interpretable variables from SAs, and we provide theoretic and empirical explorations of Linear Alignment Functions (LAFs) in contrast to the preexisting Orthogonal Alignment Functions (OAFs). Through analyses of specific cases we confirm the usefulness of causal interventions on neural subspaces for NN interpretability, and we show that recurrent models can develop graded, symbol-like number variables in their neural activity. We further show that shallow Transformers learn very different solutions than recurrent networks, and we prove that such models must use anti-Markovian solutions -- solutions that do not rely on cumulative, Markovian hidden states -- in the absence of sufficient attention layers."}

In this work, we propose reverse Markov learning (RML), a framework that defines a general forward process transitioning from the target distribution to a known distribution (e.g., Gaussian) and then learns a reverse Markov process using multiple engression models. This reverse process reconstructs the target distribution step by step. This framework accommodates general forward processes, allows for dimension reduction, and naturally discretizes the generative process. In the special case of diffusion-based forward processes, RML provides an efficient discretization strategy for both training and inference in diffusion models. We further introduce an alternating sampling scheme to enhance post-training performance. Our statistical analysis establishes error bounds for RML and elucidates its advantages in estimation efficiency and flexibility in forward process design.

By employing a pre-trained encoder-decoder and a state-dependent linear system, our approach enables interpretability through local stability analysis, where instantaneous growth in action-norms can be predicted before their execution. We demonstrate that SALSA-RL can be deployed in a non-invasive manner for assessing the local stability of actions from pretrained RL agents without compromising on performance across diverse benchmark environments.

However, Sinkhorn has quadratic space and time complexity in the number of points, limiting scalability to larger datasets. Low-rank OT achieves linear complexity, but by definition, cannot compute a one-to-one correspondence between points. When the optimal transport problem is an assignment problem between datasets then an optimal mapping, known as the Monge map, is guaranteed to be a bijection. In this setting, we show that the factors of an optimal low-rank coupling co-cluster each point with its image under the Monge map. We leverage this invariant to derive an algorithm, Hierarchical Refinement (HiRef), that dynamically constructs a multiscale partition of each dataset using low-rank OT subproblems, culminating in the bijective Monge map. Hierarchical Refinement runs in log-linear time and linear space, retaining the advantages of low-rank OT while overcoming its limited resolution.

In this paper, we introduce MedSpaformer, a transformer-based framework tailored for MedTS classification. It incorporates a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global context modeling and token sparsification, allowing dynamic feature refinement by focusing on informative tokens while reducing redundancy. This mechanism is integrated into a multi-granularity cross-channel encoding scheme to capture intra- and inter-granularity temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations, enabling progressive refinement of task-relevant patterns in medical signals. The sparsification design allows our model to flexibly accommodate inputs with variable lengths and channel dimensions. We also introduce an adaptive label encoder to extract label semantics and address cross-dataset label space misalignment. Together, these components enhance the model's transferability across heterogeneous medical datasets, which helps alleviate the challenge of label scarcity. Our model outperforms 13 baselines across 7 medical datasets under supervised learning. It also excels in few-shot learning and demonstrates zero-shot capability in both in-domain and cross-domain diagnostics.

Given the stacked structure of neural networks, where each block builds on the representation of the block below, this approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features live on the top blocks of the model, while features on lower blocks are expected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning method named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards propagation across the entire network. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods, where each block independently learns to denoise a noisy target using only local targets and back-propagation within the block. We believe this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of learning methods that does not learn hierarchical representations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the representation at each block beforehand to a noised version of the target, learning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks. Our results show that NoProp is a viable learning algorithm, is easy to use and computationally efficient. By departing from the traditional learning paradigm which requires back-propagating a global error signal, NoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more efficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other characteristics of the learning process."}

Adv-DPNP uses unified class prototypes that serve as both classifier weights and robust anchors in the latent space. Moreover, a novel dual-branch training mechanism maintains stable prototypes by updating them exclusively with clean data, while the feature extractor is trained on both clean and adversarial inputs to increase invariance to adversarial perturbations. In addition, we use a composite loss that combines positive-prototype alignment, negative-prototype repulsion, and consistency regularization to further enhance discrimination, adversarial robustness, and clean accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN) confirm that Adv-DPNP improves clean accuracy over state-of-the-art defenses and baseline methods, while maintaining competitive or superior robustness under a suite of widely used attacks, including FGSM, PGD, C\\&W, and AutoAttack.

However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method.

Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum multiple individual rewards, \\eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches. Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion.

Training with large mini-batch sizes enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to 300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark, outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin.

We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients.

Our analysis reveals that, compared to zero initialization, simultaneously initializing $A$ and $B$ to non-zero values improves LoRA's robustness to suboptimal learning rates, particularly smaller ones. Further analysis indicates that although the non-zero initialization of $AB$ introduces random noise into the pretrained weight, it generally does not affect fine-tuning performance.

However, scaling these discoveries to industrial production remains a major bottleneck due to the synthesis gap -- the need to develop entirely new manufacturing processes. This challenge requires detailed engineering blueprints: PFDs for equipment layouts and material/energy flows, and PIDs for process plant operations. Current AI systems cannot yet reliably generate these critical engineering schematics, creating a fundamental obstacle to manufacturing scale-up of novel discoveries. We present a closed-loop, physics-aware framework for automated generation of industrially viable PFDs and PIDs. The framework integrates three key components: (1) domain-specialized small language models (SLMs) trained for auto-generation of PFDs and PIDs, (2) a hierarchical knowledge graph containing process flow and instrumentation descriptions for 1,020+ chemicals for Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG), and (3) an open-source chemical process simulator for modeling, simulation, optimization, and analysis of novel chemical processes. The SLMs are trained through a multi-stage pipeline on synthetic datasets, with process simulator-in-the-loop validation ensuring feasibility. To enhance computational efficiency, the framework implements structural pruning (width and depth) guided by importance heuristics to reduce language model size while preserving accuracy, followed by advanced inference optimizations including FlashAttention, Lookahead Decoding, PagedAttention with KV-cache quantization, and Test-Time Inference Scaling. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework generates simulator-validated process descriptions with high fidelity."}

In this work, we propose to unlock generalizable learning of graph with post-training alignment with synthetic data. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in direct fine-tuning, we posit that post-training alignment would help LLMs grasp the essentials underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting on synthetic data. We employ post-training alignment algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our post-training alignment recipe leads to statistically significant improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9% over baseline settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently outperform solution-based rewards on synthetic data but not on real-world tasks, and compositionality and explainable intermediate steps remains a critical challenge even after post-training alignment."}

However, how to query, select, and retrieve policies from a pool of agents, and how to integrate such policies remains a largely unexplored area. This study explores how an agent decides what knowledge to select, from whom, and when and how to integrate it in its own policy in order to accelerate its own learning. The proposed algorithm, \\emph{Modular Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning} (MOSAIC), improves learning in agentic collectives by combining (1) knowledge selection using performance signals and cosine similarity on Wasserstein task embeddings, (2) modular and transferable neural representations via masks, and (3) policy integration, composition and fine-tuning. MOSAIC outperforms isolated learners and global sharing approaches in both learning speed and overall performance, and in some cases solves tasks that isolated agents cannot.

One of the main approaches involves measuring the heavytailness of the empirical spectral densities (ESDs) of weight matrices. This analysis has been shown to provide insights to help diagnose whether a model is well-trained or undertrained, and has been used to guide training methods involving layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. In this paper, we address an often-overlooked challenge in estimating the heavytailness of these ESDs: the impact of the aspect ratio of weight matrices. We demonstrate that matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias in estimating the heavytailness of ESDs, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD of these subsampled submatrices. We show that this method effectively mitigates the aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models, scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model (LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. In one of the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model by 17.3% when compared with state-of-the-art methods."}

In particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and overtaking.

However, this structure is lost if any observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods.

Adding model diversity quantified as normalised Shannon entropy produces a dual signal explaining agreement almost completely (R-squared=0.979), though this high predictive power likely reflects task simplicity for current LLMs. The framework enables a three-tier workflow auto-accepting 35 percent of segments with less than 5 percent error, cutting manual effort by 65 percent. Cross-domain validation confirms transferability (kappa improvements of 0.20 to 0.78). While establishing a methodological foundation for AI judgement calibration, the true potential likely lies in more challenging scenarios where LLMs may demonstrate comparative advantages over human cognitive limitations."}

To break this ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model), and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\\pm i$, the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically, our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity $\\{\\pm1, \\pm i\\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically optimal 2-bit representation.

Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel, scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085 photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period (2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000 individual markings, which were then labeled and described using state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring \"signature markings\" that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are unavailable.

This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties trust that the provided attributions are indeed \"good,\" especially when they are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that are {\\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean Squared Error) with probability 1-{\\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with probability {\\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must perform, scales only as O(1/{\\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them broadly applicable to various attribution tasks."}

While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task.

Previous NFP methods have shown LLMs' awareness of their knowledge, but they face challenges in terms of efficiency and transferability. In this work, we propose a lightweight model named Factuality Lens (FacLens), which effectively probes hidden representations of fact-seeking questions for the NFP task. Moreover, we discover that hidden question representations sourced from different LLMs exhibit similar NFP patterns, enabling the transferability of FacLens across different LLMs to reduce development costs.

Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) is a widely used method in language models that encodes relative positions through fixed, block-diagonal, rotation matrices applied to key-query interactions. We hypothesize that this inductive bias limits their RoPE's effectiveness for modalities with high dimensional structure. Lie Relative Encodings (LieRE) introduce a principled generalization of RoPE, aimed at increasing the representational capacity of positional encodings in transformers. Instead of fixed 2D rotations, LieRE learns dense skew-symmetric matrices (Lie algebra elements), which are then differentiable mapped to form high-dimensional rotation matrices (Lie group elements). This results in richer, learnable, and continuous, encodings of both relative and absolute positional information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LieRE on 2D and 3D vision tasks, showing that it generalizes well to higher input resolutions while maintaining computational efficiency.

Optimality is determined based on the multinomial likelihood within which probabilities are estimated using the Naive Bayes factorisation of the projected data. Projection pursuit offers the added benefits of dimension reduction and visualisation. We discuss an intuitive connection with class conditional independent components analysis, and show how this is realised visually in practical applications. The performance of the resulting classification models is investigated using a large collection of (162) publicly available benchmark data sets and in comparison with relevant alternatives.

One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack.

One fundamental limitation is the nature of the cross-entropy (CE) loss, which assumes a nominal scale and thus cannot convey proximity between generated number tokens. In response, we here present a regression-like loss that operates purely on token level. Our proposed Number Token Loss (NTL) comes in two flavors and minimizes either the $L_p$ norm or the Wasserstein distance between the numerical values of the real and predicted number tokens. NTL can easily be added to any language model and extend the CE objective during training without runtime overhead. We evaluate the proposed scheme on various mathematical datasets and find that it consistently improves performance in math-related tasks. In a direct comparison on a regression task, we find that NTL can match the performance of a regression head, despite operating on token level. Finally, we scale NTL up to 3B parameter models and observe improved performance, demonstrating its potential for seamless integration into LLMs. We hope to inspire LLM developers to improve their pretraining objectives and distribute NTL as a minimalistic and lightweight PyPI package $ntloss$:this https URL.

Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the \"sub\"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content.

This paper introduces a novel approach based on the Rashomon perspective, which considers multiple models that achieve similar performance rather than relying on a single best model. This enables uncertainty quantification in survival probability predictions and enhances decision-making in predictive maintenance. The Rashomon survival curve was introduced to represent the range of survival probability estimates, providing insights into model agreement and uncertainty over time. The results on the CMAPSS dataset demonstrate that relying solely on a single model for RUL estimation may increase risk in some scenarios. The censoring levels significantly impact prediction uncertainty, with longer censoring times leading to greater variability in survival probabilities. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating model multiplicity in predictive maintenance frameworks to achieve more reliable and robust failure predictions. This paper contributes to uncertainty quantification in RUL prediction and highlights the Rashomon perspective as a powerful tool for predictive modeling."}

Exploring Joint Training in the Context of Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning", "abstract": "Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to adapt to continuously emerging new classes while preserving knowledge of previously learned ones. Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a greater challenge that requires the model to learn new classes from only a limited number of samples per class. While incremental learning typically assumes restricted access to past data, it often remains available in many real-world scenarios. This raises a practical question: should one retrain the model on the full dataset (i.e., joint training), or continue updating it solely with new data? In CIL, joint training is considered an ideal benchmark that provides a reference for evaluating the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. However, in FSCIL, joint training becomes less reliable due to severe imbalance between base and incremental classes. This results in the absence of a practical baseline, making it unclear which strategy is preferable for practitioners. To this end, we revisit joint training in the context of FSCIL by incorporating imbalance mitigation techniques, and suggest a new imbalance-aware joint training benchmark for FSCIL. We then conduct extensive comparisons between this benchmark and FSCIL methods to analyze which approach is most suitable when prior data is accessible. Our analysis offers realistic insights and guidance for selecting training strategies in real-world FSCIL scenarios. Code is available at:this https URL"}

Traditional control methods rely on static heating curves that are based solely on outdoor temperature, neglecting system state measurements, such as indoor temperature, and free heat sources, such as solar gain. A more effective strategy is model predictive control (MPC), which optimizes heating control by incorporating system state predictions based on weather forecasts, among other factors. However, current industrial MPC solutions often employ simplified physics-inspired indoor temperature models, sacrificing accuracy for robustness and interpretability. To bridge this gap, we propose a partially stochastic deep learning (DL) architecture for building-specific indoor temperature modeling. Unlike most studies that evaluate model performance through simulations or limited test buildings, our experiments across a large dataset of 100 real-world buildings, covering various heating season conditions, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms a widely used industrial physics-based model in predictive accuracy. The proposed DL architecture shows significant potential to improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency in heating MPC solutions. Although its computational cost is higher than that of the reference model, we discuss why this trade-off is manageable, even in large-scale applications. Unlike deterministic black-box approaches, the partially stochastic DL model offers a critical advantage by enabling pre-assessment of model feasibility through predictive uncertainty quantification. This work advances heating MPC, particularly for buildings with comprehensive datasets on their thermal behavior under various weather conditions."}

Lew,Tim Vieira", "title": "Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling", "abstract": "The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models."}

Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework", "abstract": "WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task."}

In this paper, we address the critical need for generating syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads. We highlight the limitations of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to the test targets (SQL queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services, like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services.

Traditional HPs capture self-reinforcement via parametric impact functions that can be inspected to understand how each event modulates the intensity of others. Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility, resulting in improved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability, which is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and improve upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact functions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a neural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale event sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than traditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches, and allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding transformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings. Results show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in simulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset, and gains clinically meaningful interpretation on Duke-EHR with children diagnosis dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our flexible impact kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics in EHRs and other data effectively, implying that interpretability can be maintained without loss of performance."}

Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body tasks in under an hour of real-world interactions, without relying on any demonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors.

We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data.

Recent studies have revealed the sink token, which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper, the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput, while also achieving superior performance on LongBench."}

Inference emerges as a cycle of bidirectional interactions, bottom-up contextual disambiguation paired with top-down content reconstruction, which resolves the Information Bottleneck in Optimal Transport (iBOT). Implemented via Rao-Blackwellized variational entropy minimization, CCUP steers representations toward minimal joint uncertainty while preserving inferential directionality. Local cycle completion underpins temporal bootstrapping, chaining simulations to refine memory, and spatial bootstrapping, enabling compositional hierarchical inference. We prove a Delta Convergence Theorem showing that recursive entropy minimization yields delta-like attractors in latent space, stabilizing perceptual schemas and motor plans. Temporal bootstrapping through perception-action loops and sleep-wake consolidation further transforms episodic traces into semantic knowledge. Extending CCUP, each hierarchical level performs delta-seeded inference: low-entropy content seeds diffuse outward along goal-constrained paths shaped by top-down priors and external context, confining inference to task-relevant manifolds and circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Building on this, we propose that language emerges as a symbolic transport system, externalizing latent content to synchronize inference cycles across individuals.

This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz.

Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates.

We evaluate a classical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using Qiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum devices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the low-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware.

Results show that while the classical GAN achieved the best scores, the 7-qubit HQCGAN produced competitive performance, narrowing the gap in later epochs, whereas the 3-qubit model exhibited earlier convergence limitations.

This problem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft allow users to easily create custom LLM \"assistants\" specialized to particular types of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized and difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often benefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can then be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask. For example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first select an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary, and then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from the summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms, this setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of each LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus, unlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly affects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs, creating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted for during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm that trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online manner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks, even in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on telecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM selection algorithms."}

Through detailed comparisons of autonomy control, prompt engineering, explainability, and governance frameworks, this paper provides a roadmap for responsible AI integration in software engineering, aligning with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and Canada's AIDA to ensure safe, transparent, and accountable AI-driven development."}

However, most research focuses on improving the output quality of LLMs (e.g., correctness), and less attention has been paid to the LLM input (e.g., the training code quality). Given that code smells are widely existed in practice and can negatively impact software maintainability and readability, this study takes the first systematic research to assess and improve dataset quality in terms of code smells. In this work, we first conduct a preliminary study to explore the presence of code smells in a popular benchmark dataset (i.e., CodeSearchNet-Python}) and evaluate the output of several popular LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama, and MagiCoder), revealing that code smell issues extensively exist in LLM's input (e.g., benchmark dataset) and output (e.g., generated code). We then conduct our systematic research by taking three main steps: Firstly, we propose an LLM-based code smell cleaning tool, named SmellCC, which automatically refactors and removes code smells. To evaluate the correctness of the code refactoring, we construct a test set of 50 repositories sourced from the CodeSearchNet-Python benchmark for functional testing. Then we apply our curated smell-cleaned dataset to fine-tune two LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-V2 and Qwen-Coder) to explore their potential for generating high-quality code. Thirdly, we investigate the impact of code smells on two downstream tasks: code completion and code search. Lastly, we derive several actionable implications for software engineering researchers and industry practitioners from our findings."}

Several approaches have been proposed to support understanding such modifications by separating them into those two parts. Such refactoring-aware approaches are expected to be particularly effective when the behavior-preserving parts can be decomposed into a sequence of more primitive behavior-preserving operations, such as refactorings, but this has not been explored. In this paper, as an initial validation, we quantify how much of the behavior-preserving modifications can be decomposed into refactoring operations using a dataset of functionally-equivalent method pairs. As a result, when using an existing refactoring detector, only 33.9% of the changes could be identified as refactoring operations. In contrast, when including 67 newly defined functionally-equivalent operations, the coverage increased by over 128%. Further investigation into the remaining unexplained differences was conducted, suggesting improvement opportunities."}

However, it remains a challenging task. A study on GitHub shows that only 42.2% of the issues are correctly linked to their commits. This highlights the potential for further development and research in this area. Existing studies have employed various AI/ML-based approaches, and with the recent development of large language models, researchers have leveraged LLMs to tackle this problem. These approaches suffer from two main issues. First, LLMs are constrained by limited context windows and cannot ingest all of the available data sources, such as long commit histories, extensive issue comments, and large code repositories. Second, most methods operate on individual issue-commit pairs; that is, given a single issue-commit pair, they determine whether the commit resolves the issue. This quickly becomes impractical in real-world repositories containing tens of thousands of commits. To address these limitations, we present LinkAnchor, the first autonomous LLM-based agent designed for issue-to-commit link recovery. The lazy-access architecture of LinkAnchor enables the underlying LLM to access the rich context of software, spanning commits, issue comments, and code files, without exceeding the token limit by dynamically retrieving only the most relevant contextual data. Additionally, LinkAnchor is able to automatically pinpoint the target commit rather than exhaustively scoring every possible candidate. Our evaluations show that LinkAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art issue-to-commit link recovery approaches by 60-262% in Hit@1 score across all our case study projects. We also publicly release LinkAnchor as a ready-to-use tool, along with our replication package. LinkAnchor is designed and tested for GitHub and Jira, and is easily extendable to other platforms."}

We then manually analyze the user reviews sampled from 32 AI coding assistants that have sufficient installations and reviews to construct a comprehensive taxonomy of user concerns and feedback about these assistants. We manually annotate each review's attitude when mentioning certain aspects of coding assistants, yielding nuanced insights into user satisfaction and dissatisfaction regarding specific features, concerns, and overall tool performance.

These DApps are blockchain based online lottery platforms. They utilize smart contracts to manage the entire lottery process, including issuance, betting, drawing, and prize distribution. Being decentralized, lottery DApps operate without central oversight, unlike traditional lotteries. This ensures fairness and eliminates control by any single entity. Automated smart contract execution further reduces management costs, increases profitability, and enhances game transparency and credibility. Next, we analyze an existing Ethereum based gambling DApp, detailing its technical principles, implementation, operational status, vulnerabilities, and potential solutions. We then elaborate on the implementation of lottery DApps. Smart contracts automate the entire lottery process including betting, drawing, and prize distribution. Although developing lottery DApps requires technical expertise, the expanding Ethereum ecosystem provides growing tools and frameworks, lowering development barriers. Finally, we discuss current limitations and prospects of lottery DApps. As blockchain technology and smart contracts evolve, lottery DApps are positioned to significantly transform the online lottery industry. Advantages like decentralization, automation, and transparency will likely drive broader future adoption."}

Software engineers often rely on LLMs to assess whether system code implementation satisfy task requirements, thereby enhancing code robustness and accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can reliably determine whether the code complies fully with the given task descriptions, which is usually natural language specifications. In this paper, we uncover a systematic failure of LLMs in evaluating whether code aligns with natural language requirements. Specifically, with widely used benchmarks, we employ unified prompts to judge code correctness. Our results reveal that LLMs frequently misclassify correct code implementations as either ``not satisfying requirements'' or containing potential defects. Surprisingly, more complex prompting, especially when leveraging prompt engineering techniques involving explanations and proposed corrections, leads to higher misjudgment rate, which highlights the critical reliability issues in using LLMs as code review assistants. We further analyze the root causes of these misjudgments, and propose two improved prompting strategies for mitigation. For the first time, our findings reveals unrecognized limitations in LLMs to match code with requirements. We also offer novel insights and practical guidance for effective use of LLMs in automated code review and task-oriented agent scenarios."}

Bugs in widely used deep learning APIs can propagate to downstream systems, causing serious consequences. While existing fuzzing techniques detect bugs through intra-framework testing across hardware backends (CPU vs. GPU), they may miss bugs that manifest identically across backends and thus escape detection under these strategies. To address this problem, we propose XAMT, a cross-framework fuzzing method that tests deep learning libraries by matching and comparing functionally equivalent APIs across different frameworks. XAMT matches APIs using similarity-based rules based on names, descriptions, and parameter structures. It then aligns inputs and applies variance-guided differential testing to detect bugs. We evaluated XAMT on five popular frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer, and JAX. XAMT matched 839 APIs and identified 238 matched API groups, and detected 17 bugs, 12 of which have been confirmed. Our results show that XAMT uncovers bugs undetectable by intra-framework testing, especially those that manifest consistently across backends. XAMT offers a complementary approach to existing methods and offers a new perspective on the testing of deep learning libraries."}

To address this limitation, this paper proposes RUM, a comprehensive assessment approach that combines rules and large language models (LLMs). RUM achieves a comprehensive assessment by rapidly processing objective indicators through rules while utilizing LLMs for in-depth subjective analysis of test case documents, test scripts, and test reports. The experimental results show that compared to traditional manual testing skill assessment, RUM improves assessment efficiency by 80.77\\% and reduces costs by 97.38\\%, while maintaining high accuracy and consistency of assessment. By applying RUM on the contest on software testing, we find that it not only enhances the efficiency and scalability of skill assessment in software testing education, but also provides teachers with more comprehensive and objective evidence for student ability assessment, facilitating personalized teaching and learning. This study offers new insights into the assessment of testing skills, which are expected to promote further development in test process optimization and software quality assurance."}

Realizing such models requires substantial system-level support. Deep learning (DL) frameworks provide this foundation by enabling efficient model construction, distributed execution, and optimized deployment. The large parameter scale and extended execution cycles impose exacting demands on deep learning frameworks, particularly in terms of scalability, stability, and efficiency. Therefore, poor usability, limited functionality, and subtle bugs in DL frameworks may hinder development efficiency and cause severe failures or resource waste. However, a fundamental question has not been thoroughly investigated in previous studies, i.e., what challenges do DL frameworks face in supporting LLMs? To answer this question, we analyze issue reports from three major DL frameworks (i.e., MindSpore, PyTorch, and TensorFlow) and eight associated LLM toolkits such as Megatron. Based on a manual review of these reports, we construct a taxonomy that captures LLM-centric framework bugs, user requirements, and user questions. We then refine and enrich this taxonomy through interviews with 11 LLM users and eight DL framework developers. Based on the constructed taxonomy and findings summarized from interviews, our study further reveals key technical challenges and mismatches between LLM user needs and developer priorities."}

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards -- SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified -- have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (79 entries) and Verified (99 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 80 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies."}

In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems."}

Large language models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context, software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of 114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 28.07%, highlighting challenges in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development. NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area."}

Yet, despite recent advances, their outputs often suffer from syntactic and semantic errors and remain difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals their problems, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.In this paper, we present D-LIFT, an enhanced decompiler-LLM pipeline with a fine-tuned LLM using code quality-aware reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LIFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: preserving accuracy while improving readability. Central to D-LIFT, we propose D-Score, an integrated code quality assessment system to score the decompiled source code from multiple aspects, and use it to guide reinforcement learning fine-tuning and to select the best output during inference. In line with our principle, D-Score assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-Score-driven fine-tuning, our trained LLMs produce 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-Score. Overall, D-LIFT improves the quality of 68.2% of all the functions produced by the native decompiler."}

However, training effective machine learning models for this task is often constrained by the high cost and expertise required for data annotation. Active learning is a promising approach to mitigate this challenge by intelligently selecting the most informative data points for labeling. This paper proposes a novel method to significantly enhance the active learning process by using dataset maps. Our approach systematically identifies samples that are hard-to-learn for a model and integrates this information to create a more sophisticated sample selection strategy. Unlike traditional active learning methods that focus primarily on model uncertainty, our strategy enriches the selection process by considering learning difficulty, allowing the active learner to more effectively pinpoint truly informative examples. The experimental results show that our approach can improve F1 score over random selection by 61.54% (DeepGini) and 45.91% (K-Means) and outperforms standard active learning by 8.23% (DeepGini) and 32.65% (K-Means) for CodeBERT on the Big-Vul dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating dataset maps for optimizing sample selection in vulnerability detection. Furthermore, our approach also enhances model robustness, improves sample selection by filtering hard-to-learn data, and stabilizes active learning performance across iterations. By analyzing the characteristics of these outliers, we provide insights for future improvements in dataset construction, making vulnerability detection more reliable and cost-effective."}
