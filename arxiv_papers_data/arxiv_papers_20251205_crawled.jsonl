The paper makes three philosophical contributions. First, I articulate the ``specification trap'' argument demonstrating why content-based value specification appears structurally unstable due to the conjunction of the is-ought gap, value pluralism, and the extended frame problem. Second, I propose syntropy -- the recursive reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment -- as an information-theoretic framework for understanding multi-agent alignment dynamics. Third, I establish a functional distinction between genuine and simulated moral capacity grounded in compatibilist theories of guidance control, coupled with an embodied experimental paradigm and verification regime providing operational criteria independent of phenomenological claims. This paper represents the philosophical component of a broader research program whose empirical validation is being developed in a separate project currently in preparation. While the framework generates specific, falsifiable predictions about value emergence and moral agency in artificial systems, empirical validation remains pending."}

However, this paradigm might incur substantial token overhead, especially when models \"overthink\" by producing lengthy reasoning chains, which can even lead to incorrect answers. A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks.

The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration)."}

In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems. Our findings reveal significant gaps between current agent capabilities and the robust generalization required for reliable cooperation, particularly in scenarios demanding persuasion and norm enforcement."}

Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality."}

This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains.

We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search.

RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics.

We tested our approach using different federated architectures for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-to-Computed Tomography (CT) conversion. The proposed adaptive strategy optimises the federated training by selectively freezing the encoder weights based on the monitored relative difference of the encoder weights from round to round.

When fine-tuned on clinical data from 635 patients in the multicenter FAME2 study, PINS-CAD predicts future cardiovascular events with an AUC of 0.73, outperforming clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines. This demonstrates that physics-informed pretraining boosts sample efficiency and yields physiologically meaningful representations. Furthermore, PINS-CAD generates spatially resolved pressure and fractional flow reserve curves, providing interpretable biomarkers. By embedding physical priors into geometric deep learning, PINS-CAD transforms routine angiography into a simulation-free, physiology-aware framework for scalable, preventive cardiology."}

In this work, we propose Delta Sampling (DS), a novel method that enables knowledge transfer across base models with different architectures, without requiring access to the original training data. DS operates entirely at inference time by leveraging the delta: the difference in model predictions before and after the adaptation of a base model. This delta is then used to guide the denoising process of a new base model. We evaluate DS across various SD versions, demonstrating that DS achieves consistent improvements in creating desired effects (e.g., visual styles, semantic concepts, and structures) under different sampling strategies.

However, such an exposure strategy can also reinforce users' existing preferences, leading to a notorious phenomenon named filter bubbles. Given its negative effects, such as group polarization, increasing attention has been paid to exploring reasonable measures to filter bubbles. However, most existing evaluation metrics simply measure the diversity of user exposure, failing to distinguish between algorithmic preference modeling and actual information confinement. In view of this, we introduce Bubble Escape Potential (BEP), a behavior-aware measure that quantifies how easily users can escape from filter bubbles. Specifically, BEP leverages a contrastive simulation framework that assigns different behavioral tendencies (e.g., positive vs. negative) to synthetic users and compares the induced exposure patterns. This design enables decoupling the effect of filter bubbles and preference modeling, allowing for more precise diagnosis of bubble severity. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple recommendation models to examine the relationship between predictive accuracy and bubble escape potential across different groups. To the best of our knowledge, our empirical results are the first to quantitatively validate the dilemma between preference modeling and filter bubbles. What's more, we observe a counter-intuitive phenomenon that mild random recommendations are ineffective in alleviating filter bubbles, which can offer a principled foundation for further work in this direction."}

We motivate PAS protocols by describing intuitive use-cases in which they mitigate risks from misaligned systems that subvert other control efforts, for instance, by disabling automated monitors or self-exfiltrating to external data centres. PAS protocols supplement other safety efforts, such as alignment fine-tuning or monitoring, contributing to defence-in-depth against AI risk. We provide a concrete demonstration in SHADE-Arena, a benchmark for AI monitoring and subversion capabilities, in which PAS protocols supplement monitoring to increase safety with little cost to performance. Next, PAS protocols should be robust to malicious actors who want to bypass shutdown. Therefore, we conduct a red-team blue-team game between the developers (blue-team), who must implement a robust PAS protocol, and a red-team trying to subvert the protocol. We conduct experiments in a code-generation setting, finding that there are effective strategies for the red-team, such as using another model to filter inputs, or fine-tuning the model to prevent shutdown behaviour. We then outline key challenges to implementing PAS protocols in real-life systems, including: security considerations of the password and decisions regarding when, and in which systems, to use them.

This paper addresses this question by extending a previously proposed disjoint community detection method, termed $\\alpha$-Hierarchical Clustering, to the influence maximization problem under the Independent Cascade model. The proposed method is compared with an alternative approach that employs the same seed selection criteria but relies on communities of lower quality obtained through standard Hierarchical Clustering. The former is referred to as Hierarchical Clustering-based Influence Maximization, while the latter, which leverages higher-quality community structures to guide seed selection, is termed $\\alpha$-Hierarchical Clustering-based Influence Maximization. Extensive experiments are performed on multiple real-world datasets to assess the effectiveness of both methods. The results demonstrate that higher-quality community structures substantially improve information diffusion under the Independent Cascade model, particularly when the propagation probability is low.

Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct.

Here, we introduce e-valuator, a method to convert any black-box verifier score into a decision rule with provable control of false alarm rates. We frame the problem of distinguishing successful trajectories (that is, a sequence of actions that will lead to a correct response to the user's prompt) and unsuccessful trajectories as a sequential hypothesis testing problem. E-valuator builds on tools from e-processes to develop a sequential hypothesis test that remains statistically valid at every step of an agent's trajectory, enabling online monitoring of agents over arbitrarily long sequences of actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that e-valuator provides greater statistical power and better false alarm rate control than other strategies across six datasets and three agents. We additionally show that e-valuator can be used for to quickly terminate problematic trajectories and save tokens. Together, e-valuator provides a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that converts verifier heuristics into decisions rules with statistical guarantees, enabling the deployment of more reliable agentic systems."}

BEAT-CF (Bayesian evidence-adaptive treatment of CF) was established to build an evidence-informed knowledge base for CF management.

The causal model describes relationships between background risk factors, treatments, and pathogen colonisation of the airways that affect the outcome of an individual PEx episode. The key factors, outcomes, and causal relationships were elicited from CF clinical experts and together represent current expert understanding of the pathophysiology of a PEx episode, guiding the design of data collection and studies and enabling causal inference.

First, the canonical Shapley framework assumes that the worth function is additive, yet real-world payoff constructions--driven by non-Gaussian distributions, heavy tails, feature dependence, or domain-specific loss scales--often violate this assumption, leading to distorted attributions. Secondly, achieving sparse explanations in high dimensions by computing dense Shapley values and then applying ad hoc thresholding is prohibitively costly and risks inconsistency. We introduce Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR), a unified nonlinear explanation framework. SISR simultaneously learns a monotonic transformation to restore additivity--obviating the need for a closed-form specification--and enforces an L0 sparsity constraint on the Shapley vector, enhancing computational efficiency in large feature spaces. Its optimization algorithm leverages Pool-Adjacent-Violators for efficient isotonic regression and normalized hard-thresholding for support selection, yielding implementation ease and global convergence guarantees. Analysis shows that SISR recovers the true transformation in a wide range of scenarios and achieves strong support recovery even in high noise. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate that irrelevant features and inter-feature dependencies can induce a true payoff transformation that deviates substantially from linearity. Experiments in regression, logistic regression, and tree ensembles demonstrate that SISR stabilizes attributions across payoff schemes, correctly filters irrelevant features while standard Shapley values suffer severe rank and sign distortions. By unifying nonlinear transformation estimation with sparsity pursuit, SISR advances the frontier of nonlinear explainability, providing a theoretically grounded and practical attribution framework."}

In the meantime, they do not give the user any hints as to whether their reasoning is on the right track, and do not give the user any recourse to stop and correct them if their reasoning is flawed. This creates a frustrating, but unfortunately common, experience: the user's time is wasted while the model reasons from a false premise that could have easily been corrected. In contrast, human speakers typically perform lightweight, incremental grounding acts to ensure that participants in the conversation are on the same page; here we ask if language models can learn to leverage a similar type of behavior? With this motivation, we propose interleaved reasoning (IR), in which the model alternates between thinking and surfacing intermediate responses, as an alternative to the standard \"think-then-answer\" approach. By providing useful information to the user earlier, IR reduces perceived latency, the time a user waits for an initial output, without compromising the quality of the final response. We further introduce a specialization of interleaved reasoning, Plantain (Plan-Thought-Answer Interleaving), where the first intermediate response is an explicit, step-by-step plan for executing the task. This plan-first strategy allows for user intervention and early feedback for subsequent reasoning steps. We demonstrate that Plantain yields an ~6% improvement in pass@1 across several challenging math reasoning and coding benchmarks, while reducing time-to-first-response by over 60% relative to think-then-answer baselines."}

Integrating dMRI with the compartment-based biophysical VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) framework offers richer microstructural insights, though clinical gradient systems (40-80 mT/m) suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at stronger diffusion weightings due to prolonged echo times. Ultra-strong gradients (up to 300 mT/m) can mitigate these limitations by improving SNR and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) but their adoption has until recently been limited to research environments due to challenges with peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds and gradient non-uniformity. This study investigates whether physics-informed self-supervised VERDICT (ssVERDICT) fitting applied to ultra-strong gradients enhances prostate cancer characterization relative to current clinical acquisitions. We developed enhanced ssVERDICT fitting approaches using dense multilayer perceptron (Dense MLP) and convolutional U-Net architectures, benchmarking them against non-linear least-squares (NLLS) fitting and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging across clinical- to ultra-strong gradient systems. Dense ssVERDICT at ultra-strong gradient notably outperformed NLLS VERDICT, boosting median CNR by 47%, cutting inter-patient Coefficient of Variation by 52%, and reducing pooled f_ic variation by 50%. Overall, it delivered the highest CNR, the most stable parameter estimates, and the clearest tumour-normal contrast compared with conventional methods and clinical gradient systems.

To address these limitations, we propose InvertiTune, a framework that combines a controlled data generation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Within this framework, the data-generation pipeline systematically extracts subgraphs from large knowledge bases, applies noise filtering, and leverages LLMs to generate corresponding natural text descriptions, a task more aligned with LLM capabilities than direct KG generation from text. This pipeline enables generating datasets composed of longer texts paired with larger KGs that better reflect real-world scenarios compared to existing benchmarks, thus supporting effective SFT of lightweight models for single-shot KG construction. Experimental results on CE12k, a dataset generated using the introduced pipeline, show that InvertiTune outperforms larger non-fine-tuned LLMs as well as state-of-the-art Text2KG approaches, while also demonstrating stronger cross-dataset generalization on CrossEval-1200, a test set created from three established benchmark datasets and CE12k.

Additionally, publicly available data often is not representative of users of a particular system -- for example, a research speech dataset of contractors interacting with an AI assistant will likely be more homogeneous, well articulated and self-censored than real world commands that end users will issue. Therefore unlocking high-quality data grounded in real user interactions is of vital interest. However, the direct use of user data comes with significant privacy risks. Differential Privacy (DP) is a well established framework for reasoning about and limiting information leakage, and is a gold standard for protecting user privacy. The focus of this work, \\emph{Differentially Private Synthetic data}, refers to synthetic data that preserves the overall trends of source data,, while providing strong privacy guarantees to individuals that contributed to the source dataset.

Our insight is that parameterizing the generator distribution enables an adversarial robustness perspective: during training, we can adapt the generator to emphasize datasets that are particularly challenging for the model. We formalize this by introducing an optimality gap measure, given by the difference between TFM performance and the best achievable performance as estimated by strong baselines such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests.

In online hybrid E3SM runs, M\\&M delivers the most consistent bias reductions across variables and vertical levels. The ML-augmented configurations remain stable and computationally feasible in multi-year simulations, providing a practical pathway for scalable hybrid modeling.

Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

Existing strategies for memory-bounded inference, such as quantization, offloading, or heuristic KV eviction, either incur high orchestration costs or rely on unreliable attention-based proxies of importance. We propose TRIM-KV, a novel approach that learns each token's intrinsic importance at creation time via a lightweight retention gate. Each gate predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, reflecting the long-term utility of the token for a specific layer and head. Tokens with low scores are evicted when the memory budget is exceeded, ensuring that the cache always contains the most critical tokens. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently through distillation from a frozen LLM combined with a capacity loss, requiring only gate fine-tuning and adding negligible inference overhead. Across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME24), procedural generation (LongProc), conversational long-memory benchmarks (LongMemEval), and long-context understanding (LongBench and SCBench), TRIM-KV consistently outperforms strong eviction and learnable retrieval baselines, especially in low-memory regimes. Remarkably, it even surpasses full-cache models in some settings, showing that selective retention can serve as a form of regularization, suppressing noise from uninformative tokens. Qualitative analyses further reveal that learned retention scores align with human intuition, naturally recovering heuristics such as sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit design. Beyond efficiency, retention scores provide insights into layer- and head-specific roles, suggesting a new path toward LLM interpretability."}

Progress has been hindered by a circular dependency: evaluating hallucinations requires labeled data, yet such labels are costly and subjective. We introduce HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes realistic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity, producing perceptually realistic but semantically incorrect outputs (segmentation IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36).

To address these limitations, we introduce BookRAG, a novel RAG approach targeted for documents with a hierarchical structure, which exploits logical hierarchies and traces entity relations to query the highly relevant information. Specifically, we build a novel index structure, called BookIndex, by extracting a hierarchical tree from the document, which serves as the role of its table of contents, using a graph to capture the intricate relationships between entities, and mapping entities to tree nodes. Leveraging the BookIndex, we then propose an agent-based query method inspired by the Information Foraging Theory, which dynamically classifies queries and employs a tailored retrieval workflow.

Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model.

However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information. Various Experiments demonstrate our NAS-LoRA improves existing PEFT methods, while reducing training cost by 24.14% without increasing inference cost, highlighting the potential of NAS in enhancing PEFT for visual foundation models."}

To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0. These results highlight that jointly scaling prompts and visuals is key to fully leveraging scaling laws at inference-time. Visualizations are available at the website:this https URL."}

To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length.

It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data.To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process."}

Recent in-flash computing (IFC) solutions alleviate this bottleneck by co-locating weight-related linear computations in the decode phase with flash, yet still rely on DRAM for the key-value (KV) cache. As context length grows, the KV cache can exceed model weights in size, imposing prohibitive DRAM cost and capacity requirements. Attempts to offload KV cache to flash suffer from severe performance penalties.We propose KVNAND, the first DRAM-free, IFC-based architecture that stores both model weights and KV cache entirely in compute-enabled 3D NAND flash. KVNAND addresses the fundamental performance challenges of flash under intensive KV cache access by leveraging IFC for all memory-bound operations to reduce data transfer overhead, introducing head-group parallelism to boost throughput, and employing page-level KV cache mapping to align token access patterns with flash organization. In addition, we propose a design space exploration framework that evaluates discrete and compact KVNAND variants to balance weight and KV placement, automatically identifying the optimal design trade-off.

Additionally, the extensive spatial redundancy and intricate background details typical in remote-sensing images tend to obscure these small targets. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Kernel Selection Network (MKSNet), a novel network architecture featuring a novel Multi-Kernel Selection mechanism. The MKS mechanism utilizes large convolutional kernels to effectively capture an extensive range of contextual information. This innovative design allows for adaptive kernel size selection, significantly enhancing the network's ability to dynamically process and emphasize crucial spatial details for small object detection. Furthermore, MKSNet also incorporates a dual attention mechanism, merging spatial and channel attention modules. The spatial attention module adaptively fine-tunes the spatial weights of feature maps, focusing more intensively on relevant regions while mitigating background noise. Simultaneously, the channel attention module optimizes channel information selection, improving feature representation and detection accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the DOTA-v1.0 and HRSC2016 benchmark demonstrate that MKSNet substantially surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in detecting small objects in remote sensing images.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAHL significantly enhances LLM robustness against both conventional attacks and the proposed TCA, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities in zero-shot evaluations while still preserving model performance on generic tasks.

Existing perturbation methods are frequently white-box and architecture specific. More importantly, while they are often successful, it is rarely clear why they work. Insights into the mechanism of this success would allow developers to understand and analyze these attacks, as well as fine-tune the model to prevent them. This paper presents BlackCAtt, a black-box algorithm and a tool, which uses minimal, causally sufficient pixel sets to construct explainable, imperceptible, reproducible, architecture-agnostic attacks on object detectors. BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with bounding boxes produced by object detectors to create adversarial attacks that lead to the loss, modification or addition of a bounding box. BlackCAtt works across different object detectors of different sizes and architectures, treating the detector as a black box. We compare the performance of BlackCAtt with other black-box attack methods and show that identification of causal pixels leads to more precisely targeted and less perceptible attacks. On the COCO test dataset, our approach is 2.7 times better than the baseline in removing a detection, 3.86 times better in changing a detection, and 5.75 times better in triggering new, spurious, detections. The attacks generated by BlackCAtt are very close to the original image, and hence imperceptible, demonstrating the power of causal pixels."}

This model uses the ResNet34 residual network as the backbone network and incorporates multi-scale feature extraction. It uses a multi-scale input module as the first layer of the ResNet34 network and an Inception v2 module as the residual downsampling layer. Furthermore, a channel attention mechanism module assigns different weights to different channels of the image from a channel domain perspective, obtaining more important feature information. The results after a five-fold crossover experiment show that the average classification accuracy of the improved network model is approximately 98.8%, which is not only 1% higher than ResNet34, but also only 80% of the number of parameters of the original model.

We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism.

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods."}

To address this issue, we introduce MPCFormer, an explainable socially-aware autonomous driving approach with physics-informed and data-driven coupled social interaction dynamics. In this model, the dynamics are formulated into a discrete space-state representation, which embeds physics priors to enhance modeling explainability. The dynamics coefficients are learned from naturalistic driving data via a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture. To the best of our knowledge, MPCFormer is the first approach to explicitly model the dynamics of multi-vehicle social interactions. The learned social interaction dynamics enable the planner to generate manifold, human-like behaviors when interacting with surrounding traffic.

We introduce VINE, a hierarchical vision-language-action model that separates high-level reasoning (System 2) from low-level control (System 1) under a hierarchical reinforcement learning formalism, making failures usable as a structured learning signal rather than noisy supervision. System 2 performs feasibility-guided tree search over a 2D scene-graph abstraction: it proposes subgoal transitions, predicts success probabilities from both successes and failures, and prunes brittle branches before execution, effectively casting plan evaluation as feasibility scoring. The selected subgoal sequence is then passed to System 1, which executes low-level actions without modifying the agent's core skills. Trained entirely from offline teleoperation data, VINE integrates negative experience directly into the decision loop.

In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation.

We introduce TARA (Test by Adaptive Ranks), a novel framework combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing for quantum anomaly detection that provides distribution-free validity guarantees. TARA offers two complementary approaches. TARA k, based on Kolmogorov Smirnov calibration against local hidden variable (LHV) null distributions, achieving ROC AUC = 0.96 for quantum-classical discrimination. And TARA-m, employing betting martingales for streaming detection with anytime valid type I error control that enables real time monitoring of quantum channels. We establish theoretical guarantees proving that under (context conditional) exchangeability, conformal p-values remain uniformly distributed even for strongly contextual quantum data, confirming that quantum contextuality does not break conformal prediction validity a result with implications beyond quantum certification to any application of distribution-free methods to nonclassical data. Extensive validation on both IBM Torino (superconducting, CHSH = 2.725) and IonQ Forte Enterprise (trapped ion, CHSH = 2.716) quantum processors demonstrates cross-platform robustness, achieving 36% security margins above the classical CHSH bound of 2. Critically, our framework reveals a methodological concern affecting quantum certification more broadly: same-distribution calibration can inflate detection performance by up to 44 percentage points compared to proper cross-distribution calibration, suggesting that prior quantum certification studies using standard train test splits may have systematically overestimated adversarial robustness."}

This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs.

Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as the recently proposed GaussMark, typically rely on small modifications to model weights, which can yield signals detectable to those equipped with a secret key, but achieving detection power comparable to inference-time watermarks generally requires weight perturbations that noticeably reduce generation quality. We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets.

Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance."}

Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't exhibited by base models? Our work, SkillFactory, is a method for fine-tuning models to roughly learn these skills during a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Our approach does not rely on distillation from a stronger model, but instead uses samples from the model itself, rearranged to provide training data in the format of those skills. These \"silver\" SFT traces may be imperfect, but are nevertheless effective for priming a model to acquire skills during RL. Our evaluation shows that (1) starting from SkillFactory SFT initialization helps a model to generalize to harder variants of a task post-RL, despite lower performance pre-RL; (2) cognitive skills are indeed used by the model; (3) RLed SkillFactory models are more robust to regression on out-of-domain tasks than RLed base models.

Although combining these approaches shows promise, current methods require fine-tuned reward and revision models. This paper proposes Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a simple yet effective approach that overcomes these limitations by strategically combining parallel and sequential techniques and fully leveraging LLMs' self-improvement abilities. SETS exploits the inherent self-verification and self-correction capabilities of LLMs, unifying sampling, verification, and correction within a single framework.

In contrast, we learn from observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence. We further extend our framework to handle heterogeneous cost preferences via an interval-conditioned architecture.

The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs.

In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance.

In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks.

While reinforcement learning provides a principled mechanism for such agents to improve through interaction, its effectiveness critically depends on the availability of structured training tasks. In many realistic settings, however, no such tasks exist a challenge we term task scarcity, which has become a key bottleneck for scaling agentic RL. Existing approaches typically assume predefined task collections, an assumption that fails in novel environments where tool semantics and affordances are initially unknown. To address this limitation, we formalize the problem of Task Generation for Agentic RL, where an agent must learn within a given environment that lacks predefined tasks. We propose CuES, a Curiosity driven and Environment grounded Synthesis framework that autonomously generates diverse, executable, and meaningful tasks directly from the environment structure and affordances, without relying on handcrafted seeds or external corpora. CuES drives exploration through intrinsic curiosity, abstracts interaction patterns into reusable task schemas, and refines them through lightweight top down guidance and memory based quality control. Across three representative environments, AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop, CuES produces task distributions that match or surpass manually curated datasets in both diversity and executability, yielding substantial downstream policy improvements.

We argue that ensuring fairness requires not only satisfying a target criterion, but also explaining which variables constrain its realization. When corrections are used to mitigate advantage transparently, they must remain sensitive to the distribution of true labels. To illustrate this approach, we built FairDream, a fairness package whose mechanism is made transparent for lay users, increasing the model's weights of errors on disadvantaged groups. While a user may intend to achieve Demographic Parity by the correction method, experiments show that FairDream tends towards Equalized Odds, revealing a conservative bias inherent to the data environment. We clarify the relationship between these fairness criteria, analyze FairDream's reweighting process, and compare its trade-offs with closely related GridSearch models. Finally, we justify the normative preference for Equalized Odds via an epistemological interpretation of the results, using their proximity with Simpson's paradox. The paper thus unites normative, epistemological, and empirical explanations of fairness interventions, to ensure transparency for the users."}

We propose a Privacy-Enhancing Technology (PET) framework for wearable devices, integrating federated learning, lightweight cryptographic methods, and selectively deployed blockchain technology. The blockchain acts as a secure ledger triggered only upon data transfer requests, granting users real-time notifications and control. By dismantling data monopolies, this approach returns data sovereignty to individuals. Through real-world applications like secure medical data sharing, privacy-preserving fitness tracking, and continuous health monitoring, our framework reduces privacy risks by up to 70 percent while preserving data utility and performance.

To navigate safely, this understanding must be derived from sensor data in real-time and needs to be represented in vectorized form. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to combine a set of camera images from multiple views into one joint latent BEV grid. Traditionally, from this latent space, an intermediate raster map is predicted, providing dense spatial supervision but requiring post-processing into the desired vectorized form. More recent models directly derive infrastructure elements as polylines using vectorized map decoders, providing instance-level information. Our approach, Augmentation Map Network (AugMapNet), proposes latent BEV feature grid augmentation, a novel technique that significantly enhances the latent BEV representation. AugMapNet combines vector decoding and dense spatial supervision more effectively than existing architectures while remaining easy to integrate compared to other hybrid approaches. It additionally benefits from extra processing on its latent BEV features. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate significant improvements on vectorized map prediction of up to 13.3% over the StreamMapNet baseline on 60 m range and greater improvements on larger ranges. We confirm transferability by applying our method to another baseline, SQD-MapNet, and find similar improvements.

Label-specific features (LSFs), constructed by LIFT, have proven effective for learning tasks with label ambiguity by leveraging clustering-based prototypes for each label to re-characterize instances. However, directly introducing LIFT into LDL tasks can be suboptimal, as the prototypes it collects primarily reflect intra-cluster relationships while neglecting cross-cluster interactions. Additionally, constructing LSFs using multi-perspective information, rather than relying solely on Euclidean distance, provides a more robust and comprehensive representation of instances, mitigating noise and bias that may arise from a single distance perspective. To address these limitations, we introduce Structural Anchor Points (SAPs) to capture inter-cluster interactions. This leads to a novel LSFs construction strategy, LIFT-SAP, which enhances LIFT by integrating both distance and directional information of each instance relative to SAPs. Furthermore, we propose a novel LDL algorithm, Label Distribution Learning via Label-specifIc FeaTure with SAPs (LDL-LIFT-SAP), which unifies multiple label description degrees predicted from different LSF spaces into a cohesive label distribution.

To address these limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories, supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling.

In particular, multi-turn RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates decision-making in multi-turn interactions.

However, their impressive generative power comes with a growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise watermarking framework. Our method embeds a watermark directly at the bit level of the token stream during the image generation process. Our bitwise watermark subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore, it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable detection of generated outputs.

Despite the success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology ``un-pruning\" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms. Our code is released atthis https URL."}

While data-driven findings in AI offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data cleaning stage."}

To address these issues we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which prevents conflicting gradients on valuable tokens by skipping negative updates while amplifying positive ones and filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold, to prevent policy collapse. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, as validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH, AIME 2024, AIME 2025 and AMC 2023."}

We prospectively collected TCCD data comprising 738 annotated frames and 3,419 labeled artery instances to establish a high-quality dataset for model training and evaluation. The proposed AAW-YOLO demonstrated strong performance in segmenting both ipsilateral and contralateral CoW vessels, achieving an average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of 0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, and mAP of 0.953, with a per-frame inference speed of 14.199 ms.

Recently, researchers have explored using LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra, specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of 1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations, optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast math operations to yield substantial performance gains.

Recent studies have proposed leveraging sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but increase vulnerability to attacks.

We provide a simple derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations. Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes.

In this work, we present the first formal theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware decision-making, in which the behaviour of the agent is directed towards optimizing a measure of long-run performance beyond the mean.

Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.

However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabilities from only expert demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks. These results demonstrate that our method effectively elicits strong reasoning performance from expert demonstrations alone, enabling robust reasoning learning even when task-specific verifiers are unavailable."}

Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement. The framework thus provides a unified and mathematically grounded basis for operator valued granules in quantum information processing, granular reasoning, and intelligent systems."}

When fusing multiple diarization systems, DOVER-Lap remains the only established approach, operating at the segment level with hard decisions. We propose working with continuous probability outputs, which enables more sophisticated fusion and calibration techniques that can leverage model uncertainty and complementary strengths across different architectures. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for calibrating and fusing EEND models at the probability level. We investigate two output formulations (multilabel and powerset representations) and their impact on calibration and fusion effectiveness. Through extensive experiments on the CallHome two-speaker benchmark, we demonstrate that proper calibration provides substantial improvements even for individual models (up to 19% relative DER reduction), in some cases mitigating the absence of domain adaptation. We reveal that joint calibration in powerset space consistently outperforms independent per-speaker calibration, that fusion substantially improves over individual models, and that the Fuse-then-Calibrate ordering generally outperforms both calibrating before fusion and uncalibrated fusion while requiring calibration of only a single combined model. Our best configuration outperforms DOVER-Lap in terms of DER while providing reliable confidence estimates essential for downstream applications. This work proposes best practices for probability-level fusion of EEND systems and demonstrates the advantages of leveraging soft outputs over hard decisions."}

Existing token reduction approaches typically adopt token pruning or merging to reduce computation. However, they inherently lead to information loss as they discard or compress token representations. This problem is further exacerbated when the same fine-grained token processing is uniformly applied across all images regardless of visual complexity. We observe that not all inputs require fine-grained processing: simple images can be effectively handled at a coarse resolution, while only complex ones require refinement. Based on this insight, we propose MambaScope, an adaptive framework for efficient inference for Vision Mamba. MambaScope first performs coarse-grained inference by dividing the input image into large patches, significantly reducing token length and computation. When the model's prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at a finer resolution to recover essential visual details with minimal additional cost. This dynamic resolution assignment strategy allows MambaScope to allocate computation adaptively according to image complexity, achieving efficient processing without compromising accuracy. Experiments across various vision tasks demonstrate that MambaScope outperforms both the baseline Vision Mamba and state-of-the-art token reduction techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency."}

Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency.

We examined anthropomorphism of a social AI chatbot during collaborative storytelling and asked how children's attributions related to their behavior and prefrontal activation. Children at ages 5-6 (N = 23) completed three storytelling sessions: interacting with (1) an AI chatbot only, (2) a parent only, and (3) the AI and a parent together. After the sessions, children completed an interview assessing anthropomorphism toward both the AI chatbot and the parent. Behavioral engagement was indexed by the conversational turn count (CTC) ratio, and concurrent fNIRS measured oxygenated hemoglobin in bilateral vmPFC and dmPFC regions. Children reported higher anthropomorphism for parents than for the AI chatbot overall, although AI ratings were relatively high for perceptive abilities and epistemic states. Anthropomorphism was not associated with CTC. In the right dmPFC, higher perceptive scores were associated with greater activation during the AI-only condition and with lower activation during the AI+Parent condition. Exploratory analyses indicated that higher dmPFC activation during the AI-only condition correlated with higher end-of-session \"scared\" mood ratings. Findings suggest that stronger perceptive anthropomorphism can be associated with greater brain activation related to interpreting the AI's mental states, whereas parent co-presence may help some children interpret and regulate novel AI interactions.

To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments.

In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task.

Based on these LLMs, businesses have started to provide Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS), offering feature extraction capabilities (in the form of text embeddings) that benefit downstream natural language processing tasks. However, prior research has demonstrated that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks, where an attacker clones the service's model in a black-box manner without access to the model's internal workings. In response, watermarks have been added to the text embeddings to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers by allowing them to check for model ownership. This thesis focuses on defending against imitation attacks by investigating EaaS watermarks. To achieve this goal, we unveil novel attacks and propose and validate new watermarking techniques.Firstly, we show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed through paraphrasing the input text when attackers clone the model during imitation attacks. Our study illustrates that paraphrasing can effectively bypass current state-of-the-art EaaS watermarks across various attack setups (including different paraphrasing techniques and models) and datasets in most instances. This demonstrates a new vulnerability in recent EaaS watermarking techniques.Subsequently, as a countermeasure, we propose a novel watermarking technique, WET (Watermarking EaaS with Linear Transformation), which employs linear transformation of the embeddings. Watermark verification is conducted by applying a reverse transformation and comparing the similarity between recovered and original embeddings. We demonstrate its robustness against paraphrasing attacks with near-perfect verifiability.

In this work, we introduce the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture that separates semantic planning from syntactic generation. We introduce an auxiliary ``Idea Head'' trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution for a future context window, creating a latent ``Concept Vector'' that actively gates the main vocabulary during generation. We propose a differentiable gating mechanism that suppresses semantically irrelevant tokens, effectively pruning the search space in real-time. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that while the Idea-Gated model achieves comparable validation perplexity to a standard GPT-2 baseline, it exhibits significantly superior Domain Retention. Qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals that the gating mechanism successfully locks generation into specific semantic clusters (e.g., Finance, Science) and resists associative drift, offering a parameter-efficient path toward more controllable language modeling."}

Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), most current approaches still rely on forward reasoning paradigms, generating step-by-step rationales from premises to conclusions. However, such methods often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift, resulting in inefficient and unreliable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR). The core idea is to integrate confidence-aware symbolic translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning. In the translation phase, only high-confidence spans are converted into logical form, such as First-Order Logic (FOL), while uncertain content remains in natural language. A translation reflection module further ensures semantic fidelity by evaluating symbolic outputs and reverting lossy ones back to text when necessary. In the reasoning phase, HBLR simulates human deductive thinking by assuming the conclusion is true and recursively verifying its premises. A reasoning reflection module further identifies and corrects flawed inference steps, enhancing logical coherence. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HBLR consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency."}

We show that this can be simply achieved by adding a ReLU function to the magnitude group and a sign function to the direction group.

In this work, we propose PretrainZero, a reinforcement active learning framework built on the pretraining corpus to extend RL from domain-specific post-training to general pretraining. PretrainZero features the following characteristics: 1) Active pretraining: inspired by the active learning ability of humans, PretrainZero learns a unified reasoning policy to actively identify reasonable and informative contents from pretraining corpus, and reason to predict these contents by RL. 2) Self-supervised learning: without any verifiable labels, pretrained reward models, or supervised fine-tuning, we directly pretrain reasoners from 3 to 30B base models on the general Wikipedia corpus using RL, significantly breaking the verification data-wall for general reasoning. 3) Verification scaling: by tackling increasingly challenging masked spans, PretrainZero substantially enhances the general reasoning abilities of pretrained base models.

First, we validate the effectiveness of exact Top-$k$ Decoding through extensive experimentation. Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2.

Specifically, we observe a trade-off between summary quality and factual faithfulness: explicit reasoning strategies tend to improve fluency at the expense of factual grounding, while implicit reasoning in LRMs exhibits the inverse pattern. Furthermore, increasing an LRM's internal reasoning budget does not improve, and can even hurt, factual consistency, suggesting that effective summarization demands faithful compression rather than creative over-thinking."}

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their potential application in the Hydro-SE domain is being increasingly explored. However, the knowledge and application abilities of LLMs in Hydro-SE have not been sufficiently evaluated.

Hydro-SE Bench covers nine subfields and enables evaluation of LLMs in aspects of basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application ability, and reasoning and calculation ability. The evaluation results on Hydro-SE Bench show that the accuracy values vary among 0.74 to 0.80 for commercial LLMs, and among 0.41 to 0.68 for small-parameter LLMs. While LLMs perform well in subfields closely related to natural and physical sciences, they struggle with domain-specific knowledge such as industry standards and hydraulic structures. Model scaling mainly improves reasoning and calculation abilities, but there is still great potential for LLMs to better handle problems in practical engineering application.

These units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support the models' syntactic performance. Critically, different types of syntactic agreement (e.g., subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units, suggesting that agreement constitutes a meaningful functional category for LLMs. This pattern holds in English, Russian, and Chinese; and further, in a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, structurally more similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement.

However, LLM output - here, the category assigned to a text - depends heavily on the wording of the prompt. While literature on prompt engineering is expanding, few studies focus on classification tasks, and even fewer address domains like psychology, where constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions that may not be well represented in pre-training data. We present an empirical framework for optimizing LLM performance for identifying constructs in texts via prompt engineering. We experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies --codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting - with zero-shot and few-shot classification. We find that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations do not fully address performance loss accompanying a badly worded prompt. Instead, the most influential features of a prompt are the construct definition, task framing, and, to a lesser extent, the examples provided. Across three constructs and two models, the classifications most aligned with expert judgments resulted from a few-shot prompt combining codebook-guided empirical prompt selection with automatic prompt engineering. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers generate and evaluate as many prompt variants as feasible, whether human-crafted, automatically generated, or ideally both, and select prompts and examples based on empirical performance in a training dataset, validating the final approach in a holdout set. This procedure offers a practical, systematic, and theory-driven method for optimizing LLM prompts in settings where alignment with expert judgment is critical."}

The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup."}

Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative."}

The common approach to extension trains a new tokenizer on domain-specific text and appends the tokens that do not overlap with the existing vocabulary, which often results in many tokens that are unreachable or never used. We propose continued BPE training, which adapts a pre-trained tokenizer by continuing the BPE merge learning process on new data. Experiments across multiple languages and model families show that this approach improves tokenization efficiency and leads to better utilization of added vocabulary. We also introduce leaf-based vocabulary pruning, which removes redundant tokens while preserving model quality.

To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality.This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7-33.1x and 3.3-13.2x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively."}

Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't exhibited by base models? Our work, SkillFactory, is a method for fine-tuning models to roughly learn these skills during a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Our approach does not rely on distillation from a stronger model, but instead uses samples from the model itself, rearranged to provide training data in the format of those skills. These \"silver\" SFT traces may be imperfect, but are nevertheless effective for priming a model to acquire skills during RL. Our evaluation shows that (1) starting from SkillFactory SFT initialization helps a model to generalize to harder variants of a task post-RL, despite lower performance pre-RL; (2) cognitive skills are indeed used by the model; (3) RLed SkillFactory models are more robust to regression on out-of-domain tasks than RLed base models.

We prove that under mild conditions, the resulting entropy-capacity objective is strictly convex with a unique stable optimum.

The emergence of generative AI encyclopedias, such as Grokipedia, possibly presents another potential shift in epistemic evolution. This study investigates whether AI- and human-curated encyclopedias rely on the same foundations of authority. We conducted a multi-scale comparative analysis of the citation networks from 72 matched article pairs, which cite a total of almost 60,000 sources. Using an 8-category epistemic classification, we mapped the \"epistemic profiles\" of the articles on each platform. Our findings reveal several quantitative and qualitative differences in how knowledge is sourced and encyclopedia claims are epistemologically justified. Grokipedia replaces Wikipedia's heavy reliance on peer-reviewed \"Academic & Scholarly\" work with a notable increase in \"User-generated\" and \"Civic organization\" sources. Comparative network analyses further show that Grokipedia employs very different epistemological profiles when sourcing leisure topics (such as Sports and Entertainment) and more societal sensitive civic topics (such as Politics & Conflicts, Geographical Entities, and General Knowledge & Society). Finally, we find a \"scaling-law for AI-generated knowledge sourcing\" that shows a linear relationship between article length and citation density, which is distinct from collective human reference sourcing. We conclude that this first implementation of an LLM-based encyclopedia does not merely automate knowledge production but restructures it. Given the notable changes and the important role of encyclopedias, we suggest the continuation and deepening of algorithm audits, such as the one presented here, in order to understand the ongoing epistemological shifts."}

Results showed that LLM-generated ads achieved statistical parity with human-written ads (51.1% vs. 48.9%, p > 0.05), with no significant performance differences for matched personalities.Building on these insights, our second study (n=800) shifted focus from individual personalization to universal persuasion, testing LLM performance across four foundational psychological principles: authority, consensus, cognition, and scarcity. AI-generated ads significantly outperformed human-created content, achieving a 59.1% preference rate (vs. 40.9%, p < 0.001), with the strongest performance in authority (63.0%) and consensus (62.5%) appeals.

However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs."}

In this work, we first reveal a critical and previously overlooked weakness: even state-of-the-art MLLMs are surprisingly brittle, showing significant performance degradation on images with simple orientation changes or natural corruptions, underscoring the need for more robust tool-based reasoning. To address this, we propose CodeVision, a flexible and scalable code-as-tool framework where the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries. We train our model using a two-stage methodology, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a high-quality dataset curated for complex, multi-turn tool composition and error recovery, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel and dense process reward function to encourage strategic and efficient tool use. To facilitate this research, we construct new SFT and RL datasets and introduce a challenging new benchmark suite designed to rigorously evaluate robustness to orientation changes and multi-tool reasoning. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series show that our approach significantly improves model performance and fosters emergent capabilities such as flexible tool composition, efficient chained execution, and robust error recovery from runtime feedback.

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods."}

To isolate a minimal form of this transformation, we identify language model subnetworks that make bigram predictions, naive next token predictions based only on the current token. We find that bigram subnetworks can be found in fully trained language models up to 1B parameters, and these subnetworks are critical for model performance even when they consist of less than 0.2% of model parameters. Bigram subnetworks are concentrated in the first Transformer MLP layer, and they overlap significantly with subnetworks trained to optimally prune a given model. Mechanistically, the bigram subnetworks often recreate a pattern from the full models where the first layer induces a sharp change that aligns activations with next token predictions rather than current token representations. Our results demonstrate that bigram subnetworks comprise a minimal subset of parameters that are both necessary and sufficient for basic next token predictions in language models, and they help drive the transformation from current to next token activations in the residual stream. These subnetworks can lay a foundation for studying more complex language model circuits by building up from a minimal circuit."}

Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle, but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue, demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability."}

While effective at capturing relative preferences, these methods are widely observed to suppress the absolute likelihoods of example responses. As a result, aligned models can deviate from expected patterns, exhibiting rewar-hacking effect even without an explicit reward model. This fundamental limitation of contrastive alignment, which we term likelihood underdetermination, motivates us to revisit direct preference optimization (DPO) -- the seminal direct alignment method. Interestingly, we show that the DPO loss admits a principled decomposition. The reformulated loss not only extends naturally to a broader range of feedback types, but also unveils the root cause of likelihood underdetermination. Specifically, we identify that standard DPO implicitly oversimplifies a regularizer in the reformulated loss; restoring this full term effectively resolves the underdetermination. Building on these insights, we introduce PRoximalized PReference Optimization (PRO), a unified alignment method that accommodates diverse feedback types while eliminating likelihood underdetermination through an efficient approximation of the full regularizer.

We further connect this fragment to established classes in formal language theory, automata theory, and algebra, yielding a unified framework for understanding transformer expressivity under this idealization. Finally, we present empirical results that align closely with our theory: transformers trained on languages within their characterized expressive capacity generalize reliably across sequence lengths, while they consistently fail to generalize on languages beyond it."}

Our findings reveal that response strategy largely shapes user experience, while actual user motivation has negligible impact.

RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs, thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1), the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2), the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance. To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and privacy-robustness."}

We conduct a comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by 3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning."}

Meanwhile, efforts to interpret their internal mechanisms have emerged, offering insights to enhance multilingual performance. While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy. Overall, our work enhances both the interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs from the perspective of MHA."}

Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression. C3 uses a simpler, pure-text pipeline that ignores factors like layout, color, and information loss from a visual encoder. This also suggests a potential upper bound for compression ratios in future work on optical character compression, OCR, and related fields.

Although existing works achieve impressive accomplishments in simultaneously harnessing image and text information, they lack the considerations of possible low-quality and missing modalities. In real-world applications, these issues might frequently occur, leading to urgent needs for models capable of predicting sentiment robustly. Therefore, we propose a Distribution-based feature Recovery and Fusion (DRF) method for robust multimodal sentiment analysis of image-text pairs. Specifically, we maintain a feature queue for each modality to approximate their feature distributions, through which we can simultaneously handle low-quality and missing modalities in a unified framework. For low-quality modalities, we reduce their contributions to the fusion by quantitatively estimating modality qualities based on the distributions. For missing modalities, we build inter-modal mapping relationships supervised by samples and distributions, thereby recovering the missing modalities from available ones. In experiments, two disruption strategies that corrupt and discard some modalities in samples are adopted to mimic the low-quality and missing modalities in various real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments on three publicly available image-text datasets, we demonstrate the universal improvements of DRF compared to SOTA methods under both two strategies, validating its effectiveness in robust multimodal sentiment analysis."}

However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes. We also find that 4/6 can be easily incorporated into many different post-training quantization methods and generally improves downstream accuracy. We hope this inspires future work in training and deploying models with NVFP4. Our code is available atthis http URL."}

We leverage a two-round automated scoring validated by human experts and deploy a score propagation module to obtain more consistent scores across the student similarity graph. Experiments show that combining automated scoring, expert calibration, and graph-based propagation yields simulated student that more closely track authentication by human judgments. We then analyze which profiles and behaviors are simulated more faithfully, supporting subsequent studies on personalized learning and educational assessment."}

In contrast, we learn from observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence.

Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries.

Recently, researchers have explored using LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra, specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of 1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations, optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast math operations to yield substantial performance gains.

Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%.

Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL regularization or advantage estimation.

In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research."}

Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward-cost introspection, ZIP-RC enables adaptive, efficient reasoning."}

This requires fundamentally different learning paradigms from pixel-based visual models. Symbolic visual learners parse diagrams into geometric primitives-points, lines, and shapes-whereas pixel-based learners operate on textures and colors. We propose a novel self-supervised symbolic auto-encoder that encodes diagrams into structured primitives and their interrelationships within the latent space, and decodes them through our executable engine to reconstruct the input diagrams. Central to this architecture is Symbolic Hierarchical Process Reward Modeling, which applies hierarchical step-level parsing rewards to enforce point-on-line, line-on-shape, and shape-on-relation consistency. Since vanilla reinforcement learning exhibits poor exploration in the policy space during diagram reconstruction; we thus introduce stabilization mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. We fine-tune our symbolic encoder on downstream tasks, developing a neuro-symbolic system that integrates the reasoning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic models through reasoning-grounded visual rewards. Evaluations across reconstruction, perception, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: achieving a 98.2% reduction in MSE for geometric diagram reconstruction, surpassing GPT-4o by 0.6% with a 7B model on chart reconstruction, and improving by +13% on the MathGlance perception benchmark, and by +3% on MathVerse and GeoQA reasoning benchmarks."}

The node serves to reallocate probability mass toward uncertainty, while preserving desirable properties such as end-to-end training and differentiability. This mechanism provides a natural escape route for highly ambiguous, anomalous, or noisy samples, particularly relevant for instance-dependent and asymmetric label noise. In systematic experiments involving the addition of varying proportions of instance-dependent noise or asymmetric noise to CIFAR-10/100 labels, our drainage formulation achieves an accuracy increase of up to 9\\% over existing approaches in the high-noise regime. Our results on real-world datasets, such as mini-WebVision, mini-ImageNet and Clothing-1M, match or surpass existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative analysis reveals a denoising effect, where the drainage neuron consistently absorbs corrupt, mislabeled, or outlier data, leading to more stable decision boundaries.

While recent differentiable rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved impressive photorealistic reconstruction, they suffer from scalability limitations and require annotations to decouple actor motion. Existing self-supervised methods attempt to eliminate explicit annotations by leveraging motion cues and geometric priors, yet they remain constrained by per-scene optimization and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we introduce Flux4D, a simple and scalable framework for 4D reconstruction of large-scale dynamic scenes. Flux4D directly predicts 3D Gaussians and their motion dynamics to reconstruct sensor observations in a fully unsupervised manner. By adopting only photometric losses and enforcing an \"as static as possible\" regularization, Flux4D learns to decompose dynamic elements directly from raw data without requiring pre-trained supervised models or foundational priors simply by training across many scenes. Our approach enables efficient reconstruction of dynamic scenes within seconds, scales effectively to large datasets, and generalizes well to unseen environments, including rare and unknown objects.

Both stages operate in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific training. Because existing datasets lack reliable material annotations, we evaluate our method using an LLM-as-a-Judge implemented in DeepEval.

Noise synthesis is an alternative to large-scale data acquisition: given a clean image, we can synthesize a realistic noisy counterpart. In this work, we propose a general and practical noise synthesis method that requires only one single noisy image and one single dark frame per ISO setting. We represent signal-dependent noise with a Poisson distribution and introduce a Fourier-domain spectral sampling algorithm to accurately model signal-independent noise. The latter generates diverse noise realizations that maintain the spatial and statistical properties of real sensor noise.

However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities.

The subtle, non-adjacent nature of early disease signals is often lost due to suboptimal architectural inductive biases: 2D/3D CNNs impose strong locality, while ViTs diffuse unconstrained global attention. This conflict leaves the optimal inductive structure for robust, sparse volumetric pattern recognition unresolved. This study presents a controlled comparison of sixteen modern deep learning architectures spanning 2D/3D convolutional, hybrid, and volumetric transformer families for subclinical keratoconus (SKC) detection from 3D anterior segment OCT volumes. We demonstrate that hierarchical attention models offer a superior and more parameter-efficient inductive bias, surpassing the performance of both 2D and 3D CNNs and ViTs. Our results show 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity in the sparse anomaly (subclinical) regime. Mechanistic analyses reveal that this advantage stems from precise spatial scale alignment: hierarchical windowing produces effective receptive fields matched to the intermediate, multi-slice extent of subclinical abnormalities. This avoids excessive CNN locality and diffuse global attention. Attention-distance measurements confirm a key insight into architectural adaptation: the required spatial integration length shifts significantly based on the signal strength, with subclinical cases necessitating longer integration compared to both healthy and manifest disease states. Representational similarity and auxiliary age/sex prediction tasks further support the generalizability of these inductive principles. The findings provide design guidance for future volumetric anomaly detection systems, establishing hierarchical attention as a principled and effective approach for early pathological change analysis in 3D medical imaging."}

Computed tomography (CT) scans are widely used for lung cancer diagnosis as they can give detailed lung structures. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming and prone to human error. To surmount this challenge, the study proposes a deep learning-based automatic lung cancer classification system to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. The IQOTHNCCD lung cancer dataset is utilized, which is a public CT scan dataset consisting of cases categorized into Normal, Benign, and Malignant and used DenseNet169, which includes Squeezeand-Excitation blocks for attention-based feature extraction, Focal Loss for handling class imbalance, and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature fusion. In addition, an SVM model was developed using MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, improving its classification performance. For model interpretability enhancement, the study integrated Grad-CAM for the visualization of decision-making regions in CT scans and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for explanation of feature contributions within the SVM model. Intensive evaluation was performed, and it was found that both DenseNet169 and SVM models achieved 98% accuracy, suggesting their robustness for real-world medical practice.

Most existing work relies on manual ROIs and rarely reports quality control (QC). We present LM-CartSeg, a fully automatic pipeline for cartilage/bone segmentation, geometric lateral/medial (L/M) compartmentalisation and radiomics analysis. Methods: Two 3D nnU-Net models were trained on SKM-TEA (138 knees) and OAIZIB-CM (404 knees). At test time, zero-shot predictions were fused and refined by simple geometric rules: connected-component cleaning, construction of 10 mm subchondral bone bands in physical space, and a data-driven tibial L/M split based on PCA and k-means. Segmentation was evaluated on an OAIZIB-CM test set (103 knees) and on SKI-10 (100 knees). QC used volume and thickness signatures. From 10 ROIs we extracted 4 650 non-shape radiomic features to study inter-compartment similarity, dependence on ROI size, and OA vs. non-OA classification on OAIZIB-CM Results: Post-processing improved macro ASSD on OAIZIB-CM from 2.63 to 0.36 mm and HD95 from 25.2 to 3.35 mm, with DSC 0.91; zero-shot DSC on SKI-10 was 0.80. The geometric L/M rule produced stable compartments across datasets, whereas a direct L/M nnU-Net showed domain-dependent side swaps. Only 6 to 12 percent of features per ROI were strongly correlated with volume or thickness. Radiomics-based models models restricted to size-linked features. Conclusions: LM-CartSeg yields automatic, QCd ROIs and radiomic features that carry discriminative information beyond simple morphometry, providing a practical foundation for multi-centre knee OA radiomics studies."}

In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model.

However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information. Various Experiments demonstrate our NAS-LoRA improves existing PEFT methods, while reducing training cost by 24.14% without increasing inference cost, highlighting the potential of NAS in enhancing PEFT for visual foundation models."}

To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0.

However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, these models often lack 3D consistency, a fundamental requirement for understanding scene geometry and motion, thereby causing severe spatial misalignment and temporal flickering in complex 3D environments. In this paper, we present Motion4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating 2D priors from foundation models into a unified 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our method features a two-part iterative optimization framework: 1) Sequential optimization, which updates motion and semantic fields in consecutive stages to maintain local consistency, and 2) Global optimization, which jointly refines all attributes for long-term coherence. To enhance motion accuracy, we introduce a 3D confidence map that dynamically adjusts the motion priors, and an adaptive resampling process that inserts new Gaussians into under-represented regions based on per-pixel RGB and semantic errors. Furthermore, we enhance semantic coherence through an iterative refinement process that resolves semantic inconsistencies by alternately optimizing the semantic fields and updating prompts of SAM2. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our Motion4D significantly outperforms both 2D foundation models and existing 3D-based approaches across diverse scene understanding tasks, including point-based tracking, video object segmentation, and novel view synthesis.

Additionally, the extensive spatial redundancy and intricate background details typical in remote-sensing images tend to obscure these small targets. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Kernel Selection Network (MKSNet), a novel network architecture featuring a novel Multi-Kernel Selection mechanism.

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods."}

Recent works on this topic have proposed a variety of approaches for accurately measuring human breath rate, however they are either tested in near-ideal conditions, or produce results that are not sufficiently accurate. The present study proposes a more robust method to measure breath rate in humans with minimal hardware requirements using a combination of mathematical transforms with a relative deviation from the ground truth of less than 5%. The method was tested on videos taken from 14 volunteers with a total duration of over 2 hours 30 minutes. The obtained results were compared to reference data and the average mean absolute error was found to be at 0.57 respirations per minute, which is noticeably better than the results from previous works. The breath rate measurement method proposed in the present article is more resistant to distortions caused by subject movement and thus allows one to remotely measure the subject's breath rate without any significant limitations on the subject's behavior."}

Current Unet architectures iteratively downsample spatial resolution while increasing channel dimensions to preserve information content. Such a structure demands a large memory footprint, limiting training batch sizes and increasing inference latency. Channel pruning compresses Unet architecture without accuracy loss, but requires lengthy optimization and may not generalize across tasks and datasets. By investigating Unet pruning, we hypothesize that the final structure is the crucial factor, not the channel selection strategy of pruning. Based on our observations, we propose a lean Unet architecture (LUnet) with a compact, flat hierarchy where channels are not doubled as resolution is halved. We evaluate on a public MRI dataset allowing comparable reporting, as well as on two internal CT datasets. We show that a state-of-the-art pruning solution (STAMP) mainly prunes from the layers with the highest number of channels. Comparatively, simply eliminating a random channel at the pruning-identified layer or at the largest layer achieves similar or better performance. Our proposed LUnet with fixed architectures and over 30 times fewer parameters achieves performance comparable to both conventional Unet counterparts and data-adaptively pruned networks. The proposed lean Unet with constant channel count across layers requires far fewer parameters while achieving performance superior to standard Unet for the same total number of parameters. Skip connections allow Unet bottleneck channels to be largely reduced, unlike standard encoder-decoder architectures requiring increased bottleneck channels for information propagation."}

First, despite pioneering the use of diffusion models in DD and delivering impressive performance, the vast majority of approaches paradoxically require a diffusion model pre-trained on the full target dataset, undermining the very purpose of DD and incurring prohibitive training costs. Second, although some methods turn to general text-to-image models without relying on such target-specific training, they suffer from a significant distributional mismatch, as the web-scale priors encapsulated in these foundation models fail to faithfully capture the target-specific semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Core Distribution Alignment (CoDA), a framework that enables effective DD using only an off-the-shelf text-to-image model. Our key idea is to first identify the \"intrinsic core distribution\" of the target dataset using a robust density-based discovery mechanism. We then steer the generative process to align the generated samples with this core distribution. By doing so, CoDA effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose generative priors and target semantics, yielding highly representative distilled datasets. Extensive experiments suggest that, without relying on a generative model specifically trained on the target dataset, CoDA achieves performance on par with or even superior to previous methods with such reliance across all benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K and its subsets.

Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy.

In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation.

While traditional Structure-from-Motion pipelines handle such cases through geometric verification and outlier rejection, feed-forward 3D reconstruction models lack these explicit mechanisms, leading to degraded performance under in-the-wild conditions. In this paper, we discover that the existing feed-forward reconstruction model, e.g., VGGT, despite lacking explicit outlier-rejection mechanisms or noise-aware training, can inherently distinguish distractor images. Through an in-depth analysis under varying proportions of synthetic distractors, we identify a specific layer that naturally exhibits outlier-suppressing behavior. Further probing reveals that this layer encodes discriminative internal representations that enable an effective noise-filtering capability, which we simply leverage to perform outlier-view rejection in feed-forward 3D reconstruction without any additional fine-tuning or supervision. Extensive experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that this implicit filtering mechanism is consistent and generalizes well across diverse scenarios."}

Prior works applying group-theoretic priors or modeling transformations typically operate in the high-dimensional data space, where group actions apply uniformly across the entire input, making it difficult to disentangle the subspace that varies under transformations. While latent-space methods offer greater flexibility, they still require manual partitioning of latent variables into equivariant and invariant subspaces, limiting the ability to robustly learn and operate group actions within the representation space. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework that for the first time learns group actions on latent image manifolds, automatically discovering transformation-relevant structures without manual intervention. Our method uses learnable binary masks with straight-through estimation to dynamically partition latent representations into transformation-sensitive and invariant components. We formulate this within a unified optimization framework that jointly learns latent disentanglement and group transformation mappings. The framework can be seamlessly integrated with any standard encoder-decoder architecture. We validate our approach on five 2D/3D image datasets, demonstrating its ability to automatically learn disentangled latent factors for group actions in diverse data, while downstream classification tasks confirm the effectiveness of the learned representations.

Moreover, some recently proposed lightweight INRs have shown comparable performance to their baseline codecs with computational complexity lower than 10kMACs/pixel. In this work, we extend NVRC toward lightweight representations, and propose NVRC-Lite, which incorporates two key changes. Firstly, we integrated multi-scale feature grids into our lightweight neural representation, and the use of higher resolution grids significantly improves the performance of INRs at low complexity. Secondly, we address the issue that existing INRs typically leverage autoregressive models for entropy coding: these are effective but impractical due to their slow coding speed. In this work, we propose an octree-based context model for entropy coding high-dimensional feature grids, which accelerates the entropy coding module of the model. Our experimental results demonstrate that NVRC-Lite outperforms C3, one of the best lightweight INR-based video codecs, with up to 21.03% and 23.06% BD-rate savings when measured in PSNR and MS-SSIM, respectively, while achieving 8.4x encoding and 2.5x decoding speedup.

This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs.

In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work.

In this paper, we find that the two issues can be solved in a very simple way: just fixing the variance (which would otherwise be predicted by the VAE encoder) to a constant (e.g., 0.5). On the one hand, this method allows the encoder to output a broader distribution of tokens and the decoder to learn to reconstruct clean images from the augmented token distribution, avoiding additional noise or denoising design. On the other hand, fixed variance simplifies the VAE evidence lower bound, making it stable to train an NF with a VAE jointly.

We tested our approach using different federated architectures for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-to-Computed Tomography (CT) conversion. The proposed adaptive strategy optimises the federated training by selectively freezing the encoder weights based on the monitored relative difference of the encoder weights from round to round. A patience-based mechanism ensures that freezing only occurs when updates remain consistently minimal.

M3DR leverages synthetic multilingual document data and generalizes across different vision-language architectures and model sizes, enabling robust cross-lingual and cross-modal alignment. Using contrastive training, our models learn unified representations for text and document images that transfer effectively across languages. We validate this capability on 22 typologically diverse languages, demonstrating consistent performance and adaptability across linguistic and script variations. We further introduce a comprehensive benchmark that captures real-world multilingual scenarios, evaluating models under monolingual, multilingual, and mixed-language settings. M3DR generalizes across both single dense vector and ColBERT-style token-level multi-vector retrieval paradigms.

However, when performing global localization using semantic objects, high semantic ambiguity intensifies object misclassification and increases the likelihood of incorrect associations, which in turn can cause significant errors in the estimated pose. Thus, in this letter, we propose a multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework for object-level global localization. The key idea is to exploit multi-label graph representations, rather than single-label alternatives, to capture and leverage the inherent semantic context of object observations. Based on these representations, our approach enhances semantic correspondence across graphs by combining the likelihood of each node with the maximum likelihood of its neighbors via context-aware likelihood propagation. For rigorous validation, data association and pose estimation performance are evaluated under both closed-set and open-set detection configurations. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to large-vocabulary object categories in both real-world indoor scenes and synthetic environments."}

Traditional policy learning paradigms, including both Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), struggle to cultivate generalizability across diverse scenarios. While IL policies often overfit to specific expert trajectories, RL suffers from the inherent lack of a unified and general reward signal necessary for effective multi-scene generalization. We posit that the world model is uniquely capable of serving as a universal environment proxy to address this limitation. However, current world models primarily focus on their ability to predict observations and still rely on task-specific, handcrafted reward functions, thereby failing to provide a truly general training environment. Toward this problem, we propose RoboScape-R, a framework leveraging the world model to serve as a versatile, general-purpose proxy for the embodied environment within the RL paradigm. We introduce a novel world model-based general reward mechanism that generates ''endogenous'' rewards derived from the model's intrinsic understanding of real-world state transition dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape-R effectively addresses the limitations of traditional RL methods by providing an efficient and general training environment that substantially enhances the generalization capability of embodied policies. Our approach offers critical insights into utilizing the world model as an online training strategy and achieves an average 37.5% performance improvement over baselines under out-of-domain scenarios."}

In this paper, rather than focusing on representation architectures as in many existing works, we propose a novel INR-based video compression framework, Neural Video Representation Compression (NVRC), targeting compression of the representation. Based on the novel entropy coding and quantization models proposed, NVRC, for the first time, is able to optimize an INR-based video codec in a fully end-to-end manner. To further minimize the additional bitrate overhead introduced by the entropy models, we have also proposed a new model compression framework for coding all the network, quantization and entropy model parameters hierarchically.

DynamicCity mainly consists of two key models. 1) A VAE model for learning HexPlane as the compact 4D representation. Instead of using naive averaging operations, DynamicCity employs a novel Projection Module to effectively compress 4D features into six 2D feature maps for HexPlane construction, which significantly enhances HexPlane fitting quality (up to 12.56 mIoU gain). Furthermore, we utilize an Expansion & Squeeze Strategy to reconstruct 3D feature volumes in parallel, which improves both network training efficiency and reconstruction accuracy than naively querying each 3D point (up to 7.05 mIoU gain, 2.06x training speedup, and 70.84% memory reduction). 2) A DiT-based diffusion model for HexPlane generation. To make HexPlane feasible for DiT generation, a Padded Rollout Operation is proposed to reorganize all six feature planes of the HexPlane as a squared 2D feature map. In particular, various conditions could be introduced in the diffusion or sampling process, supporting versatile 4D generation applications, such as trajectory- and command-driven generation, inpainting, and layout-conditioned generation. Extensive experiments on the CarlaSC and Waymo datasets demonstrate that DynamicCity significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D occupancy generation methods across multiple metrics.

To achieve this, we equip existing 3D detectors with an Online Adapter (OA) module -- a prompt-driven query generator for real-time correction. At the core of OA module are visual prompts: image-based descriptions of objects of interest derived from auxiliary feedback such as mismatches with 2D detections, road descriptions, or user clicks. These visual prompts, collected from risky objects during inference, are maintained in a visual prompt buffer to enable continuous correction in future frames.

In medical imaging, where distribution shifts are common, interactive methods can use user inputs to guide models towards improved predictions. Moreover, once a model is deployed, user corrections can be used to adapt the network parameters to the new data distribution, mitigating distribution shift. Based on these insights, we aim to develop a practical, effective method for improving the adaptive capabilities of interactive segmentation models to new data distributions in medical imaging. Firstly, we found that strengthening the model's responsiveness to clicks is important for the initial training process. Moreover, we show that by treating the post-interaction user-refined model output as pseudo-ground-truth, we can design a lean, practical online adaptation method that enables a model to learn effectively across sequential test images. The framework includes two components: (i) a Post-Interaction adaptation process, updating the model after the user has completed interactive refinement of an image, and (ii) a Mid-Interaction adaptation process, updating incrementally after each click. Both processes include a Click-Centered Gaussian loss that strengthens the model's reaction to clicks and enhances focus on user-guided, clinically relevant regions.

We achieve this by augmenting a standard NeRF with an additional network that models local egocentric gaze probability density, conditioned on scene geometry and observer position. The output of a NeRG is a rendered view of the scene alongside a pixel-wise salience map representing the conditional probability that a given observer fixates on visible surfaces. Unlike prior methods, our system is lightweight and enables visualization of gaze fields at interactive framerates. Moreover, NeRGs allow the observer perspective to be decoupled from the rendering camera and correctly account for gaze occlusion due to intervening geometry.

AugMapNet combines vector decoding and dense spatial supervision more effectively than existing architectures while remaining easy to integrate compared to other hybrid approaches. It additionally benefits from extra processing on its latent BEV features. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate significant improvements on vectorized map prediction of up to 13.3% over the StreamMapNet baseline on 60 m range and greater improvements on larger ranges. We confirm transferability by applying our method to another baseline, SQD-MapNet, and find similar improvements. A detailed analysis of the latent BEV grid confirms a more structured latent space of AugMapNet and shows the value of our novel concept beyond pure performance improvement.

This excessive computational demand limits the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios, particularly in the absence of dedicated computing devices such as GPUs and TPUs. To address these challenges, we propose Pan-LUT, a novel learnable look-up table (LUT) framework for pan-sharpening that strikes a balance between performance and computational efficiency for large remote sensing images. Our method makes it possible to process 15K*15K remote sensing images on a 24GB GPU. To finely control the spectral transformation, we devise the PAN-guided look-up table (PGLUT) for channel-wise spectral mapping. To effectively capture fine-grained spatial details, we introduce the spatial details look-up table (SDLUT). Furthermore, to adaptively aggregate channel information for generating high-resolution multispectral images, we design an adaptive output look-up table (AOLUT). Our model contains fewer than 700K parameters and processes a 9K*9K image in under 1 ms using one RTX 2080 Ti GPU, demonstrating significantly faster performance compared to other methods. Experiments reveal that Pan-LUT efficiently processes large remote sensing images in a lightweight manner, bridging the gap to real-world applications. Furthermore, our model surpasses SOTA methods in full-resolution scenes under real-world conditions, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency."}

To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation pipeline and construct FragFake, a large-scale benchmark of AI-edited images spanning multiple source datasets, diverse editing models, and several common edit types. Building on FragFake, we are the first to systematically study vision language models (VLMs) for edited-image classification and edited-region localization. Our experiments show that pretrained VLMs, including GPT4o, perform poorly on this task, whereas fine-tuned models such as Qwen2.5-VL achieve high accuracy and substantially higher object precision across all settings.

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{VIPGuard}, a unified multimodal framework designed to capture fine-grained and comprehensive facial representations of a given identity, compare them against potentially fake or similar-looking faces, and reason over these comparisons to make accurate and explainable predictions. Specifically, our framework consists of three main stages. First, fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to learn detailed and structural facial attributes.

Finally, we introduce user-specific customization, where we model the unique characteristics of the target face identity and perform semantic reasoning via MLLM to enable personalized and explainable deepfake detection. Our framework shows clear advantages over previous detection works, where traditional detectors mainly rely on low-level visual cues and provide no human-understandable explanations, while other MLLM-based models often lack a detailed understanding of specific face identities.

Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories.

Together, these techniques reduce the evaluation cost by ~40x, making large-scale evaluation feasible.

This work focuses on models that operate in a bitwise autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise watermarking framework. Our method embeds a watermark directly at the bit level of the token stream during the image generation process. Our bitwise watermark subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore, it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable detection of generated outputs.

To bridge this gap, Recent advances such as Representation Autoencoders and BLIP3-o advocate performing diffusion-based modeling directly in high level features from pretrained semantic encoders. We find editing in the semantic latent space modifies conceptual representations rather than pixels, ensuring intermediates that are both semantically coherent and visually plausible.

Building on this formulation, we introduce Object-Oriented Two-Stage Method (OOTSM), a language-based framework that anticipates object-set dynamics and forecasts object-centric relation trajectories with temporal consistency regularization, and we evaluate it on a dedicated benchmark constructed from Action Genome annotations. Extensive experiments show that compact fine-tuned language models with up to 3B parameters consistently outperform strong zero- and one-shot API baselines, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3, under matched textual inputs and context windows. When coupled with off-the-shelf visual scene-graph generators, the resulting multimodal system achieves substantial improvements on video-based SGA, boosting long-horizon mR@50 by up to 21.9\\% over strong visual SGA baselines."}

Our network, DGFusion, poses multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse conditions.

These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy.

While recent works such as Marigold and Lotus adapt diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization, their potential for structured outputs remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose SDPose, a fine-tuning framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate robustness under domain shift, we further construct COCO-OOD, a style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD. Extensive ablations highlight the importance of diffusion priors, RGB reconstruction, and multi-scale SD U-Net features for cross-domain generalization, and t-SNE analyses further explain SD's domain-invariant latent structure.

Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one- or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations. Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators.

Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short) strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization (PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead. Subsequently, we develop a joint client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm. Experiments reveal that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing benchmarks on real-world datasets. The GS-oriented objective can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g., 10%), and our method achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication costs."}

Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%.

These methods optimize a one-dimensional projection (slice) to obtain a conditional transport plan that minimizes the transport cost in the ambient space. While efficient, these methods leave open the question of whether learned optimal slicers can transfer to new distribution pairs under distributional shift. Understanding this transferability is crucial in settings with evolving data or repeated OT computations across closely related distributions. In this paper, we study the min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP) framework and investigate the transferability of optimized slicers: can a slicer trained on one distribution pair yield effective transport plans for new, unseen pairs? Theoretically, we show that optimized slicers remain close under slight perturbations of the data distributions, enabling efficient transfer across related tasks.

Existing token reduction approaches typically adopt token pruning or merging to reduce computation. However, they inherently lead to information loss as they discard or compress token representations. This problem is further exacerbated when the same fine-grained token processing is uniformly applied across all images regardless of visual complexity. We observe that not all inputs require fine-grained processing: simple images can be effectively handled at a coarse resolution, while only complex ones require refinement. Based on this insight, we propose MambaScope, an adaptive framework for efficient inference for Vision Mamba. MambaScope first performs coarse-grained inference by dividing the input image into large patches, significantly reducing token length and computation. When the model's prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at a finer resolution to recover essential visual details with minimal additional cost. This dynamic resolution assignment strategy allows MambaScope to allocate computation adaptively according to image complexity, achieving efficient processing without compromising accuracy. Experiments across various vision tasks demonstrate that MambaScope outperforms both the baseline Vision Mamba and state-of-the-art token reduction techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency."}

These attacks can cause misclassification, leading to erroneous driving decisions that compromise road safety. Moreover, within V2X networks, such misinterpretations can propagate, inducing cascading failures that disrupt overall traffic flow and system stability. However, a key limitation of current physical attacks is their lack of stealth. Most methods apply perturbations to central regions of the sign, resulting in visually salient patterns that are easily detectable by human observers, thereby limiting their real-world practicality. This study proposes TESP-Attack, a novel stealth-aware adversarial patch method for traffic sign classification. Based on the observation that human visual attention primarily focuses on the central regions of traffic signs, we employ instance segmentation to generate edge-aligned masks that conform to the shape characteristics of the signs. A U-Net generator is utilized to craft adversarial patches, which are then optimized through color and texture constraints along with frequency domain analysis to achieve seamless integration with the background environment, resulting in highly effective visual concealment. The proposed method demonstrates outstanding attack success rates across traffic sign classification models with varied architectures, achieving over 90% under limited query budgets. It also exhibits strong cross-model transferability and maintains robust real-world performance that remains stable under varying angles and distances."}

To address these limitations, we propose the first training-free multilingual approach, based on retrieval-augmented prompting. For a given aerial image, we employ a domain-adapted SigLIP2 encoder to retrieve related captions and few-shot examples from a datastore, which are then provided to a language model. We explore two variants: an image-blind setup, where a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) generates the caption from textual prompts alone, and an image-aware setup, where a Vision--Language Model (VLM) jointly processes the prompt and the input image. To improve the coherence of the retrieved content, we introduce a graph-based re-ranking strategy using PageRank on a graph of images and captions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets across ten languages demonstrate that our approach is competitive with fully supervised English-only systems and generalizes to other languages. Results also highlight the importance of re-ranking with PageRank, yielding up to 35% improvements in performance metrics. Additionally, it was observed that while VLMs tend to generate visually grounded but lexically diverse captions, LLMs can achieve stronger BLEU and CIDEr scores. Lastly, directly generating captions in the target language consistently outperforms other translation-based strategies.

To address these challenges, we propose TabletopGen, a training-free, fully automatic framework that generates diverse, instance-level interactive 3D tabletop scenes. TabletopGen accepts a reference image as input, which can be synthesized by a text-to-image model to enhance scene diversity. We then perform instance segmentation and completion on the reference to obtain per-instance images. Each instance is reconstructed into a 3D model followed by canonical coordinate alignment. The aligned 3D models then undergo pose and scale estimation before being assembled into a collision-free, simulation-ready tabletop scene. A key component of our framework is a novel pose and scale alignment approach that decouples the complex spatial reasoning into two stages: a Differentiable Rotation Optimizer for precise rotation recovery and a Top-view Spatial Alignment mechanism for robust translation and scale estimation, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D reference.

Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive fields. To address this, we employ the TransUNet architecture, a hybrid framework that integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into the U-Net structure. This combination allows the model to extract global contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution. We trained the model on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset using a robust augmentation pipeline and a hybrid loss function to mitigate class imbalance. On the validation set, the model achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient (F1-score) of 0.8799 using an optimized threshold of 0.4389.

Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression. C3 uses a simpler, pure-text pipeline that ignores factors like layout, color, and information loss from a visual encoder. This also suggests a potential upper bound for compression ratios in future work on optical character compression, OCR, and related fields.

Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors.

In materials science, ML has primarily supported large-scale discovery of novel compounds using first-principles data and digital twin applications for optimizing manufacturing processes. However, applying general-purpose ML frameworks to complex industrial materials such as steel remains a challenge. A key obstacle is accurately capturing the intricate relationship between chemical composition, processing parameters, and the resulting microstructure and properties. To address this, we introduce a computational framework that combines physical insights with ML to develop a physics-informed continuous cooling transformation (CCT) model for steels. Our model, trained on a dataset of 4,100 diagrams, is validated against literature and experimental data. It demonstrates high computational efficiency, generating complete CCT diagrams with 100 cooling curves in under 5 seconds. It also shows strong generalizability across alloy steels, achieving phase classification F1 scores above 88% for all phases. For phase transition temperature regression, it attains mean absolute errors (MAE) below 20 °C across all phases except bainite, which shows a slightly higher MAE of 27 °C. This framework can be extended with additional generic and customized ML models to establish a universal digital twin platform for heat treatment. Integration with complementary simulation tools and targeted experiments will further support accelerated materials design workflows."}

We tested our approach using different federated architectures for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-to-Computed Tomography (CT) conversion. The proposed adaptive strategy optimises the federated training by selectively freezing the encoder weights based on the monitored relative difference of the encoder weights from round to round. A patience-based mechanism ensures that freezing only occurs when updates remain consistently minimal. The energy consumption and CO2eq emissions of the federation were tracked using the CodeCarbon library. Compared to equivalent non-frozen counterparts, our approach reduced training time, total energy consumption and CO2eq emissions by up to 23%. At the same time, the MRI-to-CT conversion performance was maintained, with only small variations in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

This delta is then used to guide the denoising process of a new base model. We evaluate DS across various SD versions, demonstrating that DS achieves consistent improvements in creating desired effects (e.g., visual styles, semantic concepts, and structures) under different sampling strategies.

A critical limitation of existing fairness-aware GNN methods is their reliance on the strong assumption that sensitive attributes are fully available for all nodes during training--a condition that poses a practical impediment due to privacy concerns and data collection constraints. To address this gap, we propose a novel, model-agnostic fairness regularization framework designed for the realistic scenario where sensitive attributes are only partially available. Our approach formalizes a fairness-aware objective function that integrates both equal opportunity and statistical parity as differentiable regularization terms. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation across five real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates bias across key fairness metrics while maintaining competitive node classification performance. Results show that our framework consistently outperforms baseline models in achieving a favorable fairness-accuracy trade-off, with minimal degradation in predictive accuracy.

In this work, our aim is to interpret its structure for Flow Matching (FM). FM learns a velocity field that transports samples from a simple source distribution to data by integrating an ODE. In rectified FM, training pairs are obtained by linearly interpolating between a source sample and a data sample, and a neural velocity field is trained to predict the straight line displacement using a mean squared error loss. This squared loss collapses all velocity targets that reach the same space-time point into a single conditional mean, thereby ignoring higher order conditional information (variance, skewness, multi-modality) that encodes fine geometric structure about the data manifold and minority branches. We apply the standard risk-sensitive (log-exponential) transform to the conditional FM loss and show that the resulting tilted risk loss is a natural upper-bound on a meaningful conditional entropic FM objective defined at each space-time point. Furthermore, we show that a small order expansion of the gradient of this conditional entropic objective yields two interpretable first order corrections: covariance preconditioning of the FM residual, and a skew tail term that favors asymmetric or rare branches. On synthetic data designed to probe ambiguity and tails, the resulting risk-sensitive loss improves statistical metrics and recovers geometric structure more faithfully than standard rectified FM."}

Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct. It substantially outperforms classical SMC perturbations and RL-based methods under misalignment, and we provide theoretical guarantees that DEPF resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor."}

We prove that under mild conditions, the resulting entropy-capacity objective is strictly convex with a unique stable optimum. We evaluate on a controlled financial question answering dataset with GPT-3.5-turbo (n=200 balanced samples with synthetic hallucinations), where ECLIPSE achieves ROC AUC of 0.89 and average precision of 0.90, substantially outperforming a semantic entropy-only baseline (AUC 0.50).

To evaluate the success of their trajectories, researchers have developed verifiers, such as LLM judges and process-reward models, to score the quality of each action in an agent's trajectory. Although these heuristic scores can be informative, there are no guarantees of correctness when used to decide whether an agent will yield a successful output. Here, we introduce e-valuator, a method to convert any black-box verifier score into a decision rule with provable control of false alarm rates. We frame the problem of distinguishing successful trajectories (that is, a sequence of actions that will lead to a correct response to the user's prompt) and unsuccessful trajectories as a sequential hypothesis testing problem. E-valuator builds on tools from e-processes to develop a sequential hypothesis test that remains statistically valid at every step of an agent's trajectory, enabling online monitoring of agents over arbitrarily long sequences of actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that e-valuator provides greater statistical power and better false alarm rate control than other strategies across six datasets and three agents.

First, the canonical Shapley framework assumes that the worth function is additive, yet real-world payoff constructions--driven by non-Gaussian distributions, heavy tails, feature dependence, or domain-specific loss scales--often violate this assumption, leading to distorted attributions. Secondly, achieving sparse explanations in high dimensions by computing dense Shapley values and then applying ad hoc thresholding is prohibitively costly and risks inconsistency. We introduce Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR), a unified nonlinear explanation framework. SISR simultaneously learns a monotonic transformation to restore additivity--obviating the need for a closed-form specification--and enforces an L0 sparsity constraint on the Shapley vector, enhancing computational efficiency in large feature spaces. Its optimization algorithm leverages Pool-Adjacent-Violators for efficient isotonic regression and normalized hard-thresholding for support selection, yielding implementation ease and global convergence guarantees. Analysis shows that SISR recovers the true transformation in a wide range of scenarios and achieves strong support recovery even in high noise. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate that irrelevant features and inter-feature dependencies can induce a true payoff transformation that deviates substantially from linearity. Experiments in regression, logistic regression, and tree ensembles demonstrate that SISR stabilizes attributions across payoff schemes, correctly filters irrelevant features while standard Shapley values suffer severe rank and sign distortions. By unifying nonlinear transformation estimation with sparsity pursuit, SISR advances the frontier of nonlinear explainability, providing a theoretically grounded and practical attribution framework."}

The framework was validated through cyclic four-point bending tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with varying crack lengths, achieving accurate strain field reconstruction (R squared value > 0.9) while simultaneously producing real-time uncertainty fields. A key contribution is that the BNN yields robust full-field strain reconstructions from noisy experimental data with crack-induced strain singularities, while also providing explicit representations of two complementary uncertainty fields.

In this paper, we identify and empirically validate this phenomenon in UMGMs and provide a theoretical explanation rooted in gradient conflict between modalities. To address both intra- and inter-modal forgetting, we propose Modality-Decoupled Experts (MoDE), a lightweight and scalable architecture that isolates modality-specific updates to mitigate the gradient conflict and leverages knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting and preserve pre-trained capabilities. Unlike previous CL methods that remain modality-coupled and suffer from modality gradient conflict, MoDE explicitly decouples modalities to prevent interference. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoDE significantly mitigates both inter- and intra-modal forgetting, outperforming prior CL baselines in unified multimodal generation settings.

In the meantime, they do not give the user any hints as to whether their reasoning is on the right track, and do not give the user any recourse to stop and correct them if their reasoning is flawed. This creates a frustrating, but unfortunately common, experience: the user's time is wasted while the model reasons from a false premise that could have easily been corrected. In contrast, human speakers typically perform lightweight, incremental grounding acts to ensure that participants in the conversation are on the same page; here we ask if language models can learn to leverage a similar type of behavior? With this motivation, we propose interleaved reasoning (IR), in which the model alternates between thinking and surfacing intermediate responses, as an alternative to the standard \"think-then-answer\" approach. By providing useful information to the user earlier, IR reduces perceived latency, the time a user waits for an initial output, without compromising the quality of the final response. We further introduce a specialization of interleaved reasoning, Plantain (Plan-Thought-Answer Interleaving), where the first intermediate response is an explicit, step-by-step plan for executing the task. This plan-first strategy allows for user intervention and early feedback for subsequent reasoning steps. We demonstrate that Plantain yields an ~6% improvement in pass@1 across several challenging math reasoning and coding benchmarks, while reducing time-to-first-response by over 60% relative to think-then-answer baselines."}

However, many VLMs exhibit reduced factual recall performance compared to their LLM backbones, raising the question of how effective multimodal fine-tuning is at extending existing mechanisms within the LLM to visual inputs. We argue that factual recall based on visual inputs requires VLMs to solve a two-hop problem: (1) forming entity representations from visual inputs, and (2) recalling associated factual knowledge based on these entity representations. By benchmarking 14 VLMs with various architectures (LLaVA, Native, Cross-Attention), sizes (7B-124B parameters), and training setups on factual recall tasks against their original LLM backbone models, we find that 11 of 14 models exhibit factual recall degradation. We select three models with high and two models with low performance degradation, and use attribution patching, activation patching, and probing to show that degraded VLMs struggle to use the existing factual recall circuit of their LLM backbone, because they resolve the first hop too late in the computation. In contrast, high-performing VLMs resolve entity representations early enough to reuse the existing factual recall mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate two methods to recover performance: patching entity representations from the LLM backbone into the VLM, and prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning. Our results highlight that the speed of early entity resolution critically determines how effective VLMs are in using preexisting LLM mechanisms. More broadly, our work illustrates how mechanistic analysis can explain and unveil systematic failures in multimodal alignment."}

However, they notoriously struggle with stiff, multi-scale, and nonlinear systems due to the inherent spectral bias of standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures, which prevents them from adequately representing high-frequency components. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Spectral Physics-Enabled Network (ASPEN), a novel architecture designed to overcome this critical limitation. ASPEN integrates an adaptive spectral layer with learnable Fourier features directly into the network's input stage. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically tune its own spectral basis during training, enabling it to efficiently learn and represent the precise frequency content required by the solution. We demonstrate the efficacy of ASPEN by applying it to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), a canonical and challenging benchmark for nonlinear, stiff spatio-temporal dynamics. Our results show that a standard PINN architecture catastrophically fails on this problem, diverging into non-physical oscillations. In contrast, ASPEN successfully solves the CGLE with exceptional accuracy. The predicted solution is visually indistinguishable from the high-resolution ground truth, achieving a low median physics residual of 5.10 x 10^-3. Furthermore, we validate that ASPEN's solution is not only pointwise accurate but also physically consistent, correctly capturing emergent physical properties, including the rapid free energy relaxation and the long-term stability of the domain wall front.

Domain generalization (DG) solutions aim to address this issue by extracting domain-invariant representations that mitigate errors in unseen domains. However, in hydrological settings, each reservoir exhibits unique inflow patterns, while some metadata beyond observations like spatial information exerts indirect but significant influence. This mismatch limits the applicability of conventional DG techniques to many-domain hydrological systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose HydroDCM, a scalable DG framework for cross-reservoir inflow forecasting. Spatial metadata of reservoirs is used to construct pseudo-domain labels that guide adversarial learning of invariant temporal features. During inference, HydroDCM adapts these features through light-weight conditioning layers informed by the target reservoir's metadata, reconciling DG's invariance with location-specific adaptation.

A key finding is that TFMs can be pretrained entirely on synthetic datasets, opening opportunities to design data generators that encourage desirable model properties. Prior work has mainly focused on crafting high-quality priors over generators to improve overall pretraining performance. Our insight is that parameterizing the generator distribution enables an adversarial robustness perspective: during training, we can adapt the generator to emphasize datasets that are particularly challenging for the model. We formalize this by introducing an optimality gap measure, given by the difference between TFM performance and the best achievable performance as estimated by strong baselines such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests. Building on this idea, we propose Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM), a model-agnostic adversarial training framework. Applied to the TabPFN V2 classifier, RTFM improves benchmark performance, with up to a 6% increase in mean normalized AUC over the original TabPFN and other baseline algorithms, while requiring less than 100k additional synthetic datasets. These results highlight a promising new direction for targeted adversarial training and fine-tuning of TFMs using synthetic data alone."}

Existing strategies for memory-bounded inference, such as quantization, offloading, or heuristic KV eviction, either incur high orchestration costs or rely on unreliable attention-based proxies of importance. We propose TRIM-KV, a novel approach that learns each token's intrinsic importance at creation time via a lightweight retention gate. Each gate predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, reflecting the long-term utility of the token for a specific layer and head. Tokens with low scores are evicted when the memory budget is exceeded, ensuring that the cache always contains the most critical tokens. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently through distillation from a frozen LLM combined with a capacity loss, requiring only gate fine-tuning and adding negligible inference overhead. Across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME24), procedural generation (LongProc), conversational long-memory benchmarks (LongMemEval), and long-context understanding (LongBench and SCBench), TRIM-KV consistently outperforms strong eviction and learnable retrieval baselines, especially in low-memory regimes. Remarkably, it even surpasses full-cache models in some settings, showing that selective retention can serve as a form of regularization, suppressing noise from uninformative tokens. Qualitative analyses further reveal that learned retention scores align with human intuition, naturally recovering heuristics such as sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit design. Beyond efficiency, retention scores provide insights into layer- and head-specific roles, suggesting a new path toward LLM interpretability."}

This motivates the use of Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) for rapid, offline assessment. However, applying OPE to ad auctions is fundamentally more challenging than in domains like recommender systems, where stochastic policies are common. In online ad auctions, it is common for the highest-bidding ad to win the impression, resulting in a deterministic, winner-takes-all setting. This results in zero probability of exposure for non-winning ads, rendering standard OPE estimators inapplicable. We introduce the first principled framework for OPE in deterministic auctions by repurposing the bid landscape model to approximate the propensity score. This model allows us to derive robust approximate propensity scores, enabling the use of stable estimators like Self-Normalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) for counterfactual evaluation. We validate our approach on the AuctionNet simulation benchmark and against 2-weeks online A/B test from a large-scale industrial platform. Our method shows remarkable alignment with online results, achieving a 92\\% Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) in CTR prediction, significantly outperforming the parametric baseline.

This can be done without imposing a particular vision of individual or collective flourishing. We argue that current approaches for representing values, such as utility functions, preference orderings, or unstructured text, struggle to address these and other issues effectively. They struggle to distinguish values from other signals, to support principled normative reasoning, and to model collective goods. We propose thick models of value will be needed. These structure the way values and norms are represented, enabling systems to distinguish enduring values from fleeting preferences, to model the social embedding of individual choices, and to reason normatively, applying values in new domains. We demonstrate this approach in five areas: AI value stewardship, normatively competent agents, win-win negotiation systems, meaning-preserving economic mechanisms, and democratic regulatory institutions."}

The architecture is highly flexible: the accessibility relation between worlds can either be fixed by the user to enforce known rules or, as an inductive feature, be parameterized by a neural network. This allows the model to optionally learn the relational structure of a logical system from data while simultaneously performing deductive reasoning within that structure.This versatile construction is designed for flexibility.

However, concerns related to safety, privacy, and copyright highlight the need for machine unlearning, which can make diffusion models forget specific training data and prevent the generation of sensitive or unwanted content. Current machine unlearning methods for diffusion models are primarily designed for conditional diffusion models and focus on unlearning specific data classes or features. Among these methods, finetuning-based machine unlearning methods are recognized for their efficiency and effectiveness, which update the parameters of pre-trained diffusion models by minimizing carefully designed loss functions. However, in this paper, we propose a novel attack named Diffusion Model Relearning Attack (DiMRA), which can reverse the finetuning-based machine unlearning methods, posing a significant vulnerability of this kind of technique. Without prior knowledge of the unlearning elements, DiMRA optimizes the unlearned diffusion model on an auxiliary dataset to reverse the unlearning, enabling the model to regenerate previously unlearned elements. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel machine unlearning method for diffusion models, termed as Diffusion Model Unlearning by Memorization (DiMUM). Unlike traditional methods that focus on forgetting, DiMUM memorizes alternative data or features to replace targeted unlearning data or features in order to prevent generating such elements. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMRA in reversing state-of-the-art finetuning-based machine unlearning methods for diffusion models, highlighting the need for more robust solutions.

Interpretable Neural Networks for Time Series Regression by Learning to Mask and Aggregate", "abstract": "Time series extrinsic regression (TSER) refers to the task of predicting a continuous target variable from an input time series. It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data.To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process."}

This work provides a comprehensive treatment of Gaussian, quadratic cost OT and inner product GW (IGW) alignment, closing several gaps in the literature to broaden applicability. First, we treat the open problem of IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians on separable Hilbert spaces by giving a closed-form expression up to a quadratic optimization over unitary operators, for which we derive tight analytic upper and lower bounds. If at least one Gaussian measure is centered, the solution reduces to a fully closed-form expression, which we further extend to an analytic solution for the IGW barycenter between centered Gaussians. We also present a reduction of Gaussian multimarginal OT with pairwise quadratic costs to a tractable optimization problem and provide an efficient algorithm to solve it using a rank-deficiency constraint.

Rather than forecasting winds directly, we learn local correction patterns by assimilating the latest in-situ observations to adjust the Global Forecast System (GFS) output. We propose a transformer-based deep learning architecture that (i) handles irregular and time-varying observation sets through masking and set-based attention mechanisms, (ii) conditions predictions on recent observation-forecast pairs via cross-attention, and (iii) employs cyclical time embeddings and coordinate-aware location representations to enable single-pass inference at arbitrary spatial coordinates.

DSAS adaptively modulates the strength of existing steering transformations across layers and inputs, intervening strongly only when undesired behavior is detected. At generation time, DSAS computes context-dependent scaling factors that selectively adjust the strength of any steering method. We also show how DSAS can be jointly optimized end-to-end together with the steering function. When combined with existing steering methods, DSAS consistently improves the Pareto front with respect to steering alone, achieving a better trade-off between toxicity mitigation and utility preservation.

We discover that evolving feature semantics-particularly objective and subjective meanings-introduce concept drift over time. Crucially, we identify that feature transformation strategies are able to mitigate discrepancies in feature representations across temporal stages. Motivated by these insights, we propose a feature-aware temporal modulation mechanism that conditions feature representations on temporal context, modulating statistical properties such as scale and skewness.

However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems. Models trained on different datasets have highly similar representations of small molecules, and machine learning interatomic potentials converge in representation space as they improve in performance, suggesting that foundation models learn a common underlying representation of physical reality. We then show two distinct regimes of scientific models: on inputs similar to those seen during training, high-performing models align closely and weak models diverge into local sub-optima in representation space; on vastly different structures from those seen during training, nearly all models collapse onto a low-information representation, indicating that today's models remain limited by training data and inductive bias and do not yet encode truly universal structure.

This is enough to detect changes as small as one step of fine-tuning, making this approach more sensitive than existing methods while being 1,000x cheaper. We introduce the TinyChange benchmark as a way to measure the sensitivity of audit methods in the context of small, realistic model changes."}

To this end, we introduce DVPO (Distributional Value Modeling with Risk-aware Policy Optimization), a new RL framework that combines conditional risk theory with distributional value modeling to better balance robustness and generalization. DVPO learns token-level value distributions to provide fine-grained supervision, and applies an asymmetric risk regularization to shape the distribution tails: it contracts the lower tail to dampen noisy negative deviations, while expanding the upper tail to preserve exploratory diversity. Across extensive experiments and analysis in multi-turn dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific QA, DVPO consistently outperforms PPO, GRPO, and robust Bellman-based PPO under noisy supervision, showing its potential for LLM post-training in the real-world."}

To address this issue, we propose an acceleration method based on replacing costly loss function evaluations with an efficient surrogate. Unlike previously defined surrogates, our approach relies on unbiased estimators reducing the risk of spurious local optima and can provide information on its local confidence allowing one to switch to a fallback method when needed. Furthermore, the surrogate is designed for a black-box setting, which enables compensating for simplifications in the optimization model and account- ing for recourse actions during cost computation.

Previous efforts have primarily centered around studying more effective FSCIL approaches. By contrast, less attention was devoted to thinking the security issues in contributing to FSCIL. This paper aims to provide a holistic study of the impact of attacks on FSCIL. We first derive insights by systematically exploring how human expert-designed attack methods (i.e., PGD, FGSM) affect FSCIL. We find that those methods either fail to attack base classes, or suffer from huge labor costs due to relying on huge expert knowledge. This highlights the need to craft a specialized attack method for FSCIL. Grounded in these insights, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective ACraft method to automatically steer and discover optimal attack methods targeted at FSCIL by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) without human experts. Moreover, to improve the reasoning between LLMs and FSCIL, we introduce a novel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning to optimize learning, making LLMs generate better attack methods in the next generation by establishing positive feedback. Experiments on mainstream benchmarks show that our ACraft significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art FSCIL methods and dramatically beyond human expert-designed attack methods while maintaining the lowest costs of attack."}

In this work we introduce a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets. In particular, this perspective shows that the fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions of pairwise distances. More generally, the framework connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models on the face poset, clarifies the relation between Kullback-Leibler divergence and fuzzy cross-entropy in this setting, and recovers standard t-norms and t-conorms via Boolean operations on the underlying simplicial sets. We then show how new embedding methods may be derived from this framework and illustrate this on an example where we generalize UMAP using Čech filtrations with triplet sampling.

To address these limitations, we propose a Discrete Variable (DV)-Circuit Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) and apply it to three typical reservoir seepage models for the first time: the pressure diffusion equation for heterogeneous single-phase flow, the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation for two-phase waterflooding, and the convection-diffusion equation for compositional flow considering adsorption.

We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs.

Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix.

The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models.

Pure data-driven methods lack physical explanations and have poor generalization when observed data is sparse.

To bridge this gap, recent studies have explored combining them by embedding physical structure into Gaussian process. These approaches typically introduce the governing equations as soft constraints through pseudo-observations, enabling the integration of model structure within a variational framework. However, these methods rely heavily on penalty tuning and lack principled uncertainty calibration, which makes them sensitive to model mis-specification. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a novel Physics-Embedded Gaussian Process (PEGP), designed to integrate domain knowledge with data-driven methods in traffic state estimation. Specifically, we design two multi-output kernels informed by classic traffic flow models, constructed via the explicit application of the linearized differential operator. Experiments on HighD, NGSIM show consistent improvements over non-physics baselines. PEGP-ARZ proves more reliable under sparse observation, while PEGP-LWR achieves lower errors with denser observation. Ablation study further reveals that PEGP-ARZ residuals align closely with physics and yield calibrated, interpretable uncertainty, whereas PEGP-LWR residuals are more orthogonal and produce nearly constant variance fields. This PEGP framework combines physical priors, uncertainty quantification, which can provide reliable support for TSE."}

We provide an in-depth characterization of multi-class CE optimization dynamics beyond the convex regime by analyzing a canonical two-layer linear neural network with standard-basis vectors as inputs: the simplest non-convex extension for which the implicit bias remained unknown. This model coincides with the unconstrained features model used to study neural collapse, making our work the first to prove that gradient flow on CE converges to the neural collapse geometry. We construct an explicit Lyapunov function that establishes global convergence, despite the presence of spurious critical points in the non-convex landscape. A key insight underlying our analysis is an inconspicuous finding: Hadamard Initialization diagonalizes the softmax operator, freezing the singular vectors of the weight matrices and reducing the dynamics entirely to their singular values.

We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework.

We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets.

Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections. These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning performance."}

Based on these LLMs, businesses have started to provide Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS), offering feature extraction capabilities (in the form of text embeddings) that benefit downstream natural language processing tasks. However, prior research has demonstrated that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks, where an attacker clones the service's model in a black-box manner without access to the model's internal workings. In response, watermarks have been added to the text embeddings to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers by allowing them to check for model ownership. This thesis focuses on defending against imitation attacks by investigating EaaS watermarks. To achieve this goal, we unveil novel attacks and propose and validate new watermarking techniques.Firstly, we show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed through paraphrasing the input text when attackers clone the model during imitation attacks. Our study illustrates that paraphrasing can effectively bypass current state-of-the-art EaaS watermarks across various attack setups (including different paraphrasing techniques and models) and datasets in most instances. This demonstrates a new vulnerability in recent EaaS watermarking techniques.Subsequently, as a countermeasure, we propose a novel watermarking technique, WET (Watermarking EaaS with Linear Transformation), which employs linear transformation of the embeddings. Watermark verification is conducted by applying a reverse transformation and comparing the similarity between recovered and original embeddings. We demonstrate its robustness against paraphrasing attacks with near-perfect verifiability. We conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the significance of each component and hyperparameter in WET."}

Such systems often display sensitive dependence on initial conditions, reflected in positive Lyapunov exponents, where even small perturbations in short-term forecasts can lead to large deviations in long-term outcomes. Thus, meaningful inference requires not only accurate short-term predictions, but also consistency with the system's long-term attractor that is captured by the marginal distribution of state variables. Existing approaches attempt to address this challenge by incorporating spatial and temporal dependence, but these strategies become impractical when data are extremely sparse. In this work, we show that prior knowledge of marginal distributions offers valuable complementary information to short-term observations, motivating a distribution-informed learning framework. We introduce a calibration algorithm based on normalization and the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy (KSD) to enhance ML predictions. The method here employs KSD within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space to calibrate model outputs, improving their fidelity to known physical distributions. This not only sharpens pointwise predictions but also enforces consistency with non-local statistical structures rooted in physical principles. Through synthetic experiments-spanning offline climatological CO2 fluxes and online quasi-geostrophic flow simulations-we demonstrate the robustness and broad utility of the proposed framework."}

In many cases, it could be useful to have emergency shutdown mechanisms which effectively prevent misaligned agents from carrying out harmful actions in the world. We introduce password-activated shutdown protocols (PAS protocols) -- methods for designing frontier agents to implement a safe shutdown protocol when given a password. We motivate PAS protocols by describing intuitive use-cases in which they mitigate risks from misaligned systems that subvert other control efforts, for instance, by disabling automated monitors or self-exfiltrating to external data centres. PAS protocols supplement other safety efforts, such as alignment fine-tuning or monitoring, contributing to defence-in-depth against AI risk. We provide a concrete demonstration in SHADE-Arena, a benchmark for AI monitoring and subversion capabilities, in which PAS protocols supplement monitoring to increase safety with little cost to performance. Next, PAS protocols should be robust to malicious actors who want to bypass shutdown. Therefore, we conduct a red-team blue-team game between the developers (blue-team), who must implement a robust PAS protocol, and a red-team trying to subvert the protocol. We conduct experiments in a code-generation setting, finding that there are effective strategies for the red-team, such as using another model to filter inputs, or fine-tuning the model to prevent shutdown behaviour. We then outline key challenges to implementing PAS protocols in real-life systems, including: security considerations of the password and decisions regarding when, and in which systems, to use them. PAS protocols are an intuitive mechanism for increasing the safety of frontier AI. We encourage developers to consider implementing PAS protocols prior to internal deployment of particularly dangerous systems to reduce loss-of-control risks."}

Ultra-strong gradients (up to 300 mT/m) can mitigate these limitations by improving SNR and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) but their adoption has until recently been limited to research environments due to challenges with peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds and gradient non-uniformity. This study investigates whether physics-informed self-supervised VERDICT (ssVERDICT) fitting applied to ultra-strong gradients enhances prostate cancer characterization relative to current clinical acquisitions. We developed enhanced ssVERDICT fitting approaches using dense multilayer perceptron (Dense MLP) and convolutional U-Net architectures, benchmarking them against non-linear least-squares (NLLS) fitting and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging across clinical- to ultra-strong gradient systems. Dense ssVERDICT at ultra-strong gradient notably outperformed NLLS VERDICT, boosting median CNR by 47%, cutting inter-patient Coefficient of Variation by 52%, and reducing pooled f_ic variation by 50%. Overall, it delivered the highest CNR, the most stable parameter estimates, and the clearest tumour-normal contrast compared with conventional methods and clinical gradient systems.

Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

Gaussian equivalence theory (GET) has emerged as a powerful universality principle in this context: it states that the behavior of high-dimensional, complex features can be captured by Gaussian surrogates, which are more amenable to analysis. Despite its remarkable successes, numerical experiments show that this equivalence can fail even for simple embeddings -- such as polynomial maps -- under general scaling regimes.We investigate this breakdown in the setting of random feature (RF) models in the quadratic scaling regime, where both the number of features and the sample size grow quadratically with the data dimension. We show that when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the data, such as generalized linear models, GET yields incorrect predictions. To capture the correct asymptotics, we introduce a Conditional Gaussian Equivalent (CGE) model, which can be viewed as appending a low-dimensional non-Gaussian component to an otherwise high-dimensional Gaussian model. This hybrid model retains the tractability of the Gaussian framework and accurately describes RF models in the quadratic scaling regime. We derive sharp asymptotics for the training and test errors in this setting, which continue to agree with numerical simulations even when GET fails.Our analysis combines general results on CLT for Wiener chaos expansions and a careful two-phase Lindeberg swapping argument. Beyond RF models and quadratic scaling, our work hints at a rich landscape of universality phenomena in high-dimensional ERM."}

To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training.

The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \\textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \\textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment. We use interpretability tools to show that this semantic overwrite emerges layer by layer, with benign meanings in early layers converging into harmful semantics in later ones.

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods."}

Recent advances in digital twins (DTs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer new opportunities for real-time, data-driven optimization across a vehicle's lifecycle. However, integrating these technologies into a unified framework remains an open challenge. This work presents a DT-based control co-design (CCD) framework for full-vehicle active suspensions using multi-generation design concepts. By integrating automatic differentiation into DRL, we jointly optimize physical suspension components and control policies under varying driver behaviors and environmental uncertainties. DRL also addresses the challenge of partial observability, where only limited states can be sensed and fed back to the controller, by learning optimal control actions directly from available sensor information. The framework incorporates model updating with quantile learning to capture data uncertainty, enabling real-time decision-making and adaptive learning from digital-physical interactions. The approach demonstrates personalized optimization of suspension systems under two distinct driving settings (mild and aggressive). Results show that the optimized systems achieve smoother trajectories and reduce control efforts by approximately 43% and 52% for mild and aggressive, respectively, while maintaining ride comfort and stability.

We provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing (ALF-LB) procedure -- proposed by DeepSeek's Wang et al.

First, in a stylized deterministic setting, our framework yields several insightful structural properties: (i) a monotonic improvement of a Lagrangian objective, (ii) a preference rule that moves tokens from overloaded to underloaded experts, and (iii) an approximate-balancing guarantee. Then, we incorporate the stochastic and dynamic nature of AI training using a generalized online optimization formulation. In the online setting, we derive a strong convexity property of the objective that leads to a logarithmic expected regret bound under certain step-size choices. Additionally, we present real experiments on 1B-parameter DeepSeekMoE models to complement our theoretical findings.

To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution.

In practice, a common workaround is to evaluate algorithms on smaller proxy instances derived from the original inputs. However, this practice has remained largely ad hoc and lacked theoretical grounding. We provide the first theoretical foundations for this practice by formalizing the notion of size generalization: predicting an algorithm's performance on a large instance by evaluating it on a smaller, representative instance, subsampled from the original instance. We provide size generalization guarantees for three widely used clustering algorithms (single-linkage, $k$-means++, and Gonzalez's $k$-centers heuristic) and two canonical max-cut algorithms (Goemans-Williamson and Greedy).

To illustrate this approach, we built FairDream, a fairness package whose mechanism is made transparent for lay users, increasing the model's weights of errors on disadvantaged groups. While a user may intend to achieve Demographic Parity by the correction method, experiments show that FairDream tends towards Equalized Odds, revealing a conservative bias inherent to the data environment. We clarify the relationship between these fairness criteria, analyze FairDream's reweighting process, and compare its trade-offs with closely related GridSearch models.

Our asymptotic results include the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem, and the law of iterated logarithms, while our non-asymptotic bounds include Azuma-Hoeffding-type inequalities and a non-asymptotic version of the law of iterated logarithms. Additionally, we explore two key implications of our results. First, we analyze the sample path behavior of the difference in rewards between any two stationary policies. Second, we show that two alternative definitions of regret for learning policies proposed in the literature are rate-equivalent. Our proof techniques rely on a martingale decomposition of cumulative reward, properties of the solution to the policy evaluation fixed-point equation, and both asymptotic and non-asymptotic concentration results for martingale difference sequences."}

We focus on a specific scenario where $n+m$ items are to be ranked by some ``black box'' algorithm. It is assumed that the relative (ground truth) ranking of $n$ of them is known. The objective is then to quantify the error made by the algorithm on the ranks of the $m$ new items among the total $(n+m)$. In such a setting, the true ranks of the $n$ original items in the total $(n+m)$ depend on the (unknown) true ranks of the $m$ new ones. Consequently, we have no direct access to a calibration set to apply a classical CP method. To address this challenge, we propose to construct distribution-free bounds of the unknown conformity scores using recent results on the distribution of conformal p-values. Using these scores upper bounds, we provide valid prediction sets for the rank of any item. We also control the false coverage proportion, a crucial quantity when dealing with multiple prediction sets. Finally, we empirically show on both synthetic and real data the efficiency of our CP method for state-of-the-art algorithms such as RankNet or LambdaMart."}

This study examines whether integrating multi-variable weather-station measurements with radar can enhance nowcasting skill and introduces two complementary architectures that integrate multi-variable station data with radar images. The SmaAt-fUsion model extends the SmaAt-UNet framework by incorporating weather station data through a convolutional layer, integrating it into the bottleneck of the network; The SmaAt-Krige-GNet model combines precipitation maps with weather station data processed using Kriging, a geo-statistical interpolation method, to generate variable-specific maps. These maps are then utilized in a dual-encoder architecture based on SmaAt-GNet, allowing multi-level data integration . Experimental evaluations were conducted using four years (2016--2019) of weather station and precipitation radar data from the Netherlands. Results demonstrate that SmaAt-Krige-GNet outperforms the standard SmaAt-UNet, which relies solely on precipitation radar data, in low precipitation scenarios, while SmaAt-fUsion surpasses SmaAt-UNet in both low and high precipitation scenarios.

We begin by investigating the training protocol, revealing a key issue in how model selection performs. While existing approaches use temporal ordering for splitting validation set, we show that even a random split can significantly improve model performance. By minimizing the time lag between training data and test time, while reducing the bias in validation, our proposed training protocol significantly improves generalization across various methods. Furthermore, we analyze how temporal data affects deep tabular representations, uncovering that these models often fail to capture crucial periodic and trend information. To address this gap, we introduce a plug-and-play temporal embedding method based on Fourier series expansion to learn and incorporate temporal patterns, offering an adaptive approach to handle temporal shifts. Our experiments demonstrate that this temporal embedding, combined with the improved training protocol, provides a more effective and robust framework for learning from temporal tabular data."}

Label-specific features (LSFs), constructed by LIFT, have proven effective for learning tasks with label ambiguity by leveraging clustering-based prototypes for each label to re-characterize instances. However, directly introducing LIFT into LDL tasks can be suboptimal, as the prototypes it collects primarily reflect intra-cluster relationships while neglecting cross-cluster interactions. Additionally, constructing LSFs using multi-perspective information, rather than relying solely on Euclidean distance, provides a more robust and comprehensive representation of instances, mitigating noise and bias that may arise from a single distance perspective. To address these limitations, we introduce Structural Anchor Points (SAPs) to capture inter-cluster interactions. This leads to a novel LSFs construction strategy, LIFT-SAP, which enhances LIFT by integrating both distance and directional information of each instance relative to SAPs. Furthermore, we propose a novel LDL algorithm, Label Distribution Learning via Label-specifIc FeaTure with SAPs (LDL-LIFT-SAP), which unifies multiple label description degrees predicted from different LSF spaces into a cohesive label distribution.

To address these limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories, supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. At the core of our model is a modular architecture comprising: (i) an encoding layer, adapted from protein folding models, that embeds protein-specific information and conformation at each time frame into a latent space; (ii) a temporal module, a sequence model that captures conformational dynamics across frames; and (iii) an SE(3) diffusion model as the structure decoder, generating conformations in continuous space.

We present an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN architecture that integrates immersed boundary method (IBM) principles to solve FSI problems with moving boundary conditions. Our approach fundamentally departs from conventional unified architectures by introducing domain-specific neural networks: an Eulerian network for fluid dynamics and a Lagrangian network for structural interfaces, coupled through physics-based constraints. Additionally, we incorporate learnable B-spline activation functions with SiLU to capture both localized high-gradient features near interfaces and global flow patterns. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that while baseline unified PINNs achieve reasonable velocity predictions, they suffer from substantial pressure errors (12.9%) in structural regions. Our Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture with learnable activations (EL-L) achieves better performance across all metrics, improving accuracy by 24.1-91.4% and particularly reducing pressure errors from 12.9% to 2.39%. These results demonstrate that domain decomposition aligned with physical principles, combined with locality-aware activation functions, is essential for accurate FSI modeling within the PINN framework."}

Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition-prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called Co-Learnability.

Unlike existing approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity.

This paper explores run-time control-flow anomaly detection using process mining to enhance the resilience of ERTMS/ETCS L2 (European Rail Traffic Management System / European Train Control System Level 2). Process mining allows learning the actual control flow of the system from its execution traces, thus enabling run-time monitoring through online conformance checking. In addition, anomaly localization is performed through unsupervised machine learning to link relevant deviations to critical system components. We test our approach on a reference ERTMS/ETCS L2 scenario, namely the RBC/RBC Handover, to show its capability to detect and localize anomalies with high accuracy, efficiency, and explainability."}

This paper critically examines common datasets and reported metrics for a crystal structure prediction task$\\unicode{x2014}$generating the most likely structures given the chemical composition of a material. We focus on three key issues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for example, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains $\\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split randomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we find to be the case for the perov-5 and MP-20 datasets. Third, benchmarks can mislead if used uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the structural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these oft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions of the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and split by number of atoms $N$, one with enantiomorphs, and two containing only identical structures but with different unit cells. We also propose new splits for datasets with polymorphs, ensuring that polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more sensible standard for benchmarking model performance. Finally, we present METRe and cRMSE, new model evaluation metrics that can correct existing issues with the match rate metric."}

In this work, we present the first formal theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware decision-making, in which the behaviour of the agent is directed towards optimizing a measure of long-run performance beyond the mean.

An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the topological and geometrical properties of its state space.

In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully on-policy data."}

This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats, and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format. Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks, including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle, demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%."}

As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models."}

This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness.

Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from.

As car manufactures keep developing SAE level 3+ systems to improve the safety and comfort of passengers, traffic authorities need to establish new procedures to manage the transition from human-driven to fully-autonomous vehicles while providing a feedback-loop mechanism to fine-tune envisioned autonomous systems. Thus, a way to automatically profile autonomous vehicles and differentiate those from human-driven ones is a must. In this paper, we present a fully-fledged framework that monitors active vehicles using camera images and state information in order to determine whether vehicles are autonomous, without requiring any active notification from the vehicles themselves. Essentially, it builds on the cooperation among vehicles, which share their data acquired on the road feeding a machine learning model to identify autonomous cars. We extensively tested our solution and created the NexusStreet dataset, by means of the CARLA simulator, employing an autonomous driving control agent and a steering wheel maneuvered by licensed drivers. Experiments show it is possible to discriminate the two behaviors by analyzing video clips with an accuracy of 80%, which improves up to 93% when the target state information is available. Lastly, we deliberately degraded the state to observe how the framework performs under non-ideal data collection conditions."}

To navigate safely, this understanding must be derived from sensor data in real-time and needs to be represented in vectorized form. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to combine a set of camera images from multiple views into one joint latent BEV grid. Traditionally, from this latent space, an intermediate raster map is predicted, providing dense spatial supervision but requiring post-processing into the desired vectorized form. More recent models directly derive infrastructure elements as polylines using vectorized map decoders, providing instance-level information. Our approach, Augmentation Map Network (AugMapNet), proposes latent BEV feature grid augmentation, a novel technique that significantly enhances the latent BEV representation. AugMapNet combines vector decoding and dense spatial supervision more effectively than existing architectures while remaining easy to integrate compared to other hybrid approaches. It additionally benefits from extra processing on its latent BEV features. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate significant improvements on vectorized map prediction of up to 13.3% over the StreamMapNet baseline on 60 m range and greater improvements on larger ranges. We confirm transferability by applying our method to another baseline, SQD-MapNet, and find similar improvements.

This paper develops a new method, Wasserstein--Aitchison Generative Adversarial Networks (WA-GAN) to, which provides simulated values of $d$-dimensional multivariate extreme events and which can hence be used to give estimates of such probabilities. The main hypothesis is that, after transforming the observations to the unit-Pareto scale, their distribution is regularly varying in the sense that the distributions of their radial and angular components (with respect to the $L_1$-norm) converge and become asymptotically independent as the radius gets large. The method is a combination of standard extreme value analysis modeling of the tails of the marginal distributions with nonparametric GAN modeling of the angular distribution. For the latter, the angular values are transformed to Aitchison coordinates in a full $(d-1)$-dimensional linear space, and a Wasserstein GAN is trained on these coordinates and used to generate new values. A reverse transformation is then applied to these values and gives simulated values on the original data scale. Our method is applied to simulated data and to a financial data set from the Kenneth French Data Library. The method shows good performance compared to other existing methods in the literature, both in terms of capturing the dependence structure of the extremes in the data and in generating accurate new extremes."}

By equipping the DRL agent with an enhanced state representation that includes blockage history, and a stability-centric reward function, we enable it to prioritize long-term link quality over transient gains. Validated in a challenging 100-user scenario using the Sionna library, our agent achieves throughput comparable to a reactive Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) baseline.

In contrast, we learn from observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence. We further extend our framework to handle heterogeneous cost preferences via an interval-conditioned architecture.

Objective: To address this gap, we derive a taxonomy encompassing 147 SE tasks and apply an SE-oriented classification to PTMs in a popular open-source ML repository, Hugging Face (HF). Method: Our repository mining study followed a five-phase pipeline: (i) identification SE tasks from the literature; (ii) collection of PTM data from the HF API, including model card descriptions and metadata, and the abstracts of the associated arXiv papers; (iii) text processing to ensure consistency; (iv) a two-phase validation of SE relevance, involving humans and LLM assistance, supported by five pilot studies with human annotators and a generalization test; (v) and data analysis. This process yielded a curated catalogue of 2,205 SE PTMs. Results: We find that most SE PTMs target code generation and coding, emphasizing implementation over early or late development stages. In terms of ML tasks, text generation dominates within SE PTMs. Notably, the number of SE PTMs has increased markedly since 2023 Q2, while evaluation remains limited: only 9.6% report benchmark results, mostly scoring below 50%.

This paper revisits the question and establishes new foundations for provable copyright protection -- foundations that are firmer both technically and legally. First, we show that NAF alone does not prevent infringement. In fact, NAF models can enable verbatim copying, a blatant failure of copy protection that we dub being tainted. Then, we introduce our blameless copy protection framework for defining meaningful guarantees, and instantiate it with clean-room copy protection. Clean-room copy protection allows a user to control their risk of copying by behaving in a way that is unlikely to copy in a counterfactual clean-room setting.

Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra, specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of 1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations, optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel optimization. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL."}

To address this critical gap, we introduce PEHRT, a common pipeline for harmonizing EHR data for translational research. PEHRT is a comprehensive, ready-to-use resource that includes open-source code, visualization tools, and detailed documentation to streamline the process of preparing EHR data for analysis. The pipeline provides tools to harmonize structured and unstructured EHR data to standardized ontologies to ensure consistency across diverse coding systems. In the presence of unmapped or heterogeneous local codes, PEHRT further leverages representation learning and pre-trained language models to generate robust embeddings that capture semantic relationships across sites to mitigate heterogeneity and enable integrative downstream analyses. PEHRT also supports cross-institutional co-training through shared representations, allowing participating sites to collaboratively refine embeddings and enhance generalizability without sharing individual-level data. The framework is data model-agnostic and can be seamlessly deployed across diverse healthcare systems to produce interoperable, research-ready datasets. By lowering the technical barriers to EHR-based research, PEHRT empowers investigators to transform raw clinical data into reproducible, analysis-ready resources for discovery and innovation."}

Our network, DGFusion, poses multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse conditions.

For an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present ECHO-MIMIC, a general computational framework that converts this global complexity into a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference \\& Messaging for Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We demonstrate this framework on two distinct ISPs: a canonical agricultural landscape management problem and a carbon-aware EV charging time slot usage problem. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align simulated agent behavior with system-level goals. By coupling algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms the cognitive burden of collective action into a implementable set of agent-level instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design."}

At its core, Fed-Span leverages minimum spanning tree (MST) and minimum spanning forest (MSF) topologies to introduce spanning model aggregation and dispatching processes for distributed learning. To formalize Fed-Span, we offer a fresh perspective on MST/MSF topologies by formulating them through a set of continuous constraint representations (CCRs), thereby integrating these topologies into a distributed learning framework for satellite networks. Using these CCRs, we obtain the energy consumption and latency of operations in Fed-Span.

We unveil that this problem is NP-hard and develop a systematic approach to transform it into a geometric programming formulation, solved via successive convex optimization with performance guarantees.

Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one- or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations. Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes.

Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in general overparameterized deep matrix factorization (i.e., deep linear neural network training) problems, resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff & Michaeli (2020). This expression uncovers a fundamental property of the loss landscape of depth-2 matrix factorization problems: a minimum is flat if and only if it is spectral-norm balanced, which implies that flat minima are not necessarily Frobenius-norm balanced. Furthermore, to complement our theory, we empirically investigate an escape phenomenon observed during gradient-based training near a minimum that crucially relies on our exact expression of the sharpness."}

We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%.

Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

In this work, we establish a rigorous correspondence between the topological phase transitions of random geometric graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we show that this metric captures structural pathologies, such as implicit mode collapse, where standard statistical metrics fail.

Existing approaches typically assume predefined task collections, an assumption that fails in novel environments where tool semantics and affordances are initially unknown. To address this limitation, we formalize the problem of Task Generation for Agentic RL, where an agent must learn within a given environment that lacks predefined tasks. We propose CuES, a Curiosity driven and Environment grounded Synthesis framework that autonomously generates diverse, executable, and meaningful tasks directly from the environment structure and affordances, without relying on handcrafted seeds or external corpora. CuES drives exploration through intrinsic curiosity, abstracts interaction patterns into reusable task schemas, and refines them through lightweight top down guidance and memory based quality control. Across three representative environments, AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop, CuES produces task distributions that match or surpass manually curated datasets in both diversity and executability, yielding substantial downstream policy improvements.

However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes. We also find that 4/6 can be easily incorporated into many different post-training quantization methods and generally improves downstream accuracy. We hope this inspires future work in training and deploying models with NVFP4. Our code is available atthis http URL."}

We evaluate multiple widely used coding agents with frontier models on this benchmark. Disturbingly, all agents perform poorly in terms of software security. Although 61% of the solutions from SWE-Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet are functionally correct, only 10.5% are secure. Further experiments demonstrate that preliminary security strategies, such as augmenting the feature request with vulnerability hints, cannot mitigate these security issues. Our findings raise serious concerns about the widespread adoption of vibe-coding, particularly in security-sensitive applications."}

Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption."}

With the expanding usage of open-source libraries, it becomes even more imperative to comprehend and address these dependency vulnerabilities. The use of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools does greatly help here as they provide a deep insight on what dependencies are used in a project, enhancing the security and integrity in the software supply chain. In order to learn how wide spread vulnerabilities are and how quickly they are being fixed, we conducted a study on over 1k open-source software projects with about 50k releases comprising several languages such as Java, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. Our objective is to investigate the severity, persistence, and distribution of these vulnerabilities, as well as their correlation with project metrics such as team and contributors size, activity and release cycles. In order to perform such analysis, we crawled over 1k projects from github including their version history ranging from 2013 to 2023 using VODA, our SCA tool. Using our approach, we can provide information such as library versions, dependency depth, and known vulnerabilities, and how they evolved over the software development cycle. Being larger and more diverse than datasets used in earlier works and studies, ours provides better insights and generalizability of the gained results. The data collected answers several research questions about the dependency depth and the average time a vulnerability persists. Among other findings, we observed that for most programming languages, vulnerable dependencies are transitive, and a critical vulnerability persists in average for over a year before being fixed."}

Our approach lets library authors provide different pre-defined automation levels while giving end-users the ability to further customize quantifier availability at the module, function, or proof context level.We implement our techniques in Verus, a Rust-based verification tool, and evaluate them on multiple openly available codebases.

Efficient stack management remains a significant challenge for effect handlers due to the dynamic control flow changes they introduce. This paper explores a novel stack management approach using user-level overcommitting within the libseff C library, which leverages virtual memory mechanisms and protection-based lazy allocation combined with signal-driven memory commitment. Our user-level overcommitting implementation dynamically resizes stacks on-demand, improving memory utilization and reducing waste compared to traditional methods. We rigorously benchmark and evaluate this novel strategy against conventional fixed- size stacks, segmented stacks, and kernel-based overcommitting, using metrics such as context-switch latency, stack expansion efficiency, multi-threaded performance, and robustness under rapid stack growth conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that kernel-based overcommitting achieves an effective balance between performance and flexibility, whereas our user-level implementation, while flexible, incurs additional overheads, highlighting areas for optimization.

We propose a symbolic method for active learning of decision trees, in which approximate model counting is used to estimate the reduction of the hypothesis space caused by each potential query, enabling near-optimal query selection without full model enumeration. The resulting learner incrementally strengthens a CNF representation based on observed query outcomes, and approximate model counter ApproxMC is invoked to quantify the remaining version space in a sound and scalable manner. Additionally, when ApproxMC stagnates, a functional equivalence check is performed to verify that all remaining hypotheses are functionally identical.

However, sustainability-related legislation and the growing costs of energy-hungry software increase the importance of energy efficiency for these systems. While some proposals for architectural tactics and patterns exist, their effectiveness as well as potential trade-offs on other quality attributes (QAs) remain unclear. Goal: We therefore aim to study the effectiveness of microservices tactics and patterns to reduce energy consumption, as well as potential trade-offs with performance and maintainability. Method: Using the open-source Online Boutique system, we conducted a controlled experiment with three tactics and three patterns, and analyzed the impact of each technique compared to a baseline. We also tested with three levels of simulated request loads (low, medium, high). Results: Request load moderated the effectiveness of reducing energy consumption. All techniques (tactics and patterns) reduced the energy consumption for at least one load level, up to 5.6%. For performance, the techniques could negatively impact response time by increasing it by up to 25.9%, while some also decreased it by up to 72.5%. Two techniques increased the throughput, by 1.9% and 34.0%. For maintainability, three techniques had a negative, one a positive, and two no impact. Conclusion: Some techniques reduced energy consumption while also improving performance. However, these techniques usually involved a trade-off in maintainability, e.g., via more code duplication and module coupling. Overall, all techniques significantly reduced energy consumption at higher loads, but most of them sacrificed one of the other QAs. This highlights that the real challenge is not simply reducing energy consumption of microservices, but to achieve energy efficiency."}

This framework transforms natural language instructions into structured GeoJSON operations through two LLM enhancement techniques: Function Calling and Code Generation. The architecture integrates three core components: task parsing, agent collaboration, and result integration. The Planner agent systematically decomposes user-defined tasks into executable subtasks, while Worker agents perform spatial data processing and analysis either by invoking predefined function APIs or by generating and executing Python-based analytical code. The system produces reusable, standards-compliant GeoJSON outputs through iterative refinement. To evaluate both approaches, we constructed a benchmark comprising 70 tasks spanning basic, intermediate, and advanced complexity levels, conducting experiments with OpenAI's GPT-4o as the core model.

Efficient kernels are crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning. Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra, specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of 1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations, optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast math operations to yield substantial performance gains.
